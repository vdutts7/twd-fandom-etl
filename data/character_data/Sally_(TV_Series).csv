,,Nothing is known about Sally's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point during the outbreak, Sally joined a community in Ohio. Sally is among a group of servers working the Halloween masquerade ball in Union Station . As Magna and other servers fill glasses of wine and take the trays out to guests, Sally is cutting fruit and arranging them on a platter. She comments to Magna how she can almost taste the mango and how she wishes her kids can have some. A hopeful Magna tells Sally that maybe her kids will have some one day, to which Sally scoffs at that idea, saying her kids will never get to try mango, indirectly referring to the class divides in the Commonwealth. She then proceeds to bring the fruit platter out to the party. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Sally's fate is left unknown. It is possible she was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",This list shows the victims Sally has killed: Possibly numerous counts of zombies,The Commonwealth Magna - Co-Worker,""" New Haunts """
