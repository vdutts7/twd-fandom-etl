Overview
[
]


At first, Margo seemed to have integrated herself into the community well. After 
Ozzy
's death, she appears to be the main voice for the 
Highwaymen
 as shown at the council meeting. She great desires revenge against the 
Whisperers
 for causing the deaths of Ozzy and 
Alek
. However, she takes her anger out on 
Lydia
, a former Whisperer, bullying her along with 
Alfred
 and 
Gage
. At night, the three ambush her, with Margo being the main leader. She throws the first punch and proceeds to beat Lydia with Alfred. When Gage begins to hesitate, Margo peer pressures him into joining in. In the end, this action would lead to her death, when 
Negan
 saves Lydia, but accidentally kills Margo in the process.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[

Nothing is known about Margo's life prior to or as the outbreak began.

At some point following the outbreak, Margo joined a group of survivors known as "
the Highwaymen
".



Season 10
[

"
Lines We Cross
"
[
]


Some months after the blizzard, Margo is among the 
Coalition
 members drafted into the militia that was formed in response to the 
Whisperer
 threat. She and the other militia conduct a training exercise on the 
Oceanside
 beach. As 
Ezekiel
 and 
Jerry
 methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Margo and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat.

They are successful and return to Oceanside to rest, eat, and socialize with the Oceansiders. That night, Margo helps put out the fire that was ignited in the woods in Whisperer territory after a satellite from outer space crashes.



"
Ghosts
"
[
]


At an emergency council meeting to discuss the incoming waves of walkers in 
Alexandria
, Margo demands revenge for the death of her friends by 
Alpha
. However, she overlooks the possible consequences that could bring by killing Alpha without a proper plan. Margo then listens as 
Michonne
 tells everyone instead of retaliating, she and a small group will meet with Alpha at the border to work things out. She then continues to work alongside the Alexandrians and coalition soldiers to take out the waves of walkers for the remainder of the day.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"
[
]


Margo attends a training session in Alexandria led by 
Aaron
 but watches 
Gage
 as he begins to taunt 
Lydia
 with a mask made out of a burlap sack when she approaches the group of soldiers. She laughs alongside 
Alfred
 and Gage before telling Lydia to go away. Later that day, she is eating lunch with Alfred and Gage inside the dining hall when Lydia sits at their table and guts a squirrel, in which blood shoots onto Gage's face. As Gage storms away, Alfred brings up 
Ozzy
 and 
Alek
's deaths to Margo and questions how they can be okay with Lydia living alongside them. Margo instead tells him not to cause trouble with everyone present.

That night, Margo and her friends ambush Lydia by the clotheslines and order her to leave Alexandria. When Lydia refuses, Margo proceeds to beat her and holds her to the ground, ordering Gage to attack her, reminding him of 
Addy
 and 
Rodney
's deaths. When 
Negan
 arrives to rescue Lydia, Margo is thrown off of the frightened girl into a wall, accidentally slamming her head against it and dying immediately of severe head trauma to the shock of a horrified Alfred. She is then examined by 
Siddiq
, who confirms the nature of her death. A short time later, Margo is buried in a grave.

Trivia
[
]


Margo shares similar storylines with 
Sherry
 and 
Morton
 in the Comic Series. Margo's death is similar to Sherry's death as they were accidentally killed during a physical altercation and Margo's anger and aggressive nature is similar to Morton's behavior as they both tried to attack someone out of frustration over the Whisperer conflict.


Margo is the first known member of the 
Coalition
 to die after the events of "
The Calm Before
".


She is the only named female member of the 
Highwaymen
.

She is also the only member of the Highwaymen to have been killed and not turned into a walker and is the only Highwaymen to not be killed by a 
Whisperer
.


In "
Silence the Whisperers
", actress Lindsey McCollough served as the stunt-double for Margo.
[1]


Lindsey McCollough also played a 
Savior
 in Season 6 and Season 7.


Margo appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".
