Overview
[
]


Patrick is an earnest, polite, and respectful young man. He generally gets along with the other kids and is quite well-mannered towards the adults, such as referring to 
Daryl Dixon
 as "sir" and "mister". He has a youthful innocence to him, at one point shown to be playing with LEGOs and admitting to not be ashamed despite the toys being for ages 4-12. One day, Patrick starts to feel sick and later dies of an unknown flu. He reanimates and attacks the cellblock, causing chaos to unfold. Everyone is shown to be saddened by his death, with 
Rick
 mentioning how he was a good kid.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Patrick's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Sometime within the month after the assault from 
Woodbury
, Patrick joined the prison community.



Season 4
[
]


"
30 Days Without An Accident
"
[
]


Patrick is seen at the outdoor kitchen and is asked by 
Carol Peletier
 to watch over the cooking as she speaks to 
Daryl Dixon
. Patrick thanks Daryl for the deer he brought to camp the previous week and requests to shake his hand, which Daryl allows, but not before licking his fingers. Later, Patrick is seen hanging out with Carl and the other kids near the fence. He attends storytime led by Carol, but asks to be excused due to feeling sick, and Carol allows him to leave.

That night, Patrick is visibly sick with a cough. He heads to the shower room, covered head to toe in sweat, and leaving sweaty footprints in his wake. He turns on the water, and, not long after, he drops to the floor and dies from an unknown flu. He later reanimates.

Infected
"
[
]


Karen
 enters the shower room and hears a noise. She opens one of the shower curtains but does not see anything. As she walks away towards Cell Block D, where many of the prison residents are sleeping, a zombified Patrick gets up from the shower room floor. He finds his way to Cell Block D and enters a cell where a 
man
 is sleeping. Patrick bites his victim in the throat before tearing into his stomach, killing the man until he soon reanimates. From there, they stumble into other open cells and attack their victims. As it becomes morning, chaos breaks out in Cell Block D as sleeping residents are awakened by screams and bloody corpses. As survivors in their pajamas flee the massacre, Rick and several others arrive to help. A zombified Patrick attacks Glenn but is put down by Daryl who soon realizes who he just put down. After the attack, the 
Prison Council
 discusses what happened and Carol mentions that Patrick was healthy the day before, deducing that the illness must affect the host very quickly. In the prison yard, Rick comforts Carl, who had been friends with Patrick, by saying that Patrick was a good kid.



"

Patrick and the other deceased residents from the attack are buried in the prison yard, with his glasses placed on his tombstone.
