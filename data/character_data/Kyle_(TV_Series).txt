He also handles the breakdown of the food supply in Alexandria, prioritizing the children and elderly, followed by those on recon and guard duty, and finally the general population. 

He is among the residents to gather at the front gate when Judith and the others return with the newcomers. Later, he joins the rest of the council as they interview 
Magna

Kyle is at the dining hall enjoying a meal when Lydia makes a scene by gutting a dead squirrel, upsetting

Alfred

Later that night, Kyle and the council reunite in the meeting house to discuss Lydia's attack. They question Gage and Alfred, who lie and say they were attacked. Gabriel asks why Lydia's the one in the infirmary. They remind the council that their friends were beheaded by the Whisperers and now Margo is dead, and they are not happy with how they are being treated. The council then lets them go.

While the council discusses their vote on Negan's fate, Kyle opposes to Negan being spared after explaining his own motives. Daryl arrives and says he believes Lydia, which ties the vote. Gabriel announces he'll take the night to make his decision by tomorrow.

Hilltop woman
.



"
A Certain Doom

Though unseen, Kyle and dozens of others seek refuge on the upper floors of the hospital.

Trivia
[
]


Originally, Kyle was meant to be killed off during "
Monsters
" but they used 
another core extra
 instead as the featured casualty.


Due to being one of the recurring core extras, 
Kyle
 was named and was selected to play the role of a councilman for the Alexandria council.


Deleted scenes from "
Guardians
" included Michonne calling out Kyle's name to get his attention before he could leave the meeting house.


Kyle appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Variant
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Kyle appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".

Actor Marvin Lee was not brought back to film for Season 11, along with a number of other background cast, likely due to the restructuring and streamlining of the production process as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The actor confirmed his character was not killed off in "
A Certain Doom
" and returned to Alexandria at the end of the Whisperer War.
