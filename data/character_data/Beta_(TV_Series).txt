Overview


Beta is shown to be a brutal, sociopathic, cunning, aggressive, and highly analytical man who is devoted to the Whisperer way of life. Prior to his time with the Whisperers however, Beta was revealed to be a solitary, socially awkward, and mentally unstable individual, having apparently turned into a recluse and gone insane after his 
best friend
 died. He is shown to be extremely protective of his identity to the point that he even murders a fellow 
Whisperer
 for recognizing him from his days as a celebrity before the apocalypse. This shows that Beta, like Alpha and a majority of the Whisperers, has completely shed the identity and life he once had and has adapted fully to the post-apocalyptic hell. He somewhat appears to hate the person he once was and desperately wants to escape his past though it also seems, in a way, that he wants to preserve his image as the inspiring musician he once was.    

He is completely loyal to his leader, Alpha, following her orders without question and respecting her decisions completely and looking up to her. However despite his loyalty to Alpha, Beta is far from being a complete yes-man, and will occasionally voice any disagreements he has with her, even though he will usually do as commanded, regardless of his opinion on the subject. 

Due to his large size and strength, Beta is a very dangerous opponent, capable of using excessive force to protect his group and is an extremely skilled fighter, being able to casually overpower 
Daryl
 during a fight and later 
Rosita
. He has very fast reflexes, as he effortlessly grabbed Henry's stick when the latter tried to hit him. He is also extremely durable, shrugging off a stab wound and even surviving a more than two-story fall down an elevator shaft after being tricked and shoved in by Daryl. Beta is shown to be quite capable of cold-blooded murder and was fully prepared to kill both 
Henry
 and 
Lydia
 on Alpha's orders, showing that he has no qualms about harming adolescents and nearly even broke Henry's arm. He appears to be a highly skilled tracker and strategic thinker as well which makes him a vital member of the Whisperers; with Lydia admitting to Daryl that he is the group's best. His strong strategic and combat abilities were demonstrated by his lone 
attack
 on Alexandria in which he was able to infiltrate undetected and slaughter numerous residents himself. Beta's final defeat only came when he was focused solely on killing Negan in revenge and so let his guard down to outside attack by Daryl. Even so, he was able to survive being stabbed through both eyes and showed little sign of feeling pain as his end came.

He is more than willing to harm any Whisperer who poses a threat to Alpha and to keep the others in line, as he threatened fellow Whisperer 
Sean
 upon learning of his and 
Helen
's disdain for Alpha's decisions and applauded Alpha for murdering them to remind the other Whisperers of her dominance. This shows that he will do whatever is necessary to preserve Alpha's leadership over their "pack". Despite this, he does show respect for members who are committed to the Whisperer way of life as seen by him consoling a dying fellow 
Whisperer
 who wishes to reanimate as a walker upon death. While Beta has no problem with killing, he doesn't seem to enjoy it under unnecessary circumstances either, as he openly expresses disdain towards Daryl for not handing over Lydia when he was after her, claiming no one else from his group had to be 
slaughtered
 as a result. This is further reinforced during his infiltration of Alexandria, as while he does remorselessly kill several residents to create a distraction, he was also willing to spare 
Laura
, initially only disarming and knocking her down so he could pursue 
Mary
, although he still killed her after she attacked him once more. 

Following Alpha's assassination by Negan, Beta is shown to be utterly devastated and filled with rage and even appears to have a mental breakdown. Upon hearing a fellow 
Whisperer
 proclaim him as the "new Alpha", Beta punishes him by having Alpha's reanimated head bite his ear off, showing that he refuses to replace Alpha and still accepts her as his leader even though she is dead, showing his respect, loyalty and admiration of Alpha. To honor her, he even adds a piece of her face to his mask, showing that she was one of the people he admired most in life, alongside his best friend. However, in the 
following episode
, Beta's mental breakdown worsens as Beta begins to hear voices in his head, and hallucinates having walkers speak to him, and it's subtly hinted that Beta's refusal to take the mantle of "Alpha" is due to an inferiority complex, as the voices urge him to have faith in his own strength.

In his final moments after being mortally wounded by Daryl, Beta is shown to be completely accepting of his defeat and death. Before meeting his demise, he remembers his time as a Whisperer and also of Alpha, showing his desire to be reunited with his beloved leader in death. He dies a sociopathic, remorseless mass murderer and fanatical, loyal follower of Alpha fully submitted to the barbarianism and savageness of the Whisperers and overall the polar opposite of the person he once was.



Pre-Apocalypse


Maryland


Prior to the outbreak, Beta was a professional and famous country musician known as "Half Moon". For unknown reasons, he visited a rehabilitation center, and became close friends with his 
rehab counsellor
 while there.

At some point shortly before the outbreak, he killed a home invader and felt remorse after seeing that the invader had a "Half Moon" T-shirt on.



Post-Apocalypse


At some point after the outbreak, Beta and his best friend took refuge in a survivor camp though it was eventually overrun by walkers, forcing the two to take refuge in an abandoned hospital. The friend was later bitten, and shortly thereafter died and reanimated, driving Beta to insanity. He could not bring himself to put his friend down and let him roam the hospital as a walker. Beta also decided to wear a ski mask to hide his identity from strangers to preserve his image as an inspiring musician before the apocalypse while descending into a ruthless killer to stay alive.

Sometime later, 
Dee
 and her daughter 
Lydia
 arrived at the hospital to escape from walkers. Beta reluctantly allowed them to stay one night but forbade them from entering his private quarters. He eventually formed a bond with Dee due to them sharing similar views about the new world though after she tried to see his face, he demanded her and her daughter to leave. Lydia however eventually trespassed on his side of the hospital, forcing her mother to follow her and ended up killing Beta's zombified best friend, to his fury. Dee calmed him down and welcomed him to join them. Beta refused to leave his best friend behind and Dee convinced him to skin his face off and wear it to continue hiding his identity (to which she and Lydia learned). Beta accepted and also took his friend's shirt. 

After meeting Beta, Dee killed 
Hera
, the leader of a large group of survivors that would eventually become known as the "
Whisperers
". The two took over the Whisperers with Beta as the group's second-in-command, while Dee took the name of "Alpha" and became the leader. Under their direction, they instructed their people to skin walkers and wear their skin in order to mask their scents and move freely among herds. This was also used as a method to attack other survivor camps and settlements. The group members were also demanded to abandon their previous lives and beliefs and become nothing but hardened, primitive survivors. They survived off the land by moving from place to place. Beta continued to protect his identity strictly and always wears his mask, even in the safety of their camp.

Guardians
"


In the woods, Beta grabs a sneaking 
Henry
 and tosses him in front of 
Alpha
. He says he's been tracking Henry for a while, but Henry's been tracking them for longer. Alpha questions him as Beta threatens to break his arm. Henry relents and reveals he came alone to get 
Lydia
. She calls him stupid and punches him in the face. Alpha decides Henry's coming with them. A while later, they arrive at the Whisperers' camp. Alpha instructs Beta to tie Henry to a tree and to get Lydia a new mask.

Later, Beta skins a walker head to use for Lydia's mask when Alpha is challenged by a couple of Whisperers for her leadership role. Beta grabs Sean from behind and holds a long knife to his throat. 
"You're changing the rules again,"
 he says calmly. Beta then watches in silent as Alpha brutally executes 
Sean
 and 
Helen
.

In her tent, Beta unmasks Alpha and listens as she tells him about the time before the apocalypse when she hit Lydia hard for almost suffocating in a dry-cleaning bag. She tells him that people do whatever it takes to protect those they love. 
"We need to be ready when they come for the boy,"
 Beta says. They both agree Henry can be useful and they need to find out if Lydia truly has feelings for him.

At night, Beta takes Henry to Alpha. She makes Lydia pick up a knife and tells her to kill Henry with it to prove what side she's on. Lydia begins to cry as she approaches Henry. Alpha warns her not to be weak like her father and that if she doesn't kill him, Beta will kill them both. Suddenly, a small herd of walkers show up and begin eating the unmasked Whisperers as chaos unfolds in the camp.



"
Chokepoint
"


At the Whisperer camp, Beta consoles a 
dying Whisperer
 and then tells a tracker to find Lydia or else 
"they'll all walk with the guardians."
 He then takes a group of Whisperers with him to go look for Lydia on Alpha's orders.

At dawn, Beta walks down the road with a group of walkers and Whisperers into the area of the building where the others are hiding Lydia. He quietly instructs his people to spread out as 
Daryl
 shoots the Whisperer who had turned with his crossbow. Beta and his people break in and quickly discover a trap meant to separate them from the dead. He and the Whisperers then creep upstairs.

Beta busts down the main door, using another door as a shield, to attack Daryl. The two size each other up and Beta forces Daryl's neck towards a blade, but he manages to punch him and break free. Beta returns with a punch of his own and Daryl stabs him in the chest before escaping into the trap door. Beta grabs the knife out of his chest and announces all he wants is Lydia. Daryl sneaks up through the crawl space behind him and pushes him down the elevator shaft.

Later, as Daryl and the others leave the building, at the bottom of the elevator shaft, Beta rises in pain. He peers up, enraged, covered in blood, and with his bottom front teeth knocked out.



"
The Calm Before
"


Beta observes from the woods as a large group of Whisperers ambush Daryl, 
Michonne
, 
Carol
, and 
Yumiko
. that night. He emerges from the trees and tells them to drop their weapons. 
"You just had to give me the girl,"
 he growls at Daryl, telling him their deal is off. Beta then orders the Whisperers to tie them up.

Later, Alpha approaches the group and tells them she ran into trouble on the road as she wipes her bloody knife on her pants. Michonne warns her if she tries to get Lydia back they'll respond in force, but Alpha assures her Lydia isn't her concern anymore, leaving Beta shocked. She takes out a shotgun and orders Daryl to follow her.

The next day, Beta asks Alpha about Lydia upon her return back to the camp. 
"I want to be alone,"
 Alpha orders him as she weeps. He obeys and walks away.



"
The Storm
"


Sometime following their attack on the communities, Beta and the rest of the Whisperers move to a warmer state to avoid the harsh winter during the next months. In their camp, Beta tells Alpha 
"the time away has been good for the pack."
 Alpha reminds him she'll need to be strong for what comes next and Beta assures her she will be. He then flogs her arm with a branch to make her strong.

"
We Are the End of the World
"


In the past, a masked Beta lives inside an abandoned hospital after his camp was overrun. He also keeps his zombified 
best friend
 locked in a room, unable to put him down. Sometime later, he watches as a 
woman
 and her 
daughter
 run inside to escape from the dead. 

In the present, Beta and Alpha discuss their enemies and the fear they possess on them. He says they should return so they won't forget about them, but Alpha questions his loyalty towards her decisions. Beta says he would never question her and is sent to collect walkers for their herd with the help of 
two
 
sisters
.

Back in the past, Dee explains to Beta that she and her daughter don't mean harm. He allows them to stay for the night. In the present, Beta lures walkers from a gallery. In the past, Beta explains to Dee that he doesn't want to hear her singing and that the sound of the dead is the only sound he never wants to end.

In the present, Frances starts crying in the middle of a herd, attracting the attention of the walkers. Beta kills them and says she will pay for this. At their camp, Beta throws Frances to the ground and orders a Whisperer to kill her. As she starts screaming that her son is in a better place, Alpha demands they leave her alone. Beta follows her and says she needs to punish Frances. Alpha angrily tells him to not question her and claims he would never understand how it feels to lose a child. She then orders him to send Frances to a tent where she will be waiting.

In the past, Beta helps Dee kill some walkers on the hospital hallways. Afterward, he helps Dee open the walkers' carcasses so she can use the blood later on. She jokingly decides to call him "B" and claims that makes her the "A". When she tries to see his face under the mask, he demands she leave at sunrise and not come back.

Back in the present at the next day, Beta follows Alpha as she leads a group of Whisperers to a field to gather more walkers. Suddenly, a satellite crashes through the sky and the herd starts to scatter. When Beta witnesses Frances attacking Alpha, he runs to help only to watch as she is saved by Frances' sister. 

At their camp, Beta listens nearby as Alpha praises Frances' sister on her loyalty. He approaches and questions Alpha about why she is calm after losing three of their people and their herd. Alpha, however, claims she is proud of the woman. That night, Alpha anoints the woman a "Gamma" and the group praises her as Beta watches with jealousy from behind. The next day, Gamma questions Beta's feelings about her. They both claim to be empty as Alpha wants. Beta then heads off to look for Alpha at their old camp.

In the past, Beta finds Dee wandering in his room and is mad at her for ignoring his previous warnings. She then kills his zombified best friend after it comes out of another room. Beta loses it and starts wrecking the place. Lydia arrives and ultimately stops him from killing Dee. He kneels by his friend's side as Dee approaches him and declares "We are the end of the world." She lifts his mask to look at his face and chuckles, seemingly recognizing him. Beta doesn't want to leave his friend behind and she declares he won't have to, giving him a knife so he can peel his friend's face off.

In the present, Beta discovers Alpha has made a shrine to Lydia and lied about killing her. Alpha breaks down and says she couldn't kill her daughter. She then destroys the shrine and pleads with him to keep Lydia's life a secret. He promises he will and informs her that the enemy has crossed the border. Alpha smiles and says they will return to teach them a lesson. Later, Beta and the Whisperers move around the woods with their herd towards the border.



"
What It Always Is
"


Beta is skinning a new mask when Gamma returns from her mission to talk with Alpha. He looks unpleasant at her and continues doing his task. When a 
Whisperer
 defies Alpha's strategies, Beta tries to kill him but is stopped by Alpha. She then cuts the Whisperer on his arm and leg and hands the knife to Beta. He approaches the injured Whisperer and slashes him on the back of his neck.

That night, Beta and a group of Whisperers arrive at one of their borders after hearing the yells of 
Negan
. He confronts and throws him to the ground before he can keep killing their walkers. 
"Alright, you big ass freak, let's do this,"
 Negan says defiantly to Beta as he smiles.



"
Bonds
"


Beta and the Whisperers escort a blindfolded Negan through the woods after capturing him. When he keeps talking and making jokes, Beta puts his knives to Negan's throat and demands that he is too loud. Negan apologizes and introduces himself, before explaining he has been a prisoner of Alexandria for eight years and is willing to reveal their secrets. Beta relents and gags Negan as they continue their walk towards their camp.

Upon arriving at their camp, Beta argues with Alpha that Negan should be killed because he doesn't belong with them. Alpha notes that Beta has been questioning her rather often lately and asks if he is finally challenging her. Beta kneels in submission and vows that he will never challenge her. Alpha forgives him and then Beta takes Negan to another part of the woods. While walking, Negan mocks Beta's relationship with Alpha and jokes that he is attracted by her baldness. 

Later that day, Beta forces Negan to do a series of tasks, like digging graves, skinning walkers, and help hunt a boar to prove his worthiness. That night, Beta tells Negan that he has not earned the right to eat with them and throws him to the ground. He then notices in anger as another 
Whisperer
 shares some of his food with Negan.  

A while later, Beta takes Negan to walk among one of their herds in the woods as his final task. When Negan starts making jokes again, Beta tells him he'll never be one of them because he's too loud and egotistical. 
"I'm not here for you, I'm here for Alpha,"
 Negan says. Beta kills a Whisperer in response and walks away, leaving Negan to fend for himself with a pocket knife. 

The next morning, Beta returns to the camp and tells Alpha that Negan died because he was weak but is suddenly left in shock when a blood-covered Negan arrives back and kneels in front of Alpha to introduce himself. He then watches as Alpha leans down to sniff him and accepts him into the group.



"
Squeeze
"


Beta is informed by Alpha that their enemy has crossed the border and they were heading to the National Park where the horde was located. He says they've underestimated them so Alpha assumes that they've sent spies beyond the border and assigns more guards, before sending Gamma to carry a message to their spy in Alexandria. 

Sometime later that day, Beta notices Gamma didn't make it to the border and sends four scouts to help her in case she gets caught by the traitor. The next day, Alpha eventually asks him about Gamma's whereabouts and implies to him that Gamma is the traitor. She orders him to track her down and bring her to the camp. Beta angrily states that he will kill her if she's the spy, but Alpha tells him not to, aiming to do it herself in front of the whole pack.



"
Stalker
"


Beta walks through a field in the forest and enters into a moldy RV where two other Whisperers open a latch revealing a deep pathway entrance to a tunnel. He jumps down, lights a lantern and starts to move forward deeper in the cave and eventually into a tunnel system. That night, Beta crawls out from a grave and unsheathes his double blades before walking stealthily through 
Alexandria
 to retrieve Gamma. Shortly after, he slaughters several Alexandrians in their houses and then sits down to meditate as he waits for his victims to reanimate to serve as a distraction.

When his victims reanimate and the Alexandrians are forced to deal with the undead, Beta kills the guard stationed outside the building, enters the basement and opens the cell as 
Mary
 claims that Alpha lied about Alexandria. He ignores her and tells her to go with him without hesitation, so her death will be painless. She moves forward and states she's not afraid of him as 
Laura
 appears from behind and threatens Beta with an ax, telling Mary to get help. Beta immediately knocks the ax away and starts to leave when Laura jumps on him to prevent him from leaving. However, he overpowers her and slams her back against the cell door twice, killing her.  

Beta comes out on the street and enters a house to investigate. He tries to enter the children's room, only to get shot in the chest by 
Judith
 and fall hard on the floor. When Mary tries to follow Judith and R.J. outside, Beta grabs her foot and knocks her down. He then checks his bulletproof vest before 
Rosita
 draws his attention. They battle with their weapons until Beta slashes both of her arms and gets her on the ground. Before he can kill her, Mary tells him to stop or she'll kill herself, saying she knows Alpha wants her alive. Shortly after, Beta escorts Mary back to the camp when they are ambushed by the Alexandrians, forcing him to flee into the woods.



"
Morning Star
"


In the woods, Beta uses his knives to remove the bark from the nearby trees in order to extract sap, which is being harvested by the Whisperers. Later, the Whisperers march with their horde. Beta chants "We are the end of the world", and the other Whisperers follow. Alpha continues the chant by saying "We take them all".

Later the horde makes it way to 
Hilltop
. Behind the herd, Beta commands the Whisperers to launch the sap they collected earlier using makeshift catapults into the front lines, drenching most of the defenders as well as the Hilltop's walls. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltoper ablaze. With no choice, the defenders begin to retreat towards the Hilltop, but are trapped when the Whisperers launch another volley of fire-arrows into the Hilltop's walls, setting the community ablaze.



"
Walk With Us
"


In the aftermath of the battle, Beta searches for survivors to stab in the hearts to join Alpha's herd. Alpha chastises Negan for destroying the survivor's brain instead of stabbing him in the heart. She then laments all the walkers they lost. Negan thinks they should savor the victory, but Alpha does not share his sentiment, since she doesn't have everything she wants. Negan quickly deduces this to be Lydia and inquires, but Beta dismisses him, and vows to Alpha that he will find Lydia and bring her back. When Alpha turns to leave, Negan attempts to follow her, but Beta blocks his path and orders him to gather the scattered walkers.

A while later, Beta locates 
Mary
, 
Alden
, 
Kelly
, and 
Adam
, sending a small cluster of walkers at them. They run off, find an abandoned car and hide in it to avoid the walkers but Mary decides to lure the walkers away from Adam and the rest. In a clearing, Mary kills the walkers but after she's done, she is abruptly stabbed in the stomach by Beta, who reaffirms that she will walk with the Whisperers again. Mary tries to fight back and, in her struggle, rips a part of Beta's mask off. This prompts him to finish her off by disemboweling her. Another 
Whisperer
 shows up and recognizes Beta from before the apocalypse, noting that his voice sounded familiar. Beta slits the Whisperer's throat to protect his real identity. He then patiently waits for Mary to reanimate. As soon as she does, however, she is killed with an arrow shot by Alden. Beta runs off before Alden can shoot him as well.



"
Look at the Flowers
"


At the pike border, Beta and two other Whisperers discover Alpha's reanimated head. One of the Whisperers, 
Rufus
, deduces that Negan killed her, and notes that this makes Beta the "Alpha" now. Enraged by his remark, Beta claims that Alpha can still hear him, before commanding Rufus to take off his mask. When the latter does so, Beta asks if Rufus can hear Alpha and what she is saying to him. When the unfortunate Whisperer fails to answer, Beta shoves him closer to Alpha. He continues doing so until Alpha bites Rufus, as the other Whisperer flees in terror. After finally relenting, Beta takes Alpha's head off the pike and takes her with him.

Elsewhere, Beta and Rufus are walking to an undisclosed location. Reeling from his infection, Rufus coughs, which attracts a nearby walker. Beta stands between Rufus and the walker in an attempt to shield his companion, but when the walker shows no signs of turning away, Rufus gets nervous and prepares to kill the undead assailant. Before he can, however, he is stabbed in the back by Beta, who then lets Rufus be devoured. Listening to what "Alpha" is telling him, Beta ventures inside a hotel. Upon entering, he finds a bar with a couple of dead survivors, musical instruments, and a note on the table saying "These 2 eyes see 1 truth". Upon further inspection, he sees his face on a poster promoting "Half Moon", the country singer. Confronted by his past identity, Beta is horrified, and takes out his frustrations on a nearby guitar, smashing it.

At the abandoned hotel, Beta inspects a recording of one of his concerts. After some pondering, he puts it inside the record player. The music attracts the nearby walkers. From the hotel balcony, Beta observes the herd that has now gathered because of his music. He tearfully rips off the part of his mask that Mary had damaged earlier.  Beta reads the note he picked up earlier again. He then takes Alpha's head out of the sack and thanks her, saying that he "finally sees now". With that, he finally puts Alpha down. With the amassed walkers still trying to get inside, Beta opens the door and enters the herd. Having repaired his mask once more with a piece of Alpha's face, Beta leads the herd forward.



"
The Tower
"


Beta and the Whisperers have finally brought the horde to 
Alexandria
, but find it seemingly empty. Meanwhile, as the horde is rampaging through Alexandria, Beta observes from the base of the windmill. While discussing their next move with the other Whisperers, Beta hears a voice in his head mocking the survivors. He informs the other Whisperers they will continue towards Oceanside. Unbeknownst to him, he is being watched from the upper floor of the windmill by Alden, who communicates information to Aaron via sign language. Beta nearly spots Alden, but ultimately decides to move on. 

Beta is seen leading the horde towards 
Oceanside
, but suddenly stops as he senses that something is wrong. He complains that the survivors are not fools, and begins to suspect that they are being led into a trap. 
Another Whisperer
 tries to reassure Beta, but in doing so, accidentally calls him "Alpha". Despite her remorse, Beta prepares to kill the Whisperer, but is halted by the voice in his head. Beta asks the voice to show him the path, but it urges him to be patient and have faith in his strength. With that, Beta continues forward with the horde.

At the helm of the horde, Beta talks to himself and continues to hear the voice in his head. Just then, he spots a cat crossing the road. The voice now manifests itself into a walker marching next to Beta, who tells him that faith will be rewarded. Beta deviously chuckles. Beta has finally reached the Tower with the horde. He begins to chant, and hallucinates the walkers doing so, too.



"
A Certain Doom
"


With 
the hospital
 surrounded, Beta hallucinates the horde telling him that they are ready and all turning to face him and chanting. Beta orders them to begin and the horde along with 
the Whisperers
 begins their attack on the hospital.

Shortly thereafter, a group led by 
Daryl Dixon
 makes their way through the horde covered in walker guts and covered by the others from inside the hospital. Noticing this, Beta is told by a walker to turn the horde which he does, giving the archers a harder target. Shortly thereafter, a walker informs Beta that the end is almost there just before loud music begins drawing the horde away from the hospital and the walker adds that its 
"our end."
 Beta and the other Whisperers begin following the music with the horde.

That night, the Whisperers attack the wagon, destroying it and the sound system despite the 
Coalition
's best efforts. With Beta and the Whisperers turning the horde back around, Daryl's group infiltrates the horde and starts assassinating the Whisperers one by one. A walker draws Beta's attention to 
Lydia
 who begins turning the horde again, but as Beta goes to follow her, he is confronted by 
Negan Smith
. Enraged over the loss of 
Alpha
, Beta throws a walker at Negan, knocking him to the ground, and prepares to kill the former Savior leader in revenge. At that moment, Daryl attacks, slashing Beta and then stabbing him through both eyes.

Mortally wounded, Beta imagines himself pulling 
the knives
 out and being embraced by the walkers while reminiscing on his life as a Whisperer. In reality, the herd moves in and begins to devour Beta, who is unfazed and smiling happily as the herd rip into him. As Beta is devoured, his mask gets ripped off, and Negan is shocked to recognize him, although Daryl doesn't care, simply stating that Beta was "
nobody."

Season 10


Trivia


Beta is the third major recurring secondary 
antagonist
 in the 
TV Series
, with the first being 
Merle Dixon
, the second being 
Simon
, and the fourth being 
Leah Shaw
.

Beta is currently the only major recurring secondary antagonist whose real name is not known.


Additionally, he is the second main character to be a secondary antagonist for more than half a season, with Simon being the first.


Beta is currently the only major recurring secondary antagonist that did not die before the major recurring primary antagonist.


The term "Beta" denotes the second most dominant role or position in a particular sphere or group.

Even though Beta refuses to accept the position of the alpha after 
Alpha
's death, he still becomes the de-facto leader of the Whisperers.


Just like his comic book counterpart, Beta's signature weapon is a pair of large knives. A holster for these knives can be seen on his belt.


Additionally like his comic counterpart, Negan nicknames Beta "Frowny Mctwoknives" due to the latter wielding two large knives.

Negan has also given him the nickname of "the Jolly Green Giant".


Like his comic counterpart, Beta doesn't allow anyone to see his face by always wearing a mask. He is so protective with his identity that he will even kill people if they find out.

Only nine people are known to have seen his face; 
Alpha
, 
Lydia
, 
Mary
, his 
best friend
, a 
Whisperer
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Lucille Smith
, and 
Daryl Dixon
. 
Daniel Salazar
, 
Grace Mukherjee
, and 
Dennis Graham
 also saw his face due to it being on an album cover, albeit unknowingly.


Negan Smith, Lucille Smith, Daniel Salazar, and Dennis Graham were fans of his. Dee, Daryl Dixon, and the Whisperer he killed were also familiar with who he once was.


Beta demonstrates a strong physical endurance and an extremely high tolerance for pain.

He displayed no signs of pain when he was stabbed in the chest with a shiv by 
Daryl
 and he quickly removes the shiv from his chest without any resistance.


He survives and stands back up after getting pushed down an elevator shaft by Daryl.


He is shot in the chest by 
Judith
 with 
Rick
's 
Colt Python
, but survives thanks to the armor he stole from a 
guard
 he killed earlier and is able to get up and resume fighting moments later, despite initially appearing dead/unconscious.


He is slashed in the gut with 
Rosita
's 
macuahitl
 while fighting her, yet is only momentarily affected by his injury and is still able to overpower her.


He is slashed under his arm and then has both of his eyes stabbed out by Daryl. However, it doesn't seem to affect him at all.


He showed no sign of pain as walkers were surrounding and tearing him apart. Instead, he smiled at the fact that it was happening. However, this can be chalked up to his diluted mental state right before he died.


Beta appears to be missing several teeth, which he has replaced with metal dental prosthetics.

He is the second known person in 
The Walking Dead
 franchise to wear dentures, the first being 
Martha Brown
.


Ryan Hurst hinted on 
Talking Dead
 that he may or may not have been a celebrity before the apocalypse, similar to his comic book counterpart who was a basketball player and actor. Indeed, it was confirmed that Beta was a musician.

Also on 
Talking Dead
, Ryan Hurst revealed that he came up with the idea to make Beta a singer.

It is later revealed in "
Look at the Flowers
" that his stage name was "Half Moon".


Angela Kang
 also revealed that "Half Moon" was also one of Beta's album names.


This makes him one of five main characters in the TV Series to be recognized with a relative "celebrity" status prior to the apocalypse. The other four are 
Tyreese Williams
 who was a former 
NFL
 linebacker, 
Deanna Monroe
 who was a congresswoman from Ohio, 
Connie
 who was a journalist and was known to have uncovered a huge corruption scandal, and 
Pamela Milton
 who was an influential politician.


In 
Fear the Walking Dead
, 
Dante Esquivel
, 
Jim Brauer
, 
Mickey
 and her husband 
Cliff
 also have the "celebrity" status.


Beta wears his 
best friend
's face as his walker mask and his shirt.

After putting Alpha's zombified head down, Beta adds a piece of her face to his mask.


Beta is one of the few known characters to have killed a person before the apocalypse took place.


Beta is one of three characters to have lost both of his eyes, the others being 
Terry
 and 
Berto
.

He is the only one of these characters to have lost both of their eyes while still alive.


This also makes him them first, and so far only character in the franchise to be completely blind.


His death is similar to that of 
Jeremiah Garlitz
 and 
Ed
; he dies by being happily eaten alive by his "followers" in a Christ-like pose.


In "
Here's Negan
", Lucille can be spotted wearing a band T-shirt with Half Moon's face on it.


"Beta" appears on album covers in 
Fear the Walking Dead
 and 
World Beyond
.


"Beta" is the seventh main character to predecease his comic counterpart, with the first being 
Dale Horvath
, the second being 
Lori Grimes
, the third being 
Andrea Harrison
, the fourth being 
Carl Grimes
, and the fifth being 
Jesus
, and the sixth being 
Siddiq
.


Beta is the last 
Whisperer
 to die in the TV Series.


Beta appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.
