I'm sorry for -- for

. I-I mean, I didn't want to get you in trouble, but I just caused 
more trouble.

Overview
[
]


Adeline is a sweet and kind-hearted girl, who in contrast to her friends, 
Gage
 and 
Rodney
, is shown to be more mature and sensible. Though she goes along with sneaking out and getting drunk with them, she is disgusted when they play with a walker and wants no part in it. She develops a crush on 
Henry
 and tries to flirt with him on many occasions, though these attempts generally don't work since Henry has feelings for Lydia. She greatly cares for Henry's well-being, such as telling 
Daryl
 about how he went after 
Lydia
. In her final moments, she shows bravery and courage by fighting back against the 
Whisperers
 in a last stand.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Addy's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Adeline joined a community called the 
Hilltop Colony
 where she lived for half her life.



Season 9
[
]


"
Stradivarius
"
[
]


Outside the Hilltop's walls, Addy practices defense moves with 
Gage
 as part of her training to become a member of the Hilltop's guard under 
Kal
's instruction and supervision.



"
Evolution
"
[
]


Upon noticing a solitary 
Henry
 eating away from the other residents, Addy and her friends call him to talk with them. She tries to flirt with him and shortly after, they invite him to hang with them in the woods. 

That night, Henry drinks with his new friends in a shed outside of Hilltop. Gage suggests they have some more fun and takes them to a covered hole in the ground with a 
walker
 inside. However, Addy leaves as they throw rope rings at it and Rodney pees on it.



"
Bounty
"
[
]


When Alpha arrives outside the gates with a group of 
the Whisperers
 to offer trading Alden and Luke for her captive daughter, Addy helps search the town for Henry and 
Lydia
, who have gone missing. She approaches 
Enid
 and informs her that she thinks she knows where Henry ran off to. 

Upon arriving at the cabin hideout, Addy watches on as Enid attempts to convince Henry that they must return Lydia to the Whisperers, for the safety of Alden and 
Luke
. After Henry agrees, Addy returns with Henry, Enid, and Lydia to Hilltop. At night, she approaches 
Daryl
 and gives him a letter left behind by Henry, indicating that he went after Lydia.



"
Chokepoint
"
[
]


Addy is part of 
Tara
's group in charge of clearing a tree from their path to 
the Kingdom
 to ensure the roads are cleared for 
Alden
's convoy carrying the food and trade goods for the fair. Upon finding a downed tree, Addy remains alert and checks the surrounding area. She keeps on watch as the others help chop the tree into pieces to clear the road.

Later that day, a small 
herd
 of walkers approaches the group. They get in position and remind themselves to watch for the Whisperers. When Gage is attacked by a walker, Addy rushes in and saves him. Suddenly, 
the Highwaymen
 ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara after helping to take down the herd. They then escort them to the Kingdom, having accepted 
Carol
's deal. Upon arriving at the Kingdom, Addy excitedly looks around with Gage and Rodney.



"
The Calm Before
"
[
]


Addy watches from the crowd as 
Ezekiel
 declares they've finally accomplished 
Rick
, 
Carl
, and 
Jesus
' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. While at the fair, Addy talks with Henry and apologizes for ratting him out earlier, although he claims they are on good terms. 

At some point later that day, Addy is somehow among the residents kidnapped by Alpha and taken away to a barn in the woods where they are about to be attacked by the Whisperers but are found by 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and 
D.J.
, giving the group a chance to fight back. During the fight, Addy and Frankie take down a Whisperer. In the middle of the chaos, 
Alpha
 arrives and the group is subdued. She then decapitates everyone as 
Siddiq
 is forced to watch, only leaving him alive as a witness. Addy's decapitated head is later put by Alpha on one of the several pikes used for the Whisperers' border.

The next day, Daryl, 
Michonne
, Carol, Siddiq, and 
Yumiko
 find the border and watch in horror at the victims, a reanimated Addy being among them. They then put down their zombified heads to properly rest. When the group returns to the Kingdom, Siddiq delivers the tragic news and narrates how Addy and the others fought together as a family in their last moments. He finishes the story by encouraging everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.

Trivia
[
]


While Addy was not introduced until 
Season 9
, her character was present for all of 
All Out War
. Furthermore, she has been at 
Hilltop
 from seemingly its inception as she states that she's lived there for almost half her life.


Addy's death is referenced in "
Silence the Whisperers
" when Margo pressures Gage to attack Lydia.


Addy appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
A New Deal
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


The two children who witness Gregory's hanging in "
A New Beginning
" strongly resemble younger versions of Addy and 
Rodney
. Whether or not this is them has yet to be confirmed.
