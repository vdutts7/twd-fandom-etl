,,,"Gorman is a manipulative, cunning, cruel, perverted, and sadistic man, and is among the most abusive Hospital residents. He is shown to be a rapist, sexually abusing Joan and attempting to blackmail Beth when he catches her in Dawn 's office. At one point, he finds Beth's lollipop which he puts in his mouth, only for him to force it into Beth's which he is shown to take twisted joy out of. Gorman's actions later lead to Joan's suicide, who didn't want to deal with his abuse any longer. Gorman is shown to use his status as a cop for his own personal gain, such as telling Beth she ought to be nicer to him since he was the one who rescued her and later trying to blackmail Beth after catching her in Dawn's office. He also seems to be highly disliked by many of his colleagues, such as Steven Edwards and Dawn herself. It's implies that Gorman wants to kill Dawn so he can take over and be free to do whatever he wants. Like many of the cops at the hospital, he may have once been a good person, seeing as he was a cop before the outbreak and even got an award. However, after the outbreak began, since there was no more law and Dawn mostly let him and the other cops do as they please, Gorman took the opportunity to do whatever he wanted. His rape victims tend to be people he believes are weaker than he is, such as him telling Beth that ""she's not a fighter."" Ironically right after he says this, Beth knocks him down by bashing him in the head with a lollipop jar and is devoured by a reanimated Joan, meeting a karmic end to two of the people he sexually abused. All of these traits make Gorman one of the most corrupt and sleazy cops at the Grady Memorial Hospital .","Nothing is known about Gorman's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was Dawn's police partner, eventually sharing an unknown award for his years of service. He presumably lived in or near Atlanta before the outbreak started.","Though not appearing, he and his partner save Beth Greene from a couple of zombies , and load her into a car with a white cross on the back, taking her to Atlanta . Gorman appears as Beth is getting food from the cafeteria, and he informs her that he was the one who found and saved her. He reminds her that everything costs something as she gets her food and suggests that she be a bit friendlier. Gorman walks into Beth's room as she is searching for the lollipop that Noah gave her, with it in his mouth. “Lost something?” He offers Beth a taste, which she refuses, and he forcefully pushes it into her mouth. Dr. Edwards arrives and stops Gorman before he can do anymore. “Girl should’ve been mine,” Gorman says. Edwards tells him that no one belongs to him. Dawn comes by and Gorman threatens Edwards by saying Dawn won't always be in charge before leaving the room. Gorman walks into Dawn's office just as Beth finds the spare elevator key. He offers to keep quiet if Beth will be ""friendly"". She looks over and sees Joan reanimating into a walker. She pretends to go along with it and then smashes him over the head with a lollipop jar, knocking him to the ground where he's bitten in the jugular by Joan. As she is leaving, she passes Dawn in the hallway and tells her Gorman was headed towards her office. As Beth and Noah escape, screams can be heard from Dawn's office. When Beth is caught trying to escape and brought into Dawn's office, Gorman's body can be seen on the floor.","Killed By Beth Greene (Caused) After being caught sneaking in Dawn Lerner's office and being pressured into sex in exchange for not telling Dawn, Beth, going along with it, surprises Gorman by bashing him in the head with a lollipop jar, knocking him to the ground. Joan (Infected) While on the ground, a zombified Joan crawls up to him and bites his neck, before proceeding to devour him. Dawn Lerner (Before Reanimation) Later, he is put down by Dawn to prevent reanimation.","This list shows the victims Gorman has killed: Joan (Caused, Alive) Numerous counts of zombies and possibly unnamed people","For a more in-depth look at Gorman's relationships, read here; Gorman (TV Series)/Relationships",""" Slabtown """,Gorman is the first named officer from the Grady Memorial Hospital to die on-screen.
