,,,"Anne is shown to be a calm, patient, cunning, and duplicitous woman who is a strong leader to those in her group. Under her leadership, she and her people have become adept at using limited resources to their advantage in order to combat the dead as seen by how they are able to make homemade weapons from simple junk and she appears to be extremely successful at keeping her group safe as she has kept many people alive. Anne cares about the well-being of her people and is shown to have a strong desire to obtain large amounts of resources in order to increase the fighting power of her group. It appears that she does not enjoy instigating conflicts with other groups as the motto that she characterizes her group with is; ""We take. We don't bother"". An unusual trait of Anne's is that she chooses to speak in broken English, rarely using first person pronouns. However Anne can be a cold hearted and dark person and can be extremely greedy and will do whatever it takes to obtain the resources she desires for her group. This is particularly seen when she only agrees to help Rick and Alexandria fight the Saviors if she is provided with many weapons and supplies and even after Rick brings her a large supply, she demands more. Her greed is further exemplified when she betrays Rick and Alexandria and sides with the Saviors in order to obtain a better deal than offered by Rick. Her cruel side is shown when she throws Rick into a pit to face an armored walker and later shoots Rick even after he pleads to make a better deal and gives him to Negan , showing that she is willing to allow harm to befall on others, showing that she is most likely a murderer as well. She seems to be a capable fighter and strategic leader as shown by the retreat she orders after the battle at Alexandria, which spares many of her people certain death at the hands of her enemies. After Simon 's betrayal, an emotional Anne shows a love for the great beauty of the world, having chosen her home as a place where she and her people could recreate themselves. She also speaks in full sentences for the first time to Rick and Michonne . While killing all of her zombified people, Anne is emotional at having to end everyone that she cares about. It is possible, the way she has behaved previously, was all an act, and only then was she finally being who she really was. After the war with the Saviors, Anne chooses to join the other communities so that she won't have to be alone. The loss of her people appears to have driven Anne back to the person she was before she became ""Jadis"", leader of the Scavengers. As part of this, she continues to speak in full sentences, wears regular clothing instead of her Scavenger outfit and resumes going by her real name of Anne. After being accused of murdering several missing Saviors, Anne appears to lose her faith in her new friends and suspects Rick of not trusting her. As a result, she experiences a brief return to her old ways and tries to feed Gabriel to a walker as she had done with Rick in the past. During this time, Anne admitted that she really did try to change for the better and when the moment came, she couldn't bring herself to ruthlessly kill Gabriel as she would've in the past. Her change for the better is best shown with how she intercedes on Rick's behalf to save his life after finding him near dead. After leaving Alexandria , Anne resumes the use of her ""Jadis"" alias rather than retaining use of her real name. According to Jadis, she goes by it as that identity helped her live ""so Jadis is who I am."" However, she adopts the last name of ""Stokes,"" possibly out of a lingering fondness for Gabriel Stokes whom she was in a relationship with. Aside from her possible lingering affection for Gabriel, Jadis retains a respect for Rick Grimes even years later, calling him ""the strongest person I've ever met"" and admitting to lying to protect him from becoming a test subject, having owed Rick that much. It's later shown that Jadis made some kind of a deal with Rick where she has been keeping Alexandria and the other communities a secret from the CRM. Jadis also admits that she still likes some of the people that she left behind very much and wishes them no harm. While threatening to Rick when Michonne shows up, Jadis chooses to keep Rick's secret for the time being rather than exposing him, although she does threaten Rick to keep him in line. Six years into her departure from her former life, Jadis has lost nearly all of the redeeming qualities that she once had, becoming a hardened and callous survivor bent on protecting the last light of civilization at any cost. Jadis is willing to commit cold-blooded murder and even justifies genocide as being necessary. When things threaten what she's trying to protect, Jadis can become rageful to the point of losing her temper and her usual calm demeanor that she typically keeps in even the most stressful situations. While her outward friendliness is, for the most part, a fa√ßade, Jadis does have some more genuine moments, particularly around people that she has taken a liking to. Jadis exchanges jokes with Huck upon their first meeting in years, and, although Jadis secretly uses her friendly attitude to test Huck's loyalty to the CRM, she also discusses her past and her motivations for joining the CRM without any apparent ulterior motives. Although she orders the destruction of Indira 's people , Jadis expresses a degree of genuine sympathy for them based on her own past as an artist and the destruction of her people in a similar situation. During her interactions with Silas Plaskett , Jadis is genuinely friendly to him despite her interrogation to the point of bantering a bit with the young man. Their one interaction gives Jadis a respect for Silas that remains even after his friends ' rebellion to the point that Jadis takes him on personally after inducting Silas into the CRM. However, Jadis' fondness for those that she genuinely likes appears to blind her to a degree. Jadis was unable to see that Huck was betraying her the whole time, even telling Huck the CRM's plans, until Huck exposed herself to save her friends. While Jadis was aware that Silas had only killed Dennis Graham because Dennis told him to, something that she admired rather than held against him, she appeared to be unaware that Silas was only trying to get into the CRM in order to expose them. While Jadis didn't really appear to completely believe his assertions about his friends, she was convinced that Silas would see what the CRM was working towards and buy into their vision of the world. Jadis appears to be somewhat power hungry, admitting to Elizabeth Kublek that she had taken advantage of Rick becoming entirely vulnerable for her own ends and then doing the same to Elizabeth, using her as a scapegoat. Huck even notes that Jadis appears to have moved up fast, although she was also surprised that Jadis didn't become a soldier which she would've been good at. Both Huck and Jadis acknowledge repeatedly that she's an ambitious survivor and always has been with Jadis joking that she needs a promotion by the end of the year. Although Jadis has no problems with committing murder, she shows some remorse for the deaths of those she cared about. After mortally wounding Huck, Jadis tells her that ""it didn't have to be this way"" and even offered it to end it for her rather than leaving Huck to die alone. Jadis even listened to Huck's last request, although she didn't pass the message on to Elizabeth and instead lied to her about her daughter's death. Some of Jadis' drive to protect the Civic Republic at all costs may come from lingering grief over losing the Scavengers , the community that she had built herself. While arguing with Huck about the CRM's genocide, Jadis tells her that ""you've didn't live out there. You didn't lose a community, not one you made. You can't appreciate what we have, what we can do."" Earlier, Jadis had told Huck that she had lost her purpose when she had lost the Scavengers until she found an expanded purpose in protecting the Civic Republic. It's later revealed that while Jadis was a firm believer in the CRM and their mission, she was haunted by all of the killing involved and had remorse for her actions. Jadis was also torn between being Warrant Officer Jadis Stokes of the CRM and Anne the artist who had lived in Alexandria. Jadis later admits that she cared about both communities and, after having lost her people, Jadis couldn't bear to lose either Alexandria or the Civic Republic so she worked to protect them both. Gabriel expresses a belief that the good person that Jadis was as Anne is still inside of her, proven to him by her inability to bring herself to kill Gabriel. After noticing Jadis' reaction to being called Anne, Rick believed the same thing. At the end of her life, Jadis told Rick and Michonne where to find her dossier so that they could destroy it and go home without the threat of the CRM hanging over their heads, effectively choosing to die as Anne rather than Jadis and proving Gabriel's belief in her correct. After hearing Anne's story and the reasoning behind her actions, Rick and Michonne became more sympathetic to the woman who had been both their friend and foe with Rick only killing Anne out of mercy and at her own request in the end. As a final gift, Anne gave Rick and Michonne the ring that Gabriel had found for them and wished that she had died as an artist rather than the merciless killer that she had become.","Anne lived in Virginia as an art teacher. For her art pieces, she frequently visited a landfill to gather materials she could paint on, including metal sheets and fabrics. During her time as a teacher, she took her class to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. .","In the fall of 2010, Anne survived the global outbreak of the Wildfire virus . Anne managed to escape civilization and returned to the landfill she frequented to for her art projects. Other survivors then joined her to form a large group known as the Scavengers . As Anne became the leader of the group, she believed that the fastest way for her group to become their own civilization was for them to develop their own language of broken English. By doing so, they had something that they could all participate in and bond them together in order to separate them from everyone else in every way. Anne then gave herself the name of Jadis as a new identity in order to inspire herself to help her survive the new world. As Jadis, she and her people survived by making homemade weapons from junk and scavenging the nearby areas for supplies. Jadis claimed to not enjoy instigating conflicts with other survivors, as her motto for her group was: ""We take, we don't bother"". However, it was likely she and her group resorted to killing other survivors and attacking camps and settlements to obtain resources. Jadis was extremely successful at keeping her group safe and kept as many as one hundred and fifty-five people alive. At some point, an ally of hers named Winslow died and reanimated. Jadis had him covered in armor in order to be used as a weapon to test the strength of other survivors who encountered her group, though many failed. Within months after the fall, Jadis and her people made contact with an advanced group known as the Civic Republic Military . Despite being incredibly secretive of their location and people , a CRM soldier saw their potential to aid their mission. Establishing a deal involving human trafficking, Jadis was responsible for kidnapping survivors in exchange for supplies. The CRM required that her kidnapped survivors be designated as an ""A"" or ""B"" . An ""A"" is a natural leader deemed a threat by the CRM. Instead of disposing of them, the CRM ordered they be infected so they could be taken to the Civic Republic Research Facility in Ithaca, New York for their scientists to study the progress of the virus. Survivors marked as ""B""'s were strong survivors who could be useful to the Civic Republic. They were transported to the outskirts of the city where they worked in consignment of indentured servitude for six years until they were allowed entry. As they traded humans, Jadis and her people received solar panels, safehouses, and stockpiles of food. In addition, a helicopter pad was built in the landfill for the CRM helicopters to take the captives and drop-off supplies. Twenty months after the fall, her people found an 1985 Nissan 720 Nicky RV occupied by a man named Heath , who was a supply-runner for a nearby community called the Alexandria Safe Zone . The Scavengers took the RV and traded Heath to the CRM, with Heath labeled as PPP . They later located a boathouse in the middle of a lake full of supplies, but surrounded by walkers in the lake. The supplies, however, were taken by Rick Grimes and Aaron , who also were from Alexandria. Tamiel followed the two to their community and entered in the middle of the night. Upon taking the supplies, she also kidnapped resident Gabriel Stokes . Gabriel left a clue note for Rick, writing ""boat"". Rick and his people then went searching for him and found the Scavengers.","Killed By Michonne Grimes (Caused) Tina (Infected, Caused) While in a standoff with Michonne, Anne is attacked and fatally bitten in the side of the neck by a zombified Tina. Rick Grimes (Out of Mercy) At Anne's request, Rick shoots her in the head in order to give Anne a quick death.","This list shows the victims Anne has killed: Brion (Caused, Alive; Zombified) Tamiel (Caused, Alive; Zombified) Lyla Belshaw (Caused, Alive) Robin (Caused) Percy (Caused) Jennifer Mallick Dennis Graham (Caused) Red (Zombified) At least 2 members of the Militia (Caused) 130 unnamed Scavengers (Caused, Alive, Accidental; Zombified) 2 unnamed Perimeter residents (Caused) Many unnamed Greenwood residents (Caused, Zombified) Numerous counts of zombies and unnamed people","For a more in-depth look at Anne's relationships, read here; Anne (TV Universe)/Relationships",,"For more images of Anne/Jadis, please visit Anne (TV Universe)/Gallery .","Anne is the second major recurring primary antagonist in World Beyond , the first being Elizabeth Kublek . The casting call for this character used the name Brion . Anne was described as ""30s to 40s. Male or Female. He/She is an educated, pokerfaced leader who has superior air and does not let his/her motives be known. They use as few words as possible and keeps his/her emotions in check. They just don't wear their emotions on their sleeve. He/She is confident, quiet, and chiefly concerned with how anything may benefit him/her and those he/she knows."" Brion ended up being the name of one of ""Jadis""' lieutenants. The codename used for this character in the scripts of World Beyond Season 2 was Nessa . This was used to prevent on-set leaks of Anne's return to the franchise. Anne's nickname is likely a reference to Jadis , the ""Ice Queen"" from the Chronicles of Narnia novel series, as they both share a rather blunt and cold demeanor. In "" Who Are You? "", Anne, now going by Jadis once again, confirms that Jadis is just an alias, but states that she goes by it as that identity helped her live ""so Jadis is who I am."" Anne is referred to by the surname "" Stokes "", which is Father Gabriel 's (Anne's former lover) last name, going by ""Jadis Stokes"" while with the CRM. As ""Jadis"", Anne spoke in broken English, opting to speak only in short sentences, and seemed to have a rather limited vocabulary (referring to the top of a hill in the Heaps as the ""up up up""). It was later revealed by showrunners that the Scavengers have value for words as well and only used those necessary to express what they mean and that Anne uses stunted English as a way of making others uneasy while she reads their intentions. After the murders of Brion and Tamiel , Anne's rage is so much that she speaks in a full sentence while attacking Simon . After Simon's attack, Anne began speaking in full sentences. As revealed in "" The King, the Widow, and Rick "", Anne spends her time in the landfill crafting sculptures out of wiring and other pieces of trash, often entirely nude, save for an apron. Anne's name was not revealed until the episode "" Wrath "". She is the second known character (after Karen ) to have faked her death in order to survive. Interestingly enough, both incidents occurred while their group was being massacred by former allies, and both were nearly discovered/shot at as they played dead by members of the enemy group, being the Governor and Gary , respectively. Anne is the first new survivor to be recruited for the Alexandria Safe Zone following the war against the Saviors . Anne is the fifth main character to later become an antagonist. The first being Shane Walsh , the second being Dwight , the third being Spencer Monroe , the fourth being Eugene Porter , the sixth being Gregory , the seventh being Leah Shaw , the eighth being Lance Hornsby , and the ninth being Pamela Milton . She is one of the three characters to appear in both The Walking Dead and World Beyond , the others being Beta and Edwin Jenner . Anne is one of the two TV Universe characters to appear in World Beyond , the other being Edwin Jenner . She is also one of the six TV Universe characters to appear in The Ones Who Live , the others being Rick Grimes , Michonne Grimes , Aiden , Bailey , and Gabriel Stokes . Anne is also one of four characters to appear in three shows, the others being Rick Grimes, Carol Peletier , and Negan Smith . Anne is currently the only character to be an antagonist in three TV Universe shows. Scott Gimple said the following about Anne's appearance on The Walking Dead: World Beyond : ""We are thrilled to have the terrific Pollyanna McIntosh back as Jadis, and we're excited for viewers to see how she collides with the characters in this part of the Universe. In our story, years have passed ‚Äî we'll get hints of what happened with that fateful helicopter ride and learn Jadis has new allies and alliances; she is a big part of connecting the CRM and Three Circles mythology that's seen throughout all three series. We can't wait to share it all with fans of the TWDU ."" [1] Pollyanna herself said this: ""I love the character of Jadis and I love this world so getting to inhabit her again in collaboration with the talented team at The Walking Dead: World Beyond in beautiful Richmond, Virginia was a joy. I hope audiences catch up with the first season now so they can fully enjoy this epic final season in October."" [1] In "" The Last Light "", Anne tells Huck that ""people are a resource"" while explaining how she had traded Rick to get into the Civic Republic . This is something that Negan would often say and had in fact told Anne when she had tried to trade him to the CRM in "" Still Gotta Mean Something "". She also quotes this to Rick in "" Become "" of The Ones Who Live . Anne appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "" Rest in Peace "". Anne is one of three main characters to end The Walking Dead with an unknown status, the others being Morgan Jones and Dwight . Unlike the other two, she is confirmed to be dead. Anne is the first main character to die in a series in which they did not originate from. With Anne's death, there are no Scavengers left alive. Anne is also the first and only main character to die in The Ones Who Live . Although Anne mentions several times in World Beyond that she's angling for a promotion by the end of the year, she never appears to have received it as Anne is still a Warrant Officer in The Ones Who Live a year or two later. In the Cast Diaries airing after the AMC+ version of ""Become"", Scott Gimple states that ""in the end, in telling them about the dossier, she chose Anne, which is kinda what Gabriel was saying all along"". In the Cast Diaries airing after the AMC+ version of ""Become"", Pollyanna McIntosh says of Anne ""I think Jadis' death is a very Walking Dead classic kind of death. There's emotion, there's conflicted choses that have been made, and Rick has to end things for her. It just makes it that much more complex. In my experience as an actor, I've always carried on characters with me. I hope I hold on to her groundedness and her quiet and her unabashed sense of self, as odd as that might sound, because she has been many people. She's a very grounding character to play, and I'm like a hyperactive puppy, so she's been really good for me for that. And, um, this fandom rewatches, and this fandom comes to you from all angles. And so, I feel like I'll probably be talking about Jadis with people in the street for the rest of my life, and I hope so"". In "" The Last Time "", Anne is shown to have continued with her love of art even as a part of the CRM as her room is filled with Anne's art works and art supplies. These include portraits of Major General Beale and Gabriel . The cat sculpture hiding Anne's dossier on Alexandria in ""The Last Time"" is the same one that she was working on in "" The King, the Widow, and Rick "" when Rick came to the Scavengers for help against the Saviors. Anne is the only character in The Walking Dead franchise to be classified as a primary, secondary, and tertiary antagonist. Anne is one of the four reformed antagonists in the franchise to convert back to their antagonistic ways. The other three being Bonnie (Determinant) , Dwight , and Troy Otto .",
