Overview
[
]


Frances seemingly starts as a loyal Whisperer who goes along with their values and ideals. At first, she follows every order 
Alpha
 gives, which includes abandoning her 
son
 whose crying is attracting walkers. However, Frances lives to regret this choice. One day, she begins to start acting strange, such as crying which brings the attention of some walkers. Frances is devastated about the loss of her child. Alpha confronts Frances about this, but she spares her since she relates to her situation with abandonment of her 
child
. Frances is encouraged by many to just forget about her son, including her own sister 
Mary
. However, she is unable to, and after seeing a walker with a baby carrier on it, the memories of her abandoning her son flood right back. She attacks Alpha, the person who ordered her child's abandonment in the first place. Frances ends up being killed by her own sister who throws Frances into the herd of walkers to be devoured.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Santa Monica, 
California
[
]


Nothing is known about Frances' life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had an older sister named 
Mary
 and her parents' names were John and Alice. The family lived nearby a large lake in Santa Monica where the sisters as children would ride their bicycles around it together before sundown.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


In the early days of the apocalypse, Frances and Mary were trying to survive together but kept making bad decisions by letting others misguide them. At some unknown point later, they found and joined a large group of primitive survivors known as the 
Whisperers
. Frances and her sister became adept at sniffing out locations for the dead and assisted the group in accumulating their many herds. At least 8 years into the apocalypse, she got involved with a man and eventually birthed a son.

Frances, holding her 
baby
, is part of a small group of Whisperers that accompany 
Alpha
 to the 
Hilltop
's gates. When all of the commotion draws a 
herd
, Frances' baby starts crying. She is then forced to abandon him to the 
walkers
, but the baby is saved by 
Connie
 with the help of 
Daryl
, 
Kelly
, 
Tammy Rose
, and 
Earl Sutton
.



Season 10
[

"
We Are the End of the World
"
[
]


Frances and Mary accompany Beta to collect more walkers for their herds under Alpha's orders. While luring the walkers, Frances looks at the sun and starts acting odd. Her sister orders her to focus and not jeopardize their place among the Whisperers. When they are corralling the herd on a field, Frances starts crying and causes some walkers to try to attack her. 
Beta
 kills them and says she will pay for this.

At their camp, Beta throws Frances to the ground and orders a Whisperer to kill her. As she starts screaming that her son is in a better place, Alpha demands they leave her alone. Frances is then sent to talk to Alpha alone inside a tent. Inside, she is ordered by Alpha to remove her mask and kneel. Alpha grabs Frances' head and prompts a scream heard throughout the camp, but ultimately pardons her. Frances then goes to talk with her sister when another Whisperer questions whether they should go back to the other communities.

At night, Frances tells her sister about Alpha showing mercy and how it felt to talk with her. Mary says she should forget about her son like how Alpha sacrificed her daughter for the pack. She also hopes Frances starts behaving better.

The next day, Frances follows Alpha as she leads a group of Whisperers to a field to gather more walkers. Suddenly, a satellite crashes through the sky and the herd starts to scatter. Frances sees a walker with a strapped baby carrier and remembers when she was forced to abandon her son. She runs towards Alpha and jumps on her causing the herd to get riled up. The herd closes in and Frances is pulled off Alpha by Mary and thrown to the middle of the herd to be devoured.
