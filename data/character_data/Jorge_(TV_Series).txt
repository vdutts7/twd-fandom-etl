Overview
[
]


Jorge is initially a ruthless and aggressive individual. He along with 
Felipe
 brutally beat up 
Daryl
 and kidnap 
Glenn
. When 
Rick
’s group arrives he is more than willing to get into a gunfight with them. However, after the misunderstandings are cleared between both groups, they bury the hatchet with no deaths.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


Nothing is known about Jorge's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he lived in the city of Atlanta.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


After the onset of the outbreak, Jorge and the other members of the 
Vatos gang
 found refuge in a nursing home in the city, and they decided to protect all the seniors who were left behind by the nursing staff.



Season 1
[

"
Vatos
"
[
]


As 
Daryl Dixon
 covers 
Glenn Rhee
, who is recovering the 
bag of guns
, 
Miguel
 creeps up towards the exit in the alley. He sneaks up on Daryl, to which he pops out and aims his crossbow at him. Miguel screams for help, prompting Jorge and 
Felipe
 to arrive and beat Daryl up, which is when Glenn arrives with the guns. He notices Glenn with the bag and tells Felipe to get the bag that they were also after. During the scuffle, Daryl shoots an arrow at Felipe, with Glenn dropping the bag and 
Rick Grimes
 and 
T-Dog
 arriving. Jorge abducts Glenn and quickly escapes with Felipe but leaves behind Miguel. When Rick and the others approach their compound, 
Guillermo
 exits the building with Jorge, Felipe, and some other members of the Vatos gang. Jorge is one of the men armed and ready for a fight, but stands down at Guillermo's command. During the second encounter, he is armed and ready for another possible gunfight, but an old woman, 
Abuela
, rushes out for Felipe, insisting that 
Mr. Gilbert
 needs help, ceasing the threat of a bloodshed. Jorge and his group of survivors are left with extra guns and ammo from Rick and they continue to survive and care for the elderly.



Death

Killed By


Unknown Cause


At some point, everyone at the nursing home was killed.
[1]


Although it is not known how Jorge died, in a deleted scene for "
What Lies Ahead
", Rick's group returns to the nursing home to find all of the Vatos dead due to another unknown group of people having executed them and walkers invading the nursing home afterwards. It's possible that this event still happened (sans Rick's group returning after the CDC explosion).
