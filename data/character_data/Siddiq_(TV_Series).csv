,,,"Siddiq is a kind and selfless man, who greatly values life. Due to his mother's teachings, he tries to kill every walker he comes across, as he believes the souls are of the deceased are trapped in the undead corpses. He also feels guilty over Carl's death, since Carl got bitten trying to save Siddiq, and does his best to honor him. Growing up in an Islamic household, Siddiq is a Muslim and can recite scripture from the Quran.","Siddiq was raised by his Islamic parents. His mother was a devoted Muslim who firmly adhered to the scriptures of the Quran which she taught to Siddiq and thus he became pious towards his mother's beliefs.
[1]
As a child, Siddiq was given a flute.
[2]
 At some point later in his life, Siddiq enrolled in medical school and became employed as a second-year emergency resident, where throughout his career he performed three surgeries, but no amputations.
[3]","At some point in the apocalypse, Siddiq lost his parents after they were bitten by 
walkers
 and succumbed to the infection. He then spent a lot of time wandering on his own and would kill walkers to release their trapped souls and to honor his mother's beliefs.
While looking for food around an abandoned gas station, Siddiq finds 
Carl
 and tells him that he hasn't eaten in a few days. He also tells him a quote about mercy from the Quran. When Carl suddenly points his gun at Siddiq, he tries to calm Carl down and then 
Rick
 comes and fires a few warning shots which makes Siddiq run away. Later that day, Carl gives him two cans and writes down on a paper ""Sorry."" Siddiq watches Carl from the bushes as he walks away.
Siddiq kills a 
walker
 that he has trapped when he is spotted by Carl, who apologizes for their previous encounter and recounts the things Siddiq had said to him about his mother, easing the tension in the situation. They introduce themselves, and Carl tosses Siddiq a bag of food with a bottle of water. He hastily eats and drinks the bottle as Carl begins to question him, asking him the three questions. Surprisingly, Siddiq is able to recall the exact number of walkers he has killed and explains he only killed one person 
out of mercy
.
Carl, satisfied by the answers, asks him if he trapped the walker, and why. Siddiq explains that he believes it releases their trapped souls. With a mutual trust built between them, Carl offers him a place in his community, which Siddiq accepts. While they travel back to 
Alexandria
, the two find a group of walkers devouring a deer. Siddiq is eager to put them down out of mercy, but the two quickly become overwhelmed. They manage to subdue and kill the walkers. Carl tells him he is his responsibility and refuses to leave him behind, and the two continue their journey.
Upon arriving at Alexandria, Siddiq is sneaked by Carl in the sewers until Rick returns. They spend time together and Carl shares some food with him. That night after the destruction of the community, Rick is shocked to find Siddiq in the sewers with the rest of the survivors. Siddiq then watches in sadness as Carl reveals to Rick and Michonne that he brought Siddiq to Alexandria and was bitten by a walker during the journey.
Siddiq gives Rick medicine due to feeling guilty about Carl being bitten and explains that he was a medical resident. Carl explains to his father he brought Siddiq back only because he needed them to survive, rather than because he was a doctor. When they say their goodbyes, Siddiq vows to honor Carl by showing everyone that his choice to save him mattered. Carl congratulates him on being stuck with the group before he heads out.
Siddiq and the other Alexandrians evacuate through the woods towards the 
Hilltop
. He volunteers to help clear the swamp off of walkers with 
Daryl
, 
Rosita
, and 
Scott
. Daryl and Siddiq later find a multitude of gurgling corpses blocking their route forward. They press on, quickly and carefully putting down each walker in their path.
Later that day, Siddiq and the Alexandrians arrive at Hilltop, bearing the news of Alexandria's downfall and the loss of Carl with Siddiq looking on sad at Enid's reaction. He later approaches 
Maggie
 to personally thank her for her hospitality and to reveal he has medical experience and wishes to help the community to earn his place in the group. She directs him to the trailers.
As the Hilltop prepares for the coming 
Saviors
' attack, Siddiq visits the infirmary where he attempts to get directions from 
Dana
. She is unimpressed with Siddiq's lack of experience at first, but accepts his help after Siddiq stands up to her. During the attack that night, Siddiq rushes to 
Tobin
's aid after he is injured and is nearly killed as a result when he is mistaken for a Savior by Rick, who tells him to stay down. The next day, Siddiq offers to treat Rick's wound and tries to console him about Carl's death with a quote from his religion but an angry Rick walks off.
When the wounded reanimate and attack that night, Siddiq chooses to check on the Savior prisoners. Finding the reanimated 
Katy
 feeding on a corpse, he kills her but struggles with a second one. Before it can kill him, 
Alden
 appears and kills the walker with a shovel, saving Siddiq. When Maggie arrives, she demands an explanation from Siddiq who states that he went to check on the prisoners but the pen was empty.
Siddiq comes out of the infirmary and looks around the community as Rick reads Carl's letter.
Siddiq encounters Rick while he goes to tend to Gracie. Rick speaks to Siddiq about the circumstances of Carl's death. Siddiq explains that Carl was helping him kill walkers to release their souls, as Siddiq's mother once did. He regrets not having considered the risks.
Later that day, Siddiq accompanies the Militia to fight the Saviors in the final battle. After Rick slashes 
Negan
's throat, he has a moment of thought and then orders Siddiq to save Negan. Rick orders the Saviors to return home and proclaims that Negan's rule is over. He heals Negan as Rick points to the massive herd in the distance and declares that they must unite to fight the walkers, the real threat.
When Rick and Michonne confront Negan in the infirmary and tell him his fate as a prisoner, Siddiq interrupts them to warn Michonne to be careful when she strangles Negan, being worried she might reopen the wound. He is then left to care for Negan as both Michonne and Rick leave declaring the later will rot in jail for the rest of his life.
During the year and a half that passed since the end of the war, Siddiq has integrated himself into Rick's core group and has become a prominent doctor in Alexandria. When the group goes to the Smithsonian in 
Washington, D.C.
, to search for a covered wagon and farming equipment for the Sanctuary, Siddiq takes part in the scavenging mission.
While looking around the basement with members of the group, Siddiq gets attacked by a walker whose head is full of spiders. He barely manages to kill it and admits to Rick he is more scared of the spiders, which 
Enid
 laughs at. Shortly after, the whole group reunites and gingerly uses ropes to drag an old covered wagon down the stairs and over the glass floor. The group then eaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities.
On the road, Siddiq and the others are informed by Daryl and Rosita that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Being forced to continue their journey through an alternate route, Siddiq witnesses as 
Ken
 is bitten in the arm by a walker and then kicked in the ribs by the horse. He then tries to save him with Enid's help but is unsuccessful as Kenneth dies from his injuries and then is put down by a sobbing Maggie.
In the following weeks, Siddiq moved from Alexandria to the work camp to help in the infirmary and keep teaching Enid. One morning, he watches as Enid stitches 
Cyndie
's hand when Rick orders him to return home with the next escort crew. Feeling confident in his assistant, Siddiq leaves her in charge of the patients.
In Alexandria's infirmary, Siddiq does a check up on Judith while Rick accompanies her.
Sometime following Rick's assumed death and Michonne isolating Alexandria from the other communities after the encounter with 
Jocelyn
's 
group
, Siddiq had a romance with 
Rosita
 and also became a member of the community council. Six years later, Siddiq watches as a 
group of strangers
 arrives at the community and is updated by Rosita on 
Yumiko
's condition. He then escorts her to the infirmary to check on her with the help of the other nurses.
The next day, Siddiq and the rest of the council question the newcomers to vote on whether or not they should be allowed to stay. However, they are left shocked when Michonne reveals that Magna's hand tattoo means she was once in prison before the apocalypse. Later that day, Siddiq updates the strangers on Yumiko's condition, and when Luke asks him if he has been there since the start, he says he was also found in the woods, but things were different in the past.
When 
Michonne
 decides to escort the newcomers to Hilltop, Siddiq accompanies her and tells her along the way that she should've let them stay in 
Alexandria
, but she says she still doesn't trust them and is only doing this for her 
daughter
. Upon arriving at the newcomers' giant crate of supplies, which have been displaced and destroyed by walkers, Siddiq finds Luke's flute and confesses to Michonne he used to play musical instruments in his youth. While spending the night at an abandoned factory, Siddiq and the rest wake up after hearing Michonne slice Luke's Stradivarius in half. He then listens as Luke explains art is the one thing that separates them from the animals.
The next morning, Siddiq tries to convince Michonne to come with them to Hilltop. After Michonne says she can't take the risk with 
Maggie
, he reveals that Maggie and 
Hershel
 left some time ago. Before he can explain, D.J. arrives to let them know that there walkers outside. The group gets out to find several walkers blocking the path to their horses. They kill several of them and leave. On the road, Siddiq apologizes to Michonne for not telling her about Maggie sooner, explaining that she and Hershel left with 
Georgie
 to help build a new community far away. Suddenly, two 
Hilltop soldiers
 ride up to them to inform that Rosita's injured and being cared for at Hilltop.
Upon arriving at 
Hilltop
, Siddiq is informed by Enid on Rosita's condition while 
Tara
 coldly greets Michonne and updates her on the others' situations. He then tries to tell Michonne to stop being reclusive, before hugging Carol after not having seen her in years. Later that day in the infirmary, Siddiq apologizes to Michonne again for keeping secrets from her. Suddenly, Rosita wakes up in a panic and tells them she knows where 
Eugene
 is. They tell her 
Daryl
 and the others are already looking for them but get confused after she screams that the others don’t know what they're 
dealing
 with.
When the original search group returns, Siddiq looks in sadness at 
Jesus
' body and the captive 
girl
, causing him to look in shock but also relieved at Michonne's safety. He then relocates Eugene's knee in the infirmary and leaves to grab a bandage. When Rosita vomits and heads outside, Siddiq follows to ask if she's okay, but she reveals she's pregnant with his 
baby
 due to their fling. A while later, he assists Jesus' funeral and watches in sadness as the residents hammer nails in the coffin. When the ceremony is over, Siddiq and the rest of the group leave back to 
Alexandria
.
When Michonne scolds her council for keeping her in the dark about their radio mission, Siddiq argues that she's not always right and her decision to cut ties with the other communities proves it. Michonne draws a hard line and asserts she's not willing to sacrifice her people to save the Kingdom. Later that day, Siddiq is talking with Rosita on her house porch when Gabriel arrives and they enter inside to discuss how they would deal with the new blessing.
In a flashback, Siddiq tries to help a panicking 
Jocelyn
 in Alexandria's infirmary and watches as she panics. However, 
Michonne
 arrives and decides to help her. Later that night, he enjoys a bonfire alongside Jocelyn's kids and the community kids. The next day, Siddiq watches as Michonne and Daryl return to Alexandria with the 
miss
ing
 
ki
ds
. He then goes over to help the injured Michonne.
Siddiq is among the Alexandria residents that assist the fair in the Kingdom. He watches from the crowd as 
Ezekiel
 declares they’ve finally accomplished 
Rick
, 
Carl
, and Jesus' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
""Let the fair of a new beginning begin!""
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. In the fair, Siddiq and Enid teach some residents medical training in their booth. When Michonne informs him she's going to leave for Hilltop with the first group in case the Whisperers retaliate, he tells her he has some news to tell her when she returns.
At some point later that day, Siddiq is somehow among the residents kidnapped by 
Alpha
 and taken away to 
a barn
 in the woods where they are about to be attacked by the Whisperers but are found by 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and 
D.J.
, giving the group a chance to fight back. In the middle of the chaos, Alpha arrives and the group is subdued. She then decapitates everyone as Siddiq is forced to watch, only leaving him alive as a witness to retell the horrible event.
The next day, Siddiq is found beaten and tied up to a tree by Daryl, Michonne, 
Carol
, and 
Yumiko
. He points them to a nearby hill where the pikes with the severed heads of their friends rest. The group walk devastated towards it and look in horror at the victims, with Siddiq devastated at the loss of Enid and Tara. When the group returns to the Kingdom, Siddiq delivers the tragic news and narrates how the victims fought together as a family in their last moments. He finishes the story by encouraging everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.
Several months after the 
fair massacre
, Siddiq takes shelter from a blizzard with the Alexandrians in the church. When 
Negan
 jokes about Siddiq being Rosita's baby father, he comments that everyone at the other houses must be having a better time. After the fireplace explodes, Gabriel decides they're moving to 
Aaron
's house. They all tie a rope around themselves and head out into the blizzard. The next day, after the storm is over, Siddiq treats Negan's leg injury in the infirmary and leaves him to talk with Michonne when she and the others arrive back at the community.
Some months after the blizzard, Siddiq is now suffering from extreme PTSD following his kidnapping by 
Alpha
. As 
Eugene
 presents to Siddiq charts of 
Coco
's growth, he jokes that he probably won't use any of that. Suddenly, 
Gabriel
 enters the room with a worried look and proceeds to inform them of the 
Whisperer
 mask found at the 
Oceanside
 beach.
Siddiq then accompanies the 
council
 as they enter the meeting house to discuss the recent discovery. After the meeting is over, Siddiq brings Coco to his house to puts her to bed. He then starts having flashbacks of his encounter with Alpha, but 
Dante
 arrives to check on him. Siddiq, however, assures him he's fine. 
""We're like gods in the apocalypse,""
 Dante says of the two of them being doctors and jokes about how Siddiq is looking at him.
The next day, Siddiq is among the Alexandrians that arrive at the crash site to help put out the fire and take out the walker treat. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers.
Siddiq and the rest of the 
Alexandria
 residents face against waves of walkers pouring onto the community gates over the next 49 hours. After prevailing from the exhausting battle, the community discovers that a new herd of walkers is approaching from multiple directions. In the morning, Siddiq helps to clean up the community from the corpses while 
Eugene
 warns that it will be an hour until the next wave hits.
Later that day at an emergency council meeting, Siddiq listens as the residents demand to kill 
Alpha
 and the 
Whisperers
 and has another episode of PTSD which prompts him to storm outside. Later that night, Siddiq and 
Dante
 tend to 
Carol
's wounds. Siddiq's vision blurs again as he struggles to grab the equipment to stitch her up. Dante tells him he’ll do it instead. Afterward, they tell 
Daryl
 and 
Michonne
 that she's doing well and Siddiq leaves again.
At dawn, Siddiq sees an upset Eugene leave 
Rosita
's house before Michonne approaches him. He claims he's just tired, so she leaves. Dante brings Siddiq a drink and explains that he was a field medic during combat in Iraq. He says he understands what he is going through since he also suffered from PTSD. They share a drink together and bond.
Siddiq leaves his house shaking to calm himself down outside. He notices as 
Lydia
 smiles at him from afar, but he runs back inside. The next night, Siddiq arrives after Lydia has been attacked by 
Gage
, 
Margo
, and 
Alfred
 and checks on a dead Margo. He then starts hallucinating again and runs to the infirmary to wash his face in a bowl of cold water.
Later that night, Siddiq and the council reunite in the meeting house to discuss Lydia's attack. They question Gage and Alfred, who lie and say they were attacked. Gabriel asks why Lydia's the one in the infirmary. They claim to them how their 
fri
en
d
s
 got 
beheaded
 by the 
Whisperers
 and now Margo is dead. The council then lets them go.
While the council discusses their vote on Negan's fate, Siddiq is in favor of Negan being spared and yells that they should be focusing on the Whisperers since they are the enemies. 
Daryl
 arrives and says he believes Lydia, which ties the vote. 
Gabriel
 announces he'll take the night to make his decision by tomorrow.
Siddiq and 
Daryl
 travel to 
Hilltop
 following their search for 
Negan
 to check on the community. Upon informing 
Ezekiel
 they hadn't had any luck finding Negan, Siddiq decides to head into the infirmary to help out.
Later that day, Siddiq talks with Ezekiel in the infirmary when he starts coughing very aggressively. He then reveals to Siddiq a large lump on his neck. He explains he has a family history of thyroid cancer and knows that it's unlikely he will survive his illness due to a lack of proper medical treatment in the current world. Siddiq offers alternate solutions but Ezekiel has already made up his mind. They then bond over their personal issues.
That night, Siddiq radios 
Dante
 to be updated on the situation back in 
Alexandria
 and is informed that 
Rosita
 has caught a bug. He says he'll return to the community now that he is feeling better regarding his PTSD attacks and then asks to speak to 
Carol
 before leaving the radio for Ezekiel. Afterward, Siddiq leaves the community with Daryl.
Siddiq visits the infirmary to check on the sick patients and is informed by 
Dante
 that more residents have come down with the sickness but he believes to be nothing serious. He then tells Siddiq to spend the day off with 
Coco
 and makes an inappropriate joke about checking in on 
Rosita
 but Siddiq reminds him about boundaries before leaving.
Later that day, Siddiq goes to Rosita's house to look for new clothes for Coco when he notices her lying sick on the couch. He decides to take her to the infirmary despite her objections. Upon arriving at the infirmary to find it full of sick people, Siddiq berates Dante for letting things get out of hand. He is calmed down by Rosita and rushes to prepare more herbal medications.
That night, Siddiq comforts a bedridden 
Cheryl
 and apologizes to Dante for his outburst earlier. Dante says he understands his concerns and they laugh off the incident. A while later, Siddiq holds Coco and falls sleep. He starts to dream of the harrowing night at the barn and wakes up to find himself holding Coco on the windmill to his confusion.
Siddiq wakes up in the infirmary after experiencing horrific flashbacks of 
Alpha
 killing his friends at the barn, while remembering the phrase ""Open your eyes"" being said to him. He finds 
Cheryl
 shaking from her fever, so he gives her a glass of water and covers her body with another blanket. He then checks up on 
Rosita
 and brings water to the other sick residents. While looking at his patients, he hallucinates seeing Alpha outside the window wearing her outfit from the fair. At night, Siddiq reads some medical books and takes notes until he falls asleep. He then imagines himself waking up to several hands grabbing him from under the couch and covering his mouth.
The next day, Siddiq and Dante are called to the cell to tend to the injuries of a 
Whisperer
 who has been taken hostage for questioning. When the Whisperer tells Siddiq he remembers him from the barn and starts to taunt him, Siddiq becomes nervous so Dante suggests him to head outside. As he leaves, Siddiq looks at the pointed spikes on the stairs and has a flashback to Alpha brutally decapitating 
D.J.
 in front of him. He then heads back to the infirmary to tend to a bedridden Rosita. The two of them joke about their fling and reflect on them being parents in the new world. He nearly kisses her until she has a coughing fit so he gives her more water before leaving to check on his other patients. Siddiq goes to Cheryl's room and they chat about how he needs to remain strong for the others.
Later that day, Siddiq arrives along with the others at the cell to help the Whisperer who suddenly starts convulsing. When Dante holds him, he spits blood onto his shoulder before dying from the poison. Siddiq then finds a jar of hemlock in the medical backpack and accuses Dante of killing him. However, Dante lies and says he was responsible for packing it. A while later, Siddiq goes to Cheryl's room to check on her but finds it empty and encounters Dante digging a grave as her covered body lays nearby. He walks away upset and then experiences more flashbacks from the pikes. Unable to stop them, Siddiq jumps into the pond. He remembers being told to open his eyes as 
Enid
 is decapitated. Rosita then jumps into the water and pulls him out.
Shortly after, Rosita questions Siddiq about what's really going on in his mind. He breaks down and explains he can't escape his memories about the night their friends were killed by the Whisperers. She assures him that he is doing everything he can but he says he feels he failed Enid and that he misses her. Rosita demands he pull through and fight it for her and Coco and everyone else. While talking about the sickness, Siddiq realizes that the water is what is making people sick. He heads to inspect the water pumps and after discovering one of the levers had been tampered with, he begins throwing things around out of frustration and anger.
That night, Siddiq gazes out the window in his house when Dante arrives to comfort him. He explains that everything is going to be okay because Alexandria is a special place, before declaring that Siddiq is his friend. He then starts clicking his tongue, which triggers Siddiq back to the 
beheadings
 and makes him realize that Dante was the Whisperer forcing him to watch as his friends were killed. They soon start fighting in the room as Siddiq tries to reach for a machete. Dante tackles him to the ground and puts him in a chokehold. 
""I didn't want this! Not you! Not like this. Close your eyes... Close your eyes,""
 Dante tells Siddiq in sorrow as he chokes him harder until he falls dead.
Siddiq appears alive briefly in Dante's flashback to when he first arrived in Alexandria and Siddiq performed a physical on him.
As Dante closes Siddiq's eyes and prepares to stab him in the head, they are interrupted by 
Rosita
. Though Dante lies about Siddiq's whereabouts, Rosita quickly grows suspicious and Dante attacks while Siddiq reanimates. Drawn by his daughter's cries, the reanimated Siddiq nearly attacks Coco. However, Rosita manages to overpower Dante and puts Siddiq down with Dante's knife to the head before he can hurt anybody.
The next day, Siddiq is buried in the Alexandria graveyard and a funeral is held by Gabriel who recites a passage in his memory as Rosita and the residents mourn his death.
Siddiq appears in Michonne's hallucinations, where Siddiq tells her to picture the sun. Michonne is at first glad to see him, but he starts blaming her for his death, as well as the deaths of Rick and Carl. Siddiq then asks what will happen to his family with him gone. Michonne tearfully states that Siddiq is her family, but the latter replies ""this is what it feels like to be your family"".","Killed By
