,,,"Tina is a kind and well-meaning girl. However, she suffers from diabetes which often makes her a detriment to the group since she requires regular doses of insulin. Despite this, 
Sherry
 and 
Dwight
 refuse to leave her behind. During her short time, she didn’t speak much but was very civil and respectful. After finding the bodies of 
Carla
 and 
Delly
, two teens she used to babysit, she takes the time to mourn their deaths, placing a flower on their bodies. However, it turns out they were not completely dead and reanimate. Tina proves to be unfit to survive, shown when she panics and rather than run away, somehow trips forward into the two walkers and gets bitten.","Not much is known about Tina's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she grew up in Virginia alongside her older sister, 
Sherry
. Tina also used to babysit 
Carla
 and 
Delly
 with her sister and that she required regular doses of insulin to deal with her diabetes.","During the onset of the outbreak, Tina was rescued from Washington, D.C. by her sister 
Sherry
 and brother-in-law 
Dwight
. At some point later, the trio somehow came into contact with a group of survivors known as ""
the Saviors
"", whom they subsequently joined and settled into a compound known as the 
Sanctuary
, where they worked together to earn ""points"" in exchange for supplies. Over time, however, they grew to become fearful of the community leader, 
Negan
, due to his violent sociopathic actions.
Eventually, Tina fell behind on points and became unable to purchase the insulin which she so desperately required. Negan offered to marry her in exchange for no longer operating in a point capacity and therefore always having access to medication. After informing him that she would consider his proposal, Tina escaped from the compound with Dwight and Sherry after stealing all the medicine. Shortly after, Negan discovered the trio had fled with the medicine and sent 
several
 
Saviors
 after them.

While hiding in a burnt forest, the trio encounters a stranger named 
Daryl Dixon
 and takes him hostage due to thinking he is part of the Saviors. They force him to go along with them as they search for their escape truck, nicknamed ""Patty"". Unfortunately, they find the compound overrun with walkers and when Tina faints, requiring another dosage of insulin, Daryl uses this as an opportunity to take their supplies and flees. A while later, Daryl reluctantly returns them their medicine but not before forcing them to shed their other possessions. Suddenly, 
Wade
 and his men arrive in the forest looking for them. As they hide, Daryl makes a distraction and Tina witnesses 
Cam
 get his arm bitten by a walker.
Fleeing from the Saviors, the four come across a greenhouse in the forest containing the bodies of Carla and Delly. When Tina places flowers on top of them, she suddenly realizes they have reanimated as walkers and, startled, collapses on top of them, breaking them free from the melted glass and enabling them to bite into her neck and rip out her throat. Sherry, Dwight, and Daryl watch on in horror, reacting quickly in an attempt to save her life and putting down the two walkers. After bleeding to death in her sister's arms, Tina is buried in a grave next to the greenhouse.","Killed By
