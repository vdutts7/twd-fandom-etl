Summer is one of the few Avatar Props available for Purchase, the others being 
Dale Horvath

Summer has her own life-size zombie prop.


Summer displayed the possibly most uncharacteristic behavior of any zombie in the TV series by picking up and carrying a teddy bear for no possible reason other than what might have been a distant memory or recognition of a stuffed animal when she was alive.

It's possible Summer was infected with the Wildfire variant. This version allows for greater intelligence and speed. Her memory of her teddy bear and the ability to pick it back up, as well as running at Rick, are signs that she was one of the ""variant cohorts"".


Due to the lack of decay and the freshness of her bite wound still bleeding, it's possible Summer had recently died and reanimated before Rick arrived to the gas station.


Actress Addy Miller, who portrayed Summer, returned as a similar-looking walker in the Season 8 premiere ""
Mercy
"", complete with a bath robe and slippers.


She is the only known character across all 
The Walking Dead
 media to wear braces.",
