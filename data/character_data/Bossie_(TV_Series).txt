Overview
[
]


Bossie is a ruthless and brutal survivor who kills innocent survivors with the 
Reapers
. At one point, he and 
Michael Turner
 track 
Maggie
 for miles and ambush her. He shows no mercy towards his enemies and can be quite smug and condescending towards them, such as taunting Daryl when he's about to meet Pope. Bossie is shown to be a skilled fighter, making him quite durable, quick-thinking, and stealthy. He manages to sneak up on 
Alden
 from behind and badly wounds him which later causes his death. He is able to shrug off a knife stab to the back and throws a flashbang to distract Maggie and 
Negan
. Despite his brutality, he is shown to care for his fellow Reapers. After Michael is badly hurt, Bossie resiliently carries him 10 miles back to 
Meridian
. Michael dies from his wounds which Bossie is greatly saddened over to the point of sobbing.

Despite Bossie refusing to leave Turner behind, 
Pope
 falsely accuses him of being a coward due to his wounds being on his back. Bossie is shown to greatly fear Pope and is visibly intimidated by his presence. As Bossie tries to convince Pope he was facing the enemy, he stumbles on his words and is shaking. After Pope seemingly lets him go, he sighs out of relief. However, Pope ultimately kills Bossie anyway by burning him in the fire. The rest of the Reapers are shown to be shocked and disturbed by his death. Bossie's death is a prime example that Pope doesn't care for his men despite their group supposedly being as close as family.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Afghanistan
[
]


Prior to the outbreak, Bossie was fighting in Afghanistan along with the rest of his squad which included a lot of members that would eventually become the 
Reapers
. Upon returning from war, he struggled to find jobs or deal with trauma, but the relationship between him and his comrades remained strong. He then decided to become a mercenary.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the beginning of the outbreak, as 
Operation Cobalt
 was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the 
undead
 threat, 
Pope
 and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as "the chosen ones". It is unknown if Bossie was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers, and either found or crafted his own mask with a pale-faced, smirking expression on it, and would use this mask as a scare tactic against those who were "marked" by Pope.



Tennessee
[
]


At some point, Bossie and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by 
Maggie Rhee
 despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group.



Season 11
[
]


"
Acheron: Part II
"
[
]


Bossie is among the Reapers who ambushed Maggie's group on the road leading to Meridian. They killed 
Roy
 and severely injured 
Cole
, prompting Maggie's group to scatter into the woods with the other Reapers going after them.



"
Hunted
"
[
]


Bossie and his fellow Reapers attack the members of Maggie's group, managing to kill Cole and injuring several others. He and Michael proceed to stalk 
Maggie
 for miles, tracking her through the night to a mall where they eventually ambush her and 
Alden
, who also sought refuge at the mall. Bossie attacks Alden, severely injuring him in the process, while Michael initially overpowers Maggie, but she is able to stab him in the head with a glass bottle. 
Negan
 finishes him off with a blow from his crowbar. Maggie flicks her knife at Bossie, hitting him in the back, but despite being wounded, he manages to fling a flashbang and escape along with Michael's body after it explodes and stuns Maggie and Negan.



"
Rendition
"
[
]


Bossie returns to 
Meridian
 with Michael, who had carried him 10 miles from the mall. However, Michael had much earlier succumbed to his wounds, upsetting everyone, especially 
Leah
, whom Michael was particularly close with. As the Reapers' preacher prays and chants over Michael's body in tongues, the Reapers grieve their fallen, while Bossie cries as he explains to 
Pope
 what happened. Bossie is present with 
Brandon Carver
 and 
Paul Wells
 in a small wooden shack with 
Daryl
, claiming he is about to meet Pope. Bossie jokingly tells Daryl to not be shy. He is later seen at the Reapers' campfire. He gives Daryl food when ordered by Pope. Pope commends Bossie for walking ten miles with his dead brother on his back, but then accuses Bossie of abandoning Michael in battle due the wound from the knife being on his back, and throws him into the campfire, holding him facedown until he burns to death to demonstrate God's "wrath".



"
Promises Broken
"
[
]


Mancea
 walks over to the Meridian graveyard and tends to the graves of Bossie and Turner, unknowingly being watched by 
Gabriel
.



Death
[
]


Killed By


Maggie Rhee
 
(Caused)


Pope


Due to the stab wound he got after having a knife thrown into his back by Maggie, Bossie is accused of abandoning 
Turner
 by Pope despite his story stating that he refused to leave his companion behind. As a result, Pope chooses to execute him for treason in front of the other 
Reapers
 after recruiting Daryl to join them. Given the fact that he was buried, Bossie was put down before reanimation by the Reapers rather than being left to turn like 
another
 Reaper who had met the same fate.

Trivia
[
]


Bossie's death is similar to that of 
Emmett Carson
, as both men were burned alive by their leaders after a perceived betrayal.


Bossie and an unnamed 
Reaper
 are the only two Reapers known to be burnt alive by 
Pope
 as punishment.

It would seem that unlike the unnamed Reaper, Bossie did not reanimate and was even given a proper burial, as later 
Mancea
 is seen tending to two freshly buried graves, which most likely belong to Bossie and 
Turner
.


Bossie is one of seven non-main characters to cause the death of a main character by their own hand, the others being 
Caesar Martinez
, 
Lilly Chambler
, 
Dawn Lerner
 an unnamed 
Whisperer
, 
Dante
, and 
Montanio
.
