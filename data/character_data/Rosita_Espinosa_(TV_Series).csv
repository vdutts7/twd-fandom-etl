,,,"Rosita is a feisty, brave, and extremely capable survivor with a sassy nature. She mostly appears hot-headed and single minded about the situation she is placed in. She has little room for humor and shows little hesitation in killing a posed threat. Despite her seriousness and rather sharp attitude, Rosita greatly cares for the members of her group, as demonstrated by her actions in helping Abraham and Eugene reconcile. She did not hold anger towards Eugene for lying and, more recently, saved Abraham's life after a messy breakup, showing she is compassionate. Rosita heavily relies on other people and it is clear that she has little experience being by herself. Perhaps the first time she was ever alone, Rosita reacted with anger, which can also perhaps indicate she is good at dealing with other people's emotional situations (such as Abraham's and Eugene's), but not so much her own. After watching Abraham and Glenn get beaten to death by Negan, Rosita became consumed by vengeance. Despite the fact it could cause more death to her community, she refuses to bow down to the Saviors, and recklessly attempts to kill Negan, even though the Saviors would immediately slaughter Alexandria if she had succeeded. She also became much more snide and cold to even those that she was close to, shown by how she blew off Sasha and Tara . However, by the eighth season, Rosita, having been hugely affected by Sasha's sacrifice, becomes a more level-headed survivor, as she states she has learned from her past mistakes of being angry. She even argues with Daryl 's plan to attack the Sanctuary , believing it's way too risky and saying that they should follow the original plan, stating that she believes in Rick , as well as that she doesn't want to be a part of Daryl's plan anymore and eventually decides to go back to Alexandria . Later, Rosita tells Daryl, Michonne , and Tara that she didn't stop them from attacking the Sanctuary, because she wanted them to learn from their mistake, just like she had previously learned from hers. Following her integration to the Commonwealth , Rosita is trying her best to return to the life before the outbreak, but she still remains curious about the true intentions behind the leaders of the community, while trying to make things work for the people around her.","Not much is known about Rosita's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had a six-year-old nephew, as well as a brother. She didnâ€™t know her father well and was raised solely by her mother for the first part of her life. Her mother died when she was either almost a teenager or in her early teens. Following that, her and the rest of her family moved around a lot. She has also had past military experience, [2] indicating that she may have served as a soldier. Additionally, she has demonstrated that she has a proficient knowledge of engineering, suggesting that she could have been a mechanic or at least had some mechanical training.","At some point during the outbreak, Rosita joined a group of survivors consisting of Josiah , Stephanie , Warren , Rex , Pam , Roger , Dirk , and Josephine . During her time with the group, she was taught the skills essential for her survival as well as her ability to serve as a medic. While traveling through Houston, Rosita and her group were fighting off a group of walkers until they were rescued by Abraham and Eugene. Impressed by her skills, Abraham requested her aid and informed her of a potential cure which gave Rosita a sense of purpose. As a result, she and her group joined forces with Abraham to help take Eugene to Washington, D.C. During her travels from Texas to Georgia, her group suffered repeated casualties, leaving Rosita as the sole survivor of her original group. During this time, she developed a closer bond with Abraham and eventually fell in love with him, thus allowing Abraham to move on from the emotional trauma that stemmed from his family's deaths.","Killed By Pamela Milton (Caused) Livits (Caused, Accidental) Zombies While trying to escape from the horde brought to the Commonwealth by Pamela, Rosita is bitten on the left shoulder and later succumbs to the infection. Eugene Porter (Before Reanimation) After Rosita dies, Eugene puts his friend down before she can reanimate.","This list shows the victims Rosita has killed: Young Boy (Zombified, alongside her fellow Alexandrians) Large Savior Neil (Zombified) Olivia (Indirectly Caused) Bike Park Savior Leo Lance (Alongside her fellow Militia members) Siddiq (Zombified) Alfred (Zombified, alongside her fellow Alexandrians) Alexandria Guard (Zombified, alongside her fellow Alexandrians) Panicked Woman (Zombified, alongside her fellow Alexandrians) Laura (Before Reanimation, alongside her fellow Alexandrians) April Martens (Before Reanimation) Trooper 301 (Alongside Gabriel ) Wilson (Caused; Before Reanimation, alongside Daryl , Carol , Maggie , Gabriel, and Connie ) The Warden (Caused, Alive; Before Reanimation, alongside Daryl, Connie, Carol, Gabriel and Maggie) Sanborn (Zombified, alongside Daryl, Connie, Carol, Gabriel and Maggie) 3 unnamed Wolves 21 unnamed Saviors (7 Direct, 10 alongside Alexandrians, 4 Zombified) 1 unnamed Scavenger 6 unnamed Alexandria residents (Zombified, alongside her fellow Alexandrians) At least 1 unnamed Whisperer 2 unnamed Commonwealth residents (Zombified) 2 unnamed Commonwealth soldiers (1 Zombified, 1 alongside Gabriel, Maggie, Carol, Ezekiel, Negan, and Daryl) Numerous counts of zombies","For a more in-depth look at Rosita's relationships, read here: Rosita Espinosa (TV Series)/Relationships",,"For more images of Rosita Espinosa, please visit Rosita Espinosa (TV Series)/Gallery .","The casting call for this character used the name Jordana Barraza . [3] Rosita was described as ""Late 20s. She is a beautiful and tough Hispanic woman shamed about her past."" Upon a Q&A when discussing her character Christian Serratos stated, ""She's remarkably brave. What I love about her is that she's definitely a capable woman and is capable of taking care of herself. If she was alone in the apocalypse, she would manage very well and would be just fine. We had a city-wide blackout and I panicked and ran to Steven Yeun 's apartment for help, so she has a leg up on me when it comes to bravery."" She learned her nursing skills after the apocalypse from former members of her group. On Talking Dead , Christian Serratos says that this was also where Rosita learned her outdoor survivalist skills. In a deleted scene from "" Remember "", she meets with Pete Anderson , the town 's surgeon, and is assigned to work as his medical assistant. It was revealed on the Talking Dead episode of "" Not Tomorrow Yet "" by Ross Marquand that Rosita has past military experience, and it was this experience alongside Abraham 's that helped the group execute their raid of the Savior outpost in the episode. In "" Hearts Still Beating "", Rosita was given a permanent scar on her right cheek from Arat , a Savior , when she cut into her skin. This most likely a nod to Andrea from the Comic Series . Aside from this, Rosita is the second main character to have a scar on her cheek. The first being Beth Greene and the third being Lance Hornsby .

Rosita's current signature weapon is a modern recreation of the Macuahuitl that she is wielding since Season 10 . The Macuahuitl is a long wooden paddle with serrated blades emended along its sides, this close combat weapon was widely distributed to soldiers throughout ancient Mesoamerica. This weapon is likely a tribute to Rosita's heritage. Rosita, along with Magna , Alden , and Connie , are the only surviving main characters of Season 10 to not appear in any of the six bonus episodes at the end of the season.

Her and Bob are the only main characters to die directly from the infection, as Hershel survived his bite, Andrea and Carl shot themselves before they could succumb, Tyreese died from the amputation blood loss, and Deanna allowed herself to be devoured by more walkers.
