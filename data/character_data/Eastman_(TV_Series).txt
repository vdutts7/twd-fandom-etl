“


You saw it happen, that's how this started, right? It's all 
happening right in front of your eyes
, over and over again. Your body's here, but your 
mind is still there
. There's a door and you want to go through it, to get away from it, so you do, and leads you right back to that moment. And you see that door again, you know it won't work but hell, maybe it'll work, so you step through that door and you're right back in that horrible moment every time. 
You still feel it every time
, so you just want to stop opening that door, so you just sit in it. But I assure you, one of those doors leads out, my friend.

Overview
[
]


Although he only appeared in one episode, Eastman was shown to be a highly intelligent, caring and peaceful person who was a strong, determined survivor. Before the apocalypse occurred, Eastman suffered a terrible tragedy at the hands of one of his former patients, 
Crighton Dallas Wilton
 who murdered his whole family and thus inspired Eastman to take revenge. Eastman was eventually able to achieve revenge against Wilton by capturing him and starving him to death in a cell. Eastman appeared to regret this later on and claimed that Wilton's death brought him no peace, and it was from this incident that he vowed to never kill another human being again, a vow he maintained for the rest of his life and is what finally brought him peace. Despite this he seemed to be close to the edge on a few occasions after meeting Morgan when he attacked him and destroyed a personal memento made by his daughter.

Despite his passive nature, Eastman was also a very capable fighter with his mastery of Aikido and was easily able to fend off the dead and also Morgan in his crazed state. Eastman also seemed to show a degree of respect to the Walkers as after putting them down he would bury them in a homemade cemetery with grave markers reading their real names which he got off of their driver's licenses.

During the time they knew each other, Eastman passed his wisdom and knowledge onto Morgan and effectively returned him from insanity and became a good friend, mentor and almost father figure to him. Eastman's care for Morgan was very apparent as he saved him from being attacked by one of Morgan's zombified victims, causing his own demise in the process.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


Eastman was a forensic psychiatrist working for the prison system. He had a wife, son, and a daughter and lived in Atlanta. He and his wife also built a cabin before their daughter was born. At some point Eastman took classes for Aikido.

Throughout his career Eastman interviewed over 825 convicted criminals, however he claimed that the only truly evil one he ever met was a man named 
Crighton Dallas Wilton
. While a model prisoner in the eyes of the prison staff, Eastman saw Wilton for what he was, an evil, manipulative psychopath. When the time for Wilton's parole came up, Eastman was the one to interview him and it was here that Wilton realized that Eastman had seen through his façade and attempted to kill him. Thanks to his Aikido training, Eastman was able to repel Wilton and deemed him unsuitable for release.

Following this, Wilton was able to escape from prison after manipulating the prison staff but instead of fleeing, he went to Eastman's home and savagely murdered his wife, daughter, and son. Following this he surrendered to the police and claimed the only reason he broke out was to destroy Eastman's life. Despite the murders, Wilton was somehow spared the death penalty, which enraged Eastman who then set out to enact revenge on Wilton.

A year later, Eastman kidnapped Crighton from prison and put him in a makeshift cell that he had built in his family's cabin; Crighton died 47 days later of starvation, and was later buried.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


After Crighton's death, Eastman decided to return to 
Atlanta
 to turn himself in as he felt remorseful for what he did to Crighton and received no peace from his death. When he made it to Atlanta, he discovered the 
apocalypse
 had already occurred and he then went back to his house to cut out a drawing that his daughter had done on one of the walls, losing his car on the way back and forcing him to return to his cabin on foot. Eastman later claimed that walking through 30 miles of the dead just for the piece of drywall was the best thing he ever did.

Eastman survived at the cabin by gardening, scavenging, and defending himself with Aikido, while swearing to never kill another human being ever again. He also kept a goat named "
Tabitha
" for company and to help him make cheese, and maintained a sizable 
graveyard
 for every walker he has ever killed, using IDs that he finds on the walkers to carve their names into grave markers and marking the few that he can't identify as John and Jane Does.

"
Here's Not Here
"


Eastman, hiding in the bushes, greets 
Morgan Jones
 as he arrives on his property, but after being shot at he manages to knock Morgan out with his 
staff
, then places him in his cabin's cell. For the next few days he feeds Morgan and introduces himself, wanting to treat Morgan's PTSD and become friends; Eastman is planning a journey but needs someone to accompany him. He lets him out of the cell (which was unlocked the entire time - Eastman had long since thrown the key into the river) only to be attacked - breaking his daughter's wall drawing in the struggle. Eastman prevails and considers killing Morgan in revenge, but spares him instead.

The next morning he leaves Morgan to perform some errands, then returns to discover he had saved Tabitha from a pair of walkers. He thanks him and shows him a new staff he had crafted from one of Morgan's makeshift spears, and then proceeds to train him in the art of Aikido and the way of peacemaking. The two men bond over a long period, with Eastman revealing some of his backstory one night - involving Crighton and the cabin cell he built for him. While gathering some gear from one of Morgan's campsites and helping Morgan grieve for his own lost family, a walker approaches, but Morgan 
recognizes it
 and is too stunned to react; Eastman pushes him out of the way and is bitten, but manages to kill the walker. Morgan's mental state regresses and he attacks Eastman again, who subdues him and leaves him behind - taking the dead walker with him. He is next seen at 
the graveyard
 burying the same walker, when Morgan returns with another dead walker and Tabitha's corpse. Morgan then notices Crighton's grave, and Eastman reveals more of his backstory - from Crighton's kidnapping and death, up until his discovery of the apocalypse.

Later inside the cabin, Eastman grows sicker from his bite wound and suggests that Morgan should leave - encouraging him to find other people to survive with. He then reveals that there is a gun in a lock box outside - implying that he is ready to die. Before they head outside, Eastman passes Morgan his daughter's rabbit foot - hoping that it will give him luck on his travels. Morgan subsequently buries Eastman in his cemetery before leaving the cabin for good.

"
All I See Is Red
"


Eastman is one of the people whose loss continues to haunt 
Morgan
, appearing in red-tinged flashes of his death to Morgan.

Over a decade after leaving, Morgan buries 
Grace
 in the 
makeshift cemetery
 near 
Eastman's Cabin
, the place that Morgan had 
first
 regained his sanity after losing his family. Morgan hands his daughter a new 
staff
 that he found for her and suggests that she go practice with it. Holding his 
battle axe
 - which is made mostly out of the staff that Eastman had given him - Morgan addresses his old friend's grave. 
"Have you seen how much this has changed since you first gave it to me here? I suppose you'd say I have too. You made that all possible with all that you did and all that you taught me. There's something I realized just lately, that all life is precious, but that is not about killing or not killing. It's about... what you do with the time that you have. And the... the people that you have, ya know? I need you to look after Grace for me. Please."
 Watching Mo practice her aikido, Morgan offers her some of the same advice that Eastman had given him, laughing at the fond memories that it brings up.

Morgan announces that they have to get going as Morgan has decided to go looking for the friend that he mentioned who told him not to run, noting that it wouldn't be the 
first
 
time
 that they found their way back to each other. Taking his radio, Morgan makes an open broadcast. 
"This message is for 
Rick Grimes
. It's Morgan Jones. Man, I'm gonna come and look for you, whether you're at 
Alexandria
 or not. I will leave this message every morning at dawn, and I will leave the walkie on for a few minutes after. Who knows? Maybe you might even be listening."
 Morgan touches a kiss to Grace's grave and he has flashes of Eastman, 
Benjamin
, 
Nick Clark
, 
Isaac
, 
Rachel
, 
John Dorie
, 
John Dorie Sr.
, 
Alicia Clark
, 
Jenny
, 
Duane
 and Grace, all of the people that he's cared about and lost along the way. This time, Morgan only sees fond memories of his loved ones without the red-tinge, at peace at last with those that he's lost. With one last look back at Grace and Eastman's graves, Morgan and Mo depart, heading for Alexandria and to find Rick.

Upon seeing an undead man, Morgan has an episode of PTSD and freezes in place as Morgan had previously strangled him to death. Eastman rushes in to put down the walker before it can harm Morgan, and pushes him out of the way and is bitten in the back. Eastman then puts the walker down.



Morgan Jones

Trivia
[
]


His weapon of choice is a wooden 
staff
.

Eastman is the first character to prefer the staff. Following in his footsteps are 
Morgan Jones
, 
Benjamin
, 
Henry
 and 
Lydia
 all of which Eastman is directly or indirectly responsible for through his mentoring of Morgan.


The marker Morgan made for his grave read "
E. Eastman
".

John Carroll Lynch
 speculates that his first name is 
Elwood
, named after Elwood Blues.


Eastman appears to be ambidextrous, as he is shown using a fork and a pencil with his left hand, but also using his staff with his right hand.


Eastman's death is similar to 
Dale
's; 
Carl
 was responsible for attracting the walker that disemboweled Dale, while Morgan was responsible for attracting the 
walker
 that bit Eastman; both characters were eventually put down later, and both voluntarily, before reanimating. However, in Eastman's case he may have committed suicide or had Morgan shoot him after reanimation as it is ultimately unclear what he had planned when Eastman led Morgan to his gun.


Eastman is mentioned by name in the 
Fear the Walking Dead
 episode "
Still Standing
" while Morgan is talking to 
Grace Mukherjee
 about how he was taught that 
"all life is precious"
.


Alongside 
Josiah LaRoux
, he is one of only two known characters to take the time to properly bury their walker kills.
