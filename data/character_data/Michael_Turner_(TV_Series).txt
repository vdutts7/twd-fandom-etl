“


Michael Turner was his name. We fought all over the world together. Pope brought him in after our last tour, when he started his company. (...) Michael was like me, you know? He didn't have a family. He was the little brother I never had. You know, the little brother I always wanted. And he's dead. You know, we lost a lot of people here, and it's been hard. But not like this. This is the first time I've lost someone close to me in a 
long
 time. Well... except for maybe 
you
.

Overview
[
]


Michael is a relentless and brutal survivor. After the 
Reapers
 attack the group at night, he and 
Bossie
 track 
Maggie
 for miles. Michael is shown to be quite durable. He gets slashed in the leg by a knife and falls down a flight of stairs but is later still able to tackle Maggie and almost kill her. Maggie manages to stab him with a broken glass bottle and 
Negan
 finishes him with a crowbar.

Though to Maggie's group Michael is just another enemy, to the Reapers they saw Michael as their brother and was seemingly very well-liked among them. After his death, the Reapers are shown to be mourning his death. When Michael is badly wounded in the fight with Maggie and Negan, Bossie refuses to leave Michael behind, carrying him for 10 miles and is later seen bawling over his death. Michael had a very close relationship with 
Leah Shaw
 who described him as 
"the little brother I never had."
 According to her, he was similar to herself since he didn't have much family. Leah compares the closeness with him to her relationship with 
Daryl Dixon
.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Michael joined the group that would eventually become the 
Reapers
 right after 
Pope
 founded his private military company. During his time with the group, Michael would develop a close relationship with 
Leah
, as neither of them had real families. Leah came to view Michael as the little brother she never had.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the beginning of the outbreak, as 
Operation Cobalt
 was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the 
undead
 threat, 
Pope
 and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as "the chosen ones". It is unknown if Michael was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers, and either found or crafted his own mask with a large-toothed skeletal expression on it, and would use this mask as a scare tactic against those who were "marked" by Pope.



Tennessee
[
]


At some point, Michael and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by 
Maggie Rhee
 despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group.



Season 11
[
]


"
Acheron: Part II
"
[
]


While not part of the 
Reapers
' initial attack on Maggie's group, Michael, along with 
Leah Shaw
, 
Jenson
, and 
Brandon Carver
, remained hidden near the forest.



"
Hunted
"
[
]


Michael and his fellow Reapers attack the members of Maggie's group, managing to kill Cole and injuring several others. Michael and 
Bossie
 proceed to stalk Maggie for miles, tracking her through the night to a mall where they eventually ambush her and 
Alden
, who also sought refuge at the mall. While Michael initially overpowers Maggie and tries to kill her with 
Elijah
's stolen kama, he is stabbed in the head by her with a broken bottle, followed by a swing to the back of the head with a crowbar by 
Negan
. Bossie, who was attacking Alden, notices Michael severely injured after being struck in the back with a throwing knife by Maggie. Bossie throws a flash bang grenade, allowing him to rescue his wounded friend and flee undetected from the disoriented Maggie and Negan and incapacitated Alden.



"
Rendition
"
[
]


Michael is brought back to 
Meridian
 by Bossie, who had carried him ten miles from the mall. However, Michael at some point had succumbed to his wounds, upsetting everyone, especially Leah, whom Michael was particularly close with. Leah and 
Brandon
 are brought to see Michael's body where 
Mancea
 is performing a prayer and chanting over Michael's body. Nearby, Bossie cries as he explains to 
Pope
 what happened. As the Reapers grieve over the loss of their friend, Pope declares that they must make Maggie's group feel his and God's wrath.

At the campfire that night, Pope states that Turner will get a proper burial and accuses Bossie of abandoning Turner to die due to Bossie's wounds being in his back. As a result, Pope burns Bossie to death as a 
punishment
.



"
Promises Broken
"
[
]


Mancea
 walks over to the Meridian graveyard and tends to the graves of Michael and Bossie, unknowingly being watched by 
Gabriel

Trivia
[
]


While his death wasn't confirmed on screen until "Hunted", 
Talking Dead
 confirmed during its In Memoriam segment that Michael had died.

While Michael was not named in the In Memoriam segment, he was referred to as the 
Creeper Reaper
.


Along with Daryl, Turner is also the only member of the Reapers to join after Pope built his private military company. Therefore it is not confirmed whether or not he served in Afghanistan like the rest of his group.
