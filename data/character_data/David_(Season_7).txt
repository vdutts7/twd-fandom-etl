Overview
[
]


David is a cruel, sadistic, cunning, perverted, creepy, and wretched man who takes sadistic joy out of beating and raping people. Due to being a member of the 
Saviors
, he believes himself to be safe from harm due to 
Negan
 being in control and greatly enjoys taunting and harassing the residents of 
Alexandria
. David is shown to be a rapist, as he attempts to do so to an imprisoned 
Sasha
. When he is caught by Negan, David reveals himself to be pathetic and cowardly. He tries to beg for forgiveness and only seems remorseful that he got caught. David's heinous actions leads to his own demise.

Post-Apocalypse

At some point in the apocalypse, David somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined. 

David aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.

David is among the Saviors to raid 
Alexandria
 for supplies, weapons, and furniture. He is encountered by 
Carl
 in the infirmary as he is threatened for taking the medicine. However, 
Negan
 interferes and is able to get Carl to stand down. Shortly after, David taunts 
Enid
 and refuses to give back her balloons until she says "please". Later that day, David smirks as Negan gives his final taunts to Rick before climbing in the truck with 
Daryl
 and the other Saviors and leaving Alexandria. 



"

David is stationed at the front gate with 
Gary
, 
Laura
, and other Saviors as they wait to inspect the offering from the Alexandrians. When 
Aaron

Rick

"
Hostiles and Calamities
"
[
]


David is among the Saviors to beat up 
Dwight
 after Negan learns that Sherry and Daryl have escaped the Sanctuary. When the newcomer Eugene is brought before Negan, David laughs at him and responds with his fellow Saviors in unison that his name is Negan. He is later present on the factory floor when 
Dr. Carson
 is accused of freeing Daryl and is thrown into the furnace and burnt to death as a result of his actions. That night, David helps capture 
Sasha
 when she infiltrates the compound to kill Negan.



"
Something They Need
"
[
]


David visits the imprisoned Sasha the next morning and introduces himself. When she asks for water, he starts to sexually harass her. Before he can rape her, Negan intervenes and asks David what he was doing. However, Negan is fully aware of his rape attempt and deems his actions as inhuman. As punishment, Negan stabs him in the neck, killing him. Sometime later, David reanimates inside the cell and is put down by Sasha to gain Negan's trust.
