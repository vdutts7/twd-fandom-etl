Alice is among the Alexandrian children to enjoy the bonfire with 
Winnie

Linus

P.J.
, and the other kids from 
Jocelyn
's 
group

Judith
, 
Jonah
, and 
Marcus
, are kidnapped and brought to an abandoned school.

When 
Michonne
 and 
Daryl

"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. At the fair, Alice enjoys a candy apple and walks around with other young women as they explore and enjoy the fair.

Later that day, Alice and Frankie notice a flustered 
Henry
 and ask if he is looking for someone. 
"I hope you find them!"
 Frankie tells him as he continues his way around the fair. When her mother goes missing, Alice and

The next day, Alice listens from the crowd as 
Siddiq
 delivers the tragic news about the fate of the missing fair attendees, tells them how brave the victims were in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story.
