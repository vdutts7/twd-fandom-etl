,,,"Simon is a ruthless, brutal, unpredictable, and articulate man with a sadistic and unnerving sense of humor, and is considered even by Negan too violent and ""psychotic"". Simon is also shown to be highly intelligent. He possesses a very impressive and detailed vocabulary he uses to both motivate and to terrify. He has displayed extreme loyalty to his leader, and as such is highly valued and trusted by him. Like Negan, Simon is not beyond using fear and intimidation to achieve his ends and is a remorseless, cold-blooded mass murderer and is not at all bothered by the excessive violence that the Saviors employ, as seen when Negan casually asked him for a pen to mark where he would cut Carl 's arm off. Simon simply grants Negan's request and shows no emotional reaction to the situation, which seems to imply that Simon has committed similar acts of brutality and has become desensitized to it and is even shown to take sadistic pleasure in the violence employed by the Saviors. As the second highest-ranking member of the Saviors, Simon held a large amount of power surpassed only by Negan himself, and also seemed to be a very capable leader and strategic thinker as he cleverly organized the capture and ambush of Rick's group by predicting which roads they would travel on and constructed barricades accordingly to lead them into an ambush. In spite of being Negan's most loyal follower, it is gradually revealed that the two drastically differ in their views on how to deal with disloyalty and defiance on the part of their subjugated communities. Unlike Negan who chooses to kill a few to save many and get others back in line, Simon is shown to be even more bloodthirsty and is willing to destroy entire groups due to their disobedience to the Saviors, as seen when he had the Scavengers , except for Jadis , exterminated due to their betrayal of the Saviors for siding with Rick and Jadis' lack of remorse. He is not bothered causing harm to children or the elderly as proven by a comment to Rick in which he claimed that Carl was not punished hard enough for killing two Saviors in an attempt to kill Negan. Simon also executed the elderly Brion without any hesitation, and had adolescent members of the Scavengers massacred. It is also confirmed that he had all the male survivors above the age of 10 from the Oceanside slaughtered after they initiated a rebellion against the Saviors, something that even shocked Negan himself. Negan later expressed regret for not killing Simon himself after this sick and twisted act and giving Simon a second chance instead. Simon is shown to be a hypocrite about this, angrily berating the Croat for crossing the line and torturing a kid to death despite Simon's own massacre of all males over the age of ten at Oceanside. However, he may have been doing this to win points with Negan as Simon is shown kissing up to Negan and trying to angle for more power for himself in place of the Croat. In Season 7 , at the command of Negan, he assumes direct responsibility for the continued subjugation of the Hilltop Colony after the elimination of one of the Saviors' outposts and takes pleasure in terrorizing both the Hilltop and Alexandria when called upon to do so. He has demonstrated and verbally expressed his admiration for authoritarian leaders, and those who ""lead by example"", something which he himself puts into practice with his uncompromising methods, and strict obedience to Negan. He retains this even into Season 8, respecting Gregory enough despite his failures to include Gregory into Simon's failed coup. During Season 8 and the war, Simon begins and eventually lost patience for Negan's methodology of only killing when an example is to be made. While Negan believes it to be a principle of the Saviors to ultimately unite communities and only resort to violence to keep people in line, Simon believes the Saviors should simply kill off all of the communities that oppose them and instead only spare communities completely loyal to them. Shortly after having this disagreement with Negan, Simon travels to the Heaps and eventually orders his men to gun down the Scavengers. Simon merely grins in satisfaction as he watches unarmed men, women and even children get killed on his orders, displaying how little Simon values concepts such as morality or mercy, while at the same time defying Negan's orders. He subsequently lied to Negan about this instead of owning up to his actions. Upon Negan being kidnapped by Jadis, Simon takes advantage of the situation to assume leadership over the Saviors and manipulates them all into destroying the Hilltop for Negan, even though this is directly against Negan's wishes. Simon is even shown to be willing to sacrifice his own fellow Saviors in his quest to exterminate his enemies as seen before he launches his attack on the Hilltop in which he makes it clear that he does not care about the 38 Savior prisoners that Maggie has inside and is willing to sacrifice them in order to launch his assault. Simon demonstrates during this conflict that his ruthlessness and desire for blood has completely overclouded his once adept strategic thinking as he leads his people up against machine guns with bows and arrows and tainted walker weapons and as a result loses nearly half of his soldiers and quickly retreats, showing that he also has cowardly tendencies. Upon Negan's return and him humiliating Simon in front of the rest of the council and learning of Negan's next plan of action, Simon reaches the end of his tether and attempts to lead a coup in order to get rid of Negan for good, showing that all respect he had for his leader is now gone and that he is desperate to take over the Saviors. Ultimately, Simon's thirst for blood and desire to both exterminate his enemies and take command of the Saviors would lead to his own demise. And it is at the hands of his leader and closest ally, the man who once considered him his most loyal and valuable follower. Years after Simon's death, after hearing about the war from Jerome , the Croat tells Negan that he can only imagine just how much damage Simon had caused. The Croat claims that Simon had never really listened to Negan like Simon had always seemed to, suggesting that Simon was always disloyal to at least some degree and only seeking his own power despite Simon supposedly being one of Negan's most faithful and loyal followers at one time. Although Simon and the Croat had a very poor relationship in general, the Croat recognized this disloyalty in the other man long before Simon actually tried to take over the Saviors for himself.","Simon grew up in Virginia, however, extensively little is known regarding that of his early life. Simon grew to become a charismatic, efficient and hardworking man, (but not without an aggressive side) who sold subprime mortgages to unsuspecting customers without their knowledge while lying about his intentions and was fully able to justify his immoral motives to other people even though he was fully aware of his own sinister intentions. [1]","At some point after the onset of the outbreak, Simon discovered an abandoned factory, where some survivors lived and thus he joined the group. Because of their incapable leader, Simon came into contact with Negan and subsequently joined his group named ""The Saviors"". At some point later, Negan along with Simon's and other Saviors' help managed to seize control over the group from the previous leader and established the factory as their central headquarters as well as their personal home which became titled "" The Sanctuary "". [2] The two also developed a firm loyalty towards each other and thus Negan later appointed Simon as his personal second-in-command. [3] Their group eventually grew to contain well over 600 survivors. Shortly after Negan took charge over the factory and appointed Simon as his right-hand man, he learned that previously Simon and his men had encountered a group of survivors and thus enslaved them and forced them to work under their rule. Eventually the group attempted to fight back but they were overwhelmed and defeated. As punishment for their defiance, Simon had every single male above the age of 10 exterminated ; something that Negan did not approve of at all. The surviving female survivors later fled their settlement and disappeared to a new location. After Negan heard about Simon's orchestration of the massacre and despite being his most loyal follower, Negan kept a close eye on Simon since then due to his brutal nature, disobedience of certain orders and possibility of being a threat in the future because of what he is capable of. Throughout the following months, Simon aided his leader in terrorizing other survivors and communities they encountered into subjugating to Negan's will; during where he committed several brutal atrocities in order to do so, including murdering innocent people, displaying gruesome acts to implement superiority and fear to other survivors, as well as orchestrating several raids and ambushes to whoever opposed them. [4] At some point after discovering the Hilltop Colony , they demanded half of their supplies in exchange for leaving the farming community unscathed, demonstrating their methods and bringing their intentions to light by executing Rory , a 16-year-old member of the colony. [5] Roughly during the same period, the Saviors discovered another community known as the Kingdom where upon meeting with the community leader they demanded a portion of supplies to be produced in exchange for leaving the community unscathed. During this period, Simon often clashed with the Croat , one of Negan's highest-ranking lieutenants and the interrogator of the Saviors. The Croat's methods proved to be too extreme for even Simon while, in return, the Croat had an extremely low opinion of Simon and believed that, despite apparently being one of Negan's most faithful and loyal followers, Simon wasn't actually truly loyal to him and never really listened to Negan. Simon used the Croat's extreme actions to angle for more power for himself and less for the other man and berated the Croat for brutally torturing and murdering a young girl despite his own hypocrisy about not harming kids. The torture and murder of the young girl led Negan to try to kill the Croat who escaped with his right ear blown off . The Croat's escape solidified Simon's position as Negan's undisputed second-in-command.","Killed By Himself (Caused) Dwight (Caused) After Simon attempts to lead a coup against Negan, he is betrayed by Dwight leading Negan to challenge Simon to a fight for leadership. Negan Smith (Alive) Simon initially gets the upper hand, but Negan ultimately overpowers him and then strangles him to death. Rather than prevent Simon from reanimating, Negan chains him to the Sanctuary fence with the other walkers. An unnamed Savior (Zombified) Following Negan's defeat and the establishment of peace, Simon is put down along with the other fence walkers.","This list shows the victims Simon has killed: Beatrice 's Husband (Caused) Cyndie 's Mother (Caused or Direct) Cyndie 's Brother (Caused) Library Survivor (Caused or Direct, Alive) Neil Dean (Indirectly Caused) Brion (Alive) Tamiel (Alive) Tobin (Caused, Alive) Kurt (Caused, Alive) Kevin (Caused, Alive) Dana (Caused, Alive) Wesley (Caused, Alive) Katy (Caused, Alive) Bruce (Caused, Alive) Craig (Caused, Alive) Crystal (Caused, Alive) Stephanie (Caused, Alive) Gary (Indirectly Caused) Himself (Caused, Alive) Justin (Indirectly Caused, Alive) Arat (Indirectly Caused) All male Oceanside residents above the age of ten (Caused or Direct) At least 5 unnamed Library survivors (1 Alive, Caused and Direct) At least 130 unnamed Scavengers (Caused and Direct, Alive) 13 unnamed Hilltop residents and refugees (Caused) 1 unnamed Alexandria resident (Caused) 20 unnamed Saviors (Indirectly Caused) Numerous counts of zombies and unnamed people","For a more in-depth look at Simon's relationships, read here; Simon (TV Universe)/Relationships","For more of Simon's quotes, please visit Simon (TV Universe)/Quotes .

In the casting call for the game Grand Theft Auto V , Steven Ogg 's character was named Simon, later changed to Trevor in the final version. [6] Steven Ogg noted that he cited the film The Big Short as inspiration for Simon's backstory. Simon appears to hold an interest in art, as expressed by his admiration of a masterpiece portrait of Charles V owned by Gregory which he accurately described as 'management by example"", [7] he also appeared slightly impressed with Anne 's metal artwork in the Heaps . Simon is said to enjoy alcoholic beverages, most notably tequila and supposedly gin; however he later compares it to turpentine, he also dislikes scotch as he personally describes it as ""ashtrays and window cleaner"".
