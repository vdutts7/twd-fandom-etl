“


A woman like you, 
no weapons, no protection, no clue!
 You really shouldn't be out here alone. You know, we were just on our way to your place. We can give you a ride back. Maybe, they'll let us in if you're with us.

Overview
[
]


Jiro is an arrogant, snide, and callous individual who has no qualms hurting others to get what he wants. When he and his men find 
Carol
, she puts on the impression of she being a timid woman. He proceeds to taunt her to the point of causing her to seemingly break down. As she breaks down he merely smiles sadistically. He is shown to have a sarcastic sense of humor such as when Carol demands Jiro surrender he sarcastically states, 
"Yeah I think I'm gonna pass on that!"
 He is also shown to be defiant, as he attempts to take one last stand against Carol despite the odds stacking against him.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Jiro's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Jiro somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as one of Negan's personal lieutenants. 

Jiro aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 6

"
East
"
[
]


Jiro is heading to 
Alexandria
 in a pick-up truck with 
Miles
, 
Roman
, and a couple of Saviors when he opens fire on 
Carol
's car, shooting out a tire. He demands that she surrender and offers to take her back to Alexandria, taunting her as she begins to break down. When Jiro orders his fellows Saviors to secure her, Carol opens fire on the men but Jiro manages to survive as he hides behind the truck and hears Miles be killed. Carol then orders Jiro to surrender, to which he refuses. He unsheathes his knife to attack Carol but is shot. Shortly after, he is found by 
Rick
