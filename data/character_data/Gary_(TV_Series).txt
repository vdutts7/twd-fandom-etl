Overview
[
]


Gary is a brutal, vicious, and aggressive individual. He is shown to be quite violent, such as when he beats up 
Aaron
 for seemingly leaving a rude note for the 
Saviors
 and also beating 
Dwight
 under 
Negan
's orders. He is shown to follow any order he is given no matter what. He goes along with killing the 
Scavengers
 without question and later even mocks 
Jadis
' corpse (believing her to be dead) and even spits on her.

Initially, Gary is shown to be a trusted ally of Negan, seeing as Gary was part of the council. Gary also seemed to be loyal to him. However, it appears Gary is more loyal to Negan's right-hand man, 
Simon
. Due to probably disliking Negan's leadership, Gary joins Simon's coup against Negan. This would lead to him, along with Simon's other loyalists, to be killed by Negan's men.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Gary's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Gary somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as one of Negan's personal lieutenants.

Gary aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 7
[
]


"

"
Hearts Still Beating
"
[
]


Gary is stationed at the front gate with 
David
, 
Laura
, and other Saviors as they wait to inspect the offering from the Alexandrians. He commends Spencer for doing a good job with all of the supplies he found. When 
Aaron
 and 
Rick
 arrive with a truck full of supplies, David goes through the goods until he finds a note that he thought was meant to disrespect him and the Saviors. As a result, Gary, along with David, proceed to brutally beat Aaron until calling off the attack.



"
Hostiles and Calamities
"
[
]


Gary is among the Saviors to beat up 
Dwight
 after Negan learns that Sherry and 
Daryl
 have escaped the Sanctuary. When the newcomer Eugene is brought before Negan, Gary laughs at him and responds with his fellow Saviors in unison that his name is Negan. He is later present on the factory floor when 
Dr. Carson
 is accused of freeing Daryl and is thrown into the furnace and burnt to death as a result of his actions.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"
[
]


Gary is among the Saviors traveling with Negan to Alexandria. When they come across the fallen trees in the road, he uses a chainsaw to help remove the branches. Upon arriving at Alexandria, Gary opens the back to a truck, revealing the bombs that were supposed to detonate on the Saviors at Rick's command, which ultimately failed. When the Militia and the Saviors engage in a gunfight, Gary manages to escape with his fellow Saviors.

]


"
The Big Scary U
"
[
]


Having becoming trapped inside the Sanctuary, Gary is present in the room as the Savior lieutenants discuss how to rescue Negan, how to handle the workers, and the possibility of a spy among their ranks. After Laura bursts into the room, warning everyone the workers are coming up the stairs to express their demands, he and the others try to calm the angry workers and even draws his gun on them when Regina shoots one of the workers attempting to shoot Simon. They then hear whistling and everyone kneels as Negan arrives to the relief of mostly everyone. Gary, Arat, and Laura later inform Negan and the lieutenants that a Savior took weapons from the armory and armed the workers.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"
[
]


When Eugene's plans successfully divert the herd away from the Sanctuary, Gary is among the Saviors that accompany Simon surround the Hilltop convoy at night. He gets out of the truck and pulls a gun on

Neil
 instead.



"
The Lost and the Plunderers
"
[
]


Gary leads 
Norris
 and 
D.J.
 as they carry the coffin containing an undead 
Dean

Simon
 to the junkyard where he participates in the massacre that leaves all of the

"
The Key
"
[
]


Gary is part of the Savior army dispatched to the Hilltop to use their improvised weapons when Rick attacks the convoy on the road. While Gary and the others are eager to find Negan, they are told to stay put by Simon who assures them that he and Dwight will find Negan instead. When Dwight and Simon return to the crowd of Saviors empty-handed, Gary questions Negan's whereabouts but is reminded to stay in line. Having been convinced by Simon to accomplish Negan's mission on his honor, Gary joins in with the other Saviors cheering and ready to wipe out the Hilltop.



"
Do Not Send Us Astray
"
[
]


Gary and the other Saviors arrive at the Hilltop prepared to attack the settlement. After several vehicles lose their tires, he is instructed to remove the tire spikes from the road so they can further advance into the Hilltop.

"
