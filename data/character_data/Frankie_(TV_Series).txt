Overview
[
]


Frankie is shown to be friendly, energetic, and fun-loving woman. She is quite enthusiastic when 
Eugene
 shows them a homemade bomb. However, though she initially seems to be quite happy, this is actually a façade. In reality Frankie is quite scarred and traumatized from being 
Negan
's wife. As one of Negan's wives, Frankie was often used by him for his own enjoyment. She is shown to be horrified at his heinous acts, such as burning 
Emmett Carson
 in the furnace. At one point, she and 
Tanya
 ask Eugene to make pills for 
Amber
 so she can commit suicide. However, in actuality, the pills are actually intended to kill Negan, showing how much she despises him.

After the 
Savior
 war is over, Frankie moves to 
Alexandria
 and appears to have bettered her life. She has adopted a 
daughter
 who she is shown to care greatly about. However, Frankie ends up being one of many people to be kidnapped by Alpha and taken into a barn. When 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and 
D.J.
 come and try to save everyone, Frankie shows her bravery and fights back against the 
Whisperers
 in a last stand.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


San Francisco, 
California
[
]


Nothing is known about Frankie's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she was a licensed massage therapist, and lived within the San Francisco-metro area. 



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Frankie somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which she subsequently joined upon where she volunteered to become one of 
Negan
's "wives" in order to avoid working for points. She would also give massages to Negan on occasions.



Season 7
[
]


"
Sing Me a Song
"
[
]


While Negan gives 
Carl
 a tour around the 
Sanctuary
, Frankie spends her time in a well-furnished room with 
Sherry
, 
Amber
, 
Tanya
, and a couple of 
Negan
's other wives. As soon as Negan leaves the room, Frankie and the other women comfort an upset Amber. Later that day, Frankie stands with the other wives and witness 
Mark
's face being ironed.



"
Hostiles and Calamities
"
[
]


When newcomer Eugene gives a solution to preserving the walkers used at the gates, Negan allows him to spend that night with his wives but with the only condition of not having sex with them. At night, Frankie, Tanya, and Amber watch 
Eugene
 as he plays video games when Tanya jokingly asks if he knows how to make a bomb after becoming interested in his knowledge. Shortly after, the wives accompany Eugene outside and watch as he makes a homemade bomb.

The next day, Frankie and Tanya convince a reluctantly Eugene to make some pills so a depressed Amber can commit suicide. She is later present on the factory floor when 
Dr. Carson
 is accused of freeing Daryl and is thrown into the furnace and burnt to death as a result of his actions. After watching the grizzly scene, Frankie and Tanya visit Eugene in his apartment where he refuses to hand them the pills after correctly guessing they are for Negan instead. 



Season 8
[
]


"
The Big Scary U
"
[
]


Though unseen, Frankie gives Negan a massage after he escapes the undead swarming the Sanctuary.



"
Dead or Alive Or
"
[
]


Frankie is assigned to the new 
outpost
 as Eugene's servant, responsible to help with whatever he may need. She expresses interest in Eugene's work and asks him to teach her how to make bullets, but he ignores her request and instead tells her to relay his breakfast order to Tanya. When Negan arrives, Frankie takes a knee along with everyone else and witnesses a captured 
Gabriel
 being delivered to Eugene as his newest worker.



"
Worth
"
[
]


Frankie and Tanya criticize Eugene's request for a sardine and mac n' cheese dish, with Tanya stating that she can't believe garlic was wasted for that dish. Later that day, she listens to Eugene's speeches about making enough bullets to aid Simon and Negan in the battle against the survivors.



"
Wrath
"
[
]


Frankie walks around with Amber and Tanya at the Sanctuary as the Saviors prepare for the final assault. After the war ends and Negan is defeated, Frankie starts to dress in normal clothing. She and Tanya greet 
Tara
 and 
Rosita
 at the Sanctuary when they arrive to fix the glass that was shattered 
previously
 by the 
Militia
.



Season 9
[
]


"
Scars
"
[
]


At least two years since the conclusion of the war against the Saviors, Frankie moved to 
Alexandria
 and adopted one of the Savior orphans, a young girl named 
Alice
. Having passed one year since Rick's assumed death, Frankie enjoys a bonfire with the other Alexandrians and the children in 
Jocelyn
's 
group
. The next morning, she, along with 
Scott
, 
Michonne
, and 
Jonah
's 
par
ents
, head over to the house where Jocelyn's group was staying to pick up their kids from a sleepover. 

After finding the house empty and the kids missing, Frankie and the other parents frantically search Alexandria. She checks the infirmary and finds it ransacked and informs Michonne of what she found just as they find 
Russ
 murdered by the pantry. The next morning, Frankie watches as Michonne and 
Daryl
 return to Alexandria with the kids. She immediately runs over to hug 
her daughter
.



"
The Calm Before
"
[
]


Frankie is among the Alexandria residents that assist the fair at 
the Kingdom.
 She watches from the crowd as 
Ezekiel
 declares they've finally accomplished 
Rick
, 
Carl
, and 
Jesus
' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. At the fair, Frankie and Alice ask a flustered 
Henry
 if he is looking for someone. 
"I hope you find them!"
 Frankie tells him as he continues his way around the fair. 

At some point later that day, Frankie is among the residents kidnapped by 
Alpha
 and taken away to a barn in the woods where they are about to be attacked by 
the Whisperers
 but are found by 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and 
D.J.
, giving the group a chance to fight back. During the fight, Frankie and 
Addy
 take down a Whisperer. In the middle of the chaos, Alpha arrives and the group is subdued. She then decapitates everyone as 
Siddiq
 is forced to watch, only leaving him alive as a witness. Frankie's decapitated head is later put by Alpha on one of the several pikes used for the Whisperers' border.

The next day, Daryl, Michonne, 
Carol
, Siddiq, and 
Yumiko
 find the border and watch in horror at the victims, a reanimated Frankie being among them. They then put down their zombified heads to properly rest. When the group returns to the Kingdom, Siddiq delivers the tragic news and narrates how Frankie and the others fought together as a family in their last moments. He finishes the story by encouraging everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.
