Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Jos√©'s life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Jos√© somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as a worker for the Sanctuary.



Season 8
[
]


"
The Big Scary U
"
[
]


Jos√©, along with 
Brooke
, 
Potter
, and many other workers confronts the Savior lieutenants, demanding power, water, and other amenities. He shouts that the young and old need water. When 
Negan
 starts whistling and makes his way toward the crowd, Jos√© and the others quickly take a knee.



"
Dead or Alive Or
"
[
]


Jos√© is among the workers from the Sanctuary sent to 
Eugene
's 
outpost
 to help produce bullets for Negan's army.



"
Worth
"
[
]


Jos√© is producing bullets with the other workers when he listens to Eugene's speech about meeting the minimum quota for Simon. When a soot-covered Eugene returns after his brief absence, Jos√© and the other Saviors are ordered to complete the entire bullet order in anticipation of Negan's final assault on the militia.



Season 9
[
]


"
Who Are You Now?
"
[
]


At some point following Rick's assumed death, the Sanctuary eventually falls as a community, with most of its residents integrating into Alexandria, Hilltop, and the Kingdom, however, Jos√© was one of the many residents to leave the Sanctuary and find safety on his own.
