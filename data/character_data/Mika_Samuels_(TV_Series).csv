,,,"Mika is a kind and compassionate girl. She is more mature than her older sister Lizzie, as she is able to calm her down when she gets distressed. Unlike Lizzie, Mika had no problem killing walkers, being able to recognize the danger, but was unable to bring herself to kill a living person. Her life was taken by her own sister who wanted to prove to Carol that walkers weren't dangerous.","Nothing is known about Mika's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had a 
father
, mother, and a 
sister
. She lived in Jacksonville, Florida, and mentioned that she enjoyed science class.","Mika joined the survivors at the 
West Georgia Correctional Facility
 with her father and sister sometime during the time skip between 
Seasons 3
 and 4. At some point in the outbreak, notably before the events of the time skip between Seasons 3 and 4, she lost her mother to the apocalypse.
Mika, along with the other prison children stand at the fences in the courtyard giving names and talking to 
walkers
. 
Carl Grimes
 and 
Patrick
 notice what the children are doing and Carl tells them they must not name walkers as they are not people, while Mika's sister, 
Lizzie
, argues with him in disagreement. After that, the children leave the courtyard to go read and Mika asks Patrick if he's coming to 
Carol Peletier
's storytime reading, which he answers yes. She is later seen at the library when Carol secretly teaches the children how to wield knives.
Mika is first seen when Carol brings her and Lizzie to talk with their father, Ryan, before he dies and then tries to calm Lizzie down as Carol stops Ryan from reanimating. Later she is seen with Lizzie when Carol comes over and explains that she is now looking after them like Ryan asked before Lizzie runs away crying due to Nick the walker being killed. Mika explains to Carol that Lizzie isn't weak just messed up. After this she is again with Lizzie when Carol comes to talk to her a second time.
Mika is seen holding 
Judith Grimes
 with 
Molly
. They, along with 
Luke
, are walking towards the bus when Lizzie approaches the four of them. Mika tells Lizzie they are going to the prison bus as planned. Lizzie then replies telling them that Carol wanted them to fight and to be strong. They proceed to get weapons. It is unknown at this point what Mika and Molly did with Judith. Mika and Lizzie are later seen shooting 
Alisha
 and an unnamed follower in order to save 
Tyreese Williams
. When Molly and Luke run off, Mika and her sister follow behind. Tyreese tells the kids they're going the wrong way, but then follows them.
Mika is shown to be traveling with Tyreese, Lizzie, and Judith. She tells Lizzie that she misses Carol, but Lizzie tells Mika Carol isn't here. Mika says that she's afraid. The four of them set up camp for the night. While Mika is with Judith and Tyreese, Lizzie is on her own on the other side killing rabbits. The following morning, Mika finds grapes for her and Lizzie to eat. Judith starts to cry and walkers are creeping in. Tyreese changes Baby Judith, and when birds fly by, Mika runs away into the forest because she was scared.
Tyreese finds her and tells her she did the right thing to run, but she has to run with the group and not alone. The four hear screaming. When Tyreese leaves Lizzie, Mika, and Judith alone, Judith starts crying and attracts walkers. Mika tries to shoot walkers approaching them when Lizzie can't hear her asking for help. Carol finds Mika and the girls and they meet with Tyreese. Mika finds a sign that says ""
Terminus
"".
Mika is seen sleeping on the tracks beside Tyreese while Carol is talking to Lizzie. While Carol is talking to Tyreese about Lizzie not understanding walkers and Mika being weak, Carol and Mika go off in search of water while Tyreese rests his injured arm. Carol implores Mika to toughen up. Mika insists she can kill walkers but won't kill people because it's wrong. Carol says Mika will die if she doesn't change. They discover a house in the middle of a pecan grove. Carol suggests they stay put for a couple of days.
Mika is sitting on the rails while holding Judith. Mika makes an attempt, that comes across as feeble, to persuade her sister Lizzie that walkers are not people, they're dead. After yelling at Lizzie, a walker stumbles out of the house and falls to the ground, the walker tries to bite Lizzie but Mika shoots it with her pistol three times, once in the shoulder, in the body and in the head finishing it off. Mika talks to Lizzie after she walks away, apologizing for yelling at her.
As they settle down in the house, Mika finds a doll, names it 'Griselda Gunderson' and sits on the floor in front of the fireplace and plays with it. She looks at Carol and Lizzie and says to Tyreese that they could live here. Later into the episode, Mika and Carol are walking in the forest hunting for deer. When Carol mentions the smoke in the air, Mika says that it's still burning as the smoke is not white. Mika says that she learned that in science class. As they approach a deer, Mika is about to hand her rifle to Carol but she tells her to shoot it as Carol thinks she is not strong enough. She aims her rifle at the deer but cannot pull the trigger and the deer walks away. Mika says to Carol that they still have peaches.
Later, Mika chases Lizzie as she runs away from the house and she catches Lizzie feeding a walker mice. They engage into another argument, Mika again fruitlessly attempting to tell Lizzie that walkers are not people. A few charred walkers approach from the forest and they run screaming, back to Carol and Tyreese and they all shoot at the approaching walkers. As they are sitting in the living room of the house, Mika again plays with her doll and helps Carol cook pecans.
Nearing the end of the episode when Tyreese and Carol are away talking, Lizzie murders Mika with a knife, claiming then to Carol and Tyreese that her sister will 'come back' because she did not damage her brain. After the incident, Tyreese and Carol discuss what to do with Lizzie. Tyreese made sure she didn't have knives or weapons. Tyreese discusses more disturbances with Lizzie, saying she butchered a rabbit near the tombs and nailed it to a board. He also found a shoebox full of mice in her room and speculated that she fed the walkers at the prison. After Carol kills Lizzie, Mika is buried alongside her sister, her reanimation prevented by Carol. Tyreese and Carol leave yellow flowers on the graves and Carol mourns the loss of both Lizzie and Mika. As Carol and Tyreese leave the cabin, Mika's doll that she played with before she died is seen.
Mika appears in a flashback after her death, wrapped in a white sheet along with her sister, about to be buried in the graves that Carol dug.
Mika, along with her sister, appears during a hallucination of Tyreese assuring him that ""It's better now"". Mika reappears with Lizzie after Tyreese has been bitten, now with their wounds (Mika with stabbing wounds and Lizzie with a gun shot wound). Mika, in a hallucination, lifts up Tyreese's arm which turns out to be Rick in preparation of removing it at an attempt of saving Tyreese. Finally, during the car journey at the end of the episode, Mika along with Lizzie, Bob, and Beth appear smiling and reassuring him that everything is going to be okay.
Carol looks at the cover of a textbook and hallucinates seeing herself at the head of a table with Mika, 
Sophia
, 
Lizzie
, 
Sam
, and 
Henry
 with blood over their necks sitting around the table.","Killed By
