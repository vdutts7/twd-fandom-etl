Overview
[
]


Earl is a flawed but good-hearted man. He is solemn, stoic, and calm, acting as 
Tammy
's rational side such as when she angrily confronts 
Maggie
, he attempts to calm her down. Before the outbreak, he had an 
alcohol problem
 but vowed to never drink again for his 
son
. After the death of his son, he becomes depressed and begins drinking again. 
Gregory
 takes advantage of this and manipulated Earl into trying to assassinate Maggie. After he fails to kill Maggie, Earl is imprisoned. He is shown to express remorse for his actions and is let go when Maggie sees how her father had a similar alcoholic problem.

6 years after Rick's assumed death, Earl is shown to have redeemed himself and became the full-time blacksmith for Hilltop. He acts as a wise mentor figure for 
Alden
 and later 
Henry
. When Henry is imprisoned for misbehavior, Earl is disappointed in him and at first tells him he won't teach Henry anymore. However, Earl remembers when he was also imprisoned and decides to give Henry a second chance like Maggie gave to him. Later, when a 
baby
 is taken from the 
Whisperers
, though initially hesitant on having another child, Earl decides to adopt the baby with Tammy, naming him Adam.

Earl becomes vengeful towards the Whisperers after the death of Tammy. When 
Mary
, a defecting Whisperer, enters Hilltop he is angered and refuses to let Mary see Adam, who is her nephew. After the battle at Hilltop, Earl manages to save many children. Unfortunately it is revealed he is bitten. Caring more about the kids than himself, he attempts to kill himself so he won't turn and be a threat to the kids.   



Pre-Apocalypse

[
]


Earl served in the Vietnam War and was stationed outside of Khe Sanh during his second tour. While patrolling the hills around the village, Earl and a friend of his discovered a cache of Soviet-made SKS carbines.

Two days later, Earl's garrison was attacked as part of the Tet Offensive and suffered 155 deaths.

At some point, Earl married 
Tammy
 and had a son with her, 
Ken
. He was an 
alcoholic
, to the point that he was drunk when Ken was born and can't even remember the first time he saw him. When Ken was two, Earl got into a fight with the babysitter and drove off with Ken, drunk. He later pulled over and called Tammy to pick them up. He expected his wife to leave him, but she didn't. From that day, Earl swore off drinking, staying sober for the next twenty years. 



Post-Apocalypse

Season 9
[

Content








When the community had democratic elections between Maggie and Gregory to elect a new leader, Earl was one of the residents who, despite not being convinced by Maggie's decisions to provide provisions to 
the Saviors
, voted for her after taking into account Gregory's ineptitude to be a leader.



"
A New Beginning
"


Upon being informed by 
Maggie
 of Kenneth's death, Earl remains in silent as an emotional Tammy scolds Maggie for getting her son killed, reminding her that she voted for her in the election. Earl tries to calm her down but Tammy doesn't listen and criticizes Maggie's decision to supply the Saviors. He then chooses to leave the room. During Kenneth's funeral, a heartbroken Earl listens as 
Alden
 sings and then as 
Gregory
 gives a eulogy. He then helps to place the lid on the coffin and prepare to bury his son.

Gregory then approaches Tammy and Earl with a bottle of whiskey. She drinks herself to sleep, leaving Earl and Gregory to talk, with Gregory breaking Earl's non-drinking policy and taking advantage of him. Through some cunning words, Gregory suggests to Earl that Maggie does not have to be in charge of Hilltop anymore. When Maggie rushes towards 
Glenn
's grave, she is attacked by a hooded and drunk Earl, who also knocks over 
Hershel
's stroller. 
Enid
 intervenes but gets pushed to the ground hard and is knocked out. Alden and 
Cyndie
 arrive and manage to stop Earl.

The next night, a restrained Earl watches from the crowd as Maggie gives a speech to the residents about the punishment in the community and then orders for Gregory to be executed by hanging to the shock of everyone.



"
The Bridge
"


Following Gregory's execution, Earl is imprisoned in Hilltop's cell as punishment for over a month. When Maggie allows Tammy to see her husband, she tells him she forgives him and claims that what he did was a mistake and he's a good and changed man. They talk a little about their past and Earl says he needs the forgiveness of Maggie. 

Later that day, Maggie talks to Earl herself. He mentions how he became an alcoholic, not remembering seeing his son for the first time and how an accident made him stop drinking for over twenty years. He says that despite being drunk he was aware of his actions and says he regrets trying to kill her. Eventually, Maggie releases him from his cell to pay his debt, since he made her remember how 
her father
 was an alcoholic too and got a second chance in life.



"
Evolution
"


Six years after 
Rick
's assumed death, Earl now acts as a full-time blacksmith and has taken Alden as his apprentice. When 
Michonne
 and 
Siddiq
 arrive at Hilltop with a group of newcomers, he looks on as they talk with 
Tara
 and Enid. Later that day, Earl is at his blacksmith tent and offers his new apprentice 
Henry
 an invitation to have dinner with him and Tammy that night but Henry politely rejects him after seeing Alden and Enid kissing.

That night, Tara takes Earl down to the jail where Henry sits in a cell as punishment for misbehavior. Feeling disappointed and betrayed, Earl tells him he will no longer teach him and to return to 
the Kingdom
. However, Henry explains his community is counting on him and begs for another chance. Earl then remembers that he once got spared too after his wrongful actions and promises to talk to 
Jesus
 when he returns.



"
Bounty
"


Earl is checked up by Enid for an injury and she suggests he retire, but he refuses. Tammy thanks Enid for helping and assures her Alden will turn up. When 
Alpha
 arrives outside the gates with a group of 
Whisperers
 to offer trading Alden and 
Luke
 for her captive daughter, Earl helps to look around the community for the missing 
Lydia
. 

When 
Connie
 runs out of the cornfield, sling-shots a walker, and saves a baby left by the Whisperers to be devoured by an approaching herd, Earl, Tammy, 
Daryl
, and 
Kelly
 step in to rescue her. At night, Earl and Tammy hold the baby and share a happy moment together, having decided to adopt the 
abandoned child
. 



"
Chokepoint
"


Earl is part of Tara's group in charge of clearing a tree from their path to the Kingdom to ensure the roads are cleared for Alden's convoy carrying the food and trade goods for the fair. While on the road, Earl tells Tammy not to get too attached to the baby as he deserves to be adopted by a younger couple.

Later that day, a small herd of walkers approaches the group. They get in position and remind themselves to watch for the Whisperers. Earl is almost bitten by a walker but is saved in time by Tammy. Suddenly, 
the Highwaymen
 ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara after helping to take down the herd. They then escort them to the Kingdom, having accepted 
Carol
's deal.

Upon arriving at the Kingdom, Earl and Tammy are greeted by 
Nabila
. She asks them about the baby and Tammy admits to Earl she wants to keep the baby with them. Earl smiles and embraces her.



"
The Calm Before
"


When the fair begins, Earl trades some of his blacksmithing work with some residents as Tammy carries her adopted son. They then walk around with their baby and talk about his new name. When Tammy suggests they should call him Adam, Earl jokingly mentions he had a friend in high school named 
Adam
 who was an asshole. Later that day, Earl looks around the fair for a missing Tammy with the help of Connie and Kelly.

The next day, Earl listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news about the fate of the missing fair attendees, tells them how brave the victims were in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.

"
Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Earl is among the coalition members drafted into the militia that was formed in response to the Whisperer threat. He and the other militia conduct a training exercise on the 
Oceanside
 beach. As 
Ezekiel
 and 
Jerry
 methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Earl and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat. 

They are successful and return to Oceanside to rest, eat, and socialize with the Oceansiders. That night, Earl helps put out the fire that was ignited in the woods in Whisperer territory after a satellite from outer space crashes.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Earl is alerted to the commotion of a tree falling onto a house and a portion of Hilltop's walls. When the group debates if the Whisperers are responsible, Earl yells that they are already at war. He then helps the other residents rescue the trapped injured from the rubble. 

The next day, Earl and the other residents kill the incoming walkers with the help of the Alexandria convoy when the herd invades the community that night. The following morning, Earl helps load the supplies onto the cart for the parting group towards Oceanside and watches as they leave the community.



"
What It Always Is
"


Earl helps out around the community following their recent attack and complains to 
Yumiko
 about their lack of retaliation against the Whisperers. Later that day, Earl tells Alden the Whisperers will eventually return while he claims he hasn't forgotten about what they had lost.



"
Morning Star
"


Earl and 
Alden
 are constructing defenses on the Hilltop's walls, when they spot a group of Alexandrians approaching, although neither recognize 
Mary
. When Earl asks Aaron about this, the latter reveals Mary to be a former Whisperer that has defected, and that she wishes to see her nephew, Adam. Earl promptly shoots down this notion, not trusting Mary. Alden agrees with Earl, and assures him that they will only allow the Alexandrians to see Alex.

Yumiko instructs Felix and Penny to radio them as soon as they see the Whisperers approaching. She then joins the discussion about what should be done. Lydia thinks they should run, explaining that even if the explosion at the cave took out half the horde, Alpha would still have thousands of walkers left. Earl thinks the Whisperers might bypass them and go for Alexandria first, but Lydia negates this. Jerry wishes to stay and fight instead, while Dianne agrees with Lydia, believing that they can rebuild in another location. Earl is skeptical, however, and reckons that they will never find a place as good as Hilltop. While Yumiko points out they're heavily outnumbered, Earl insists that fighting is the best course of action, and even if they die, they will die for a place that means something. Aaron points out that there are children at Hilltop, too. Daryl agrees that they should get the kids out first, and instructs the others to pack up and regroup at Oceanside.

As everyone is gathered on the front lines including Earl. Kelly puts her palms on the ground and confirms that the horde is close. Indeed, the horde soon emerges from the bushes and approaches the Hilltop. While they are momentarily halted by the electric fence, the walkers soon break through it and approach the second line of defense. Aaron orders the survivors to split ranks. The shield-wielding survivors reinforce the makeshift barbed wire fence, while the melee weapon-wielding survivors start taking out the walkers. The archers, meanwhile, stay in the back and rain arrows on the herd. Behind the herd, Beta commands the Whisperers to launch the sap they collected earlier using makeshift catapults into the front lines, drenching most of the defenders as well as the Hilltop's walls. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltop resident ablaze. With no choice, the defenders begin to retreat towards the Hilltop, but are trapped when the Whisperers launch another volley of fire-arrows into the Hilltop's walls, setting the community ablaze.



"
Walk With Us
"


Earl continues to participate in the battle to defend Hilltop. As the community falls, Earl finds 
Judith
 who has just killed a Whisperer and leads her and the other children to safety.

The next day, Earl and the children hole up in the 
Hilltop Cabin
 where Earl comforts the kids and promises that their parents will be there soon. Entering the next room, Earl drives a railroad spike through a table, having been bitten in the arm. Judith enters and realizes what happened with Earl explaining that he intends to kill himself before he can turn so that he won't be a threat to the children. Earl refuses Judith's offer to be at his side, stating that he won't be alone as he can now be with 
Tammy Rose
 and 
Ken
 while Alden will take care of 
Adam
. After Judith leaves the room, Earl braces himself and then slams his head against the spike.

Shortly afterwards, Judith enters the room to find Earl dead, but that he had failed at impaling himself on the spike. With his brain still intact, Earl reanimates and Judith quickly puts him down with her 
katana
. Arriving moments later with 
Ezekiel
 and 
Jerry
, 
Daryl
 finds Judith crying beside Earl's corpse and comforts her.
