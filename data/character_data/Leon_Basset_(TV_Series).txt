Overview
[
]


For a cop, Leon seems to be quite incompetent. While waiting for a car in a high-speed pursuit, Leon is shown to be unfocused, thinking about getting a chance to be on a TV show rather than the task at hand, to which 
Rick
 tells him to check if he has a round in the gun chamber and the safety off. Rick himself describes Leon as "
careless and dumb"
 when he sees Leon reanimated. However, Rick holds enough respect for Leon to put him down, not wanting to leave him as a 
walker
.

"
Days Gone Bye
"


On a highway, Leon and 
Lambert Kendal
 meet up with fellow officers, 
Rick Grimes
 and 
Shane Walsh
. As they all wait for the car, Leon muses about their chances of getting on a police chase reality show. Rick tells him to focus, and worry about having a round in his gun chamber and the safety off. Leon sheepishly checks his gun while Shane suggests that it would be 
"kinda cool gettin' on one of them shows."


At that moment, the car approaches, pursued by two more cruisers containing the 
Linden County Sheriff's Department
 officers. The car, with the suspects inside, speeds over the spike strip, shredding the tires. The driver loses control of the wheel and the vehicle flips off the road, rolling several times before coming to a rough stop upside down in a field. 
"Holy shit,"
 mutters Shane, cocking his 
shotgun
 as the officers descend on the vehicle.

Rick carefully approaches the overturned car. A 
man
 emerges from the vehicle and immediately starts shooting at the officers. Rick yells at him to drop his 
pistol
, but the man shoots directly at Rick and hits him in the chest. Shane shoots the gunman, killing him as Rick falls to the ground.

A 
second man
 emerges from the vehicle brandishing a shotgun, but is also shot to death. 
"I'm alright!"
 Rick shouts, the gunman having shot his Kevlar bulletproof vest. Shane approaches Rick as he pulls himself off the ground.
"Shane, you do not tell Lori that happened! Ever!"
 Rick commands Shane as he looks at his vest. 

Meanwhile, a 
third gunman
 unnoticed by everyone crawls out of the car and through the grass. The man fires his 
gun
 and hits Rick in the side, where his vest does not protect him. He falls to the ground bleeding as Shane shoots and kills the third man before rushing to Rick's aid. He begs for Rick to stay with him, barking at Leon to call an ambulance, but Rick remains motionless.
