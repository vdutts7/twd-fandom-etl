Overview
[
]


Simon is a ruthless, brutal, unpredictable, and articulate man with a sadistic and unnerving sense of humor, and is considered even by Negan too violent and "psychotic". Simon is also shown to be highly intelligent. He possesses a very impressive and detailed vocabulary he uses to both motivate and to terrify. He has displayed extreme loyalty to his leader, and as such is highly valued and trusted by him. Like Negan, Simon is not beyond using fear and intimidation to achieve his ends and is a remorseless, cold-blooded mass murderer and is not at all bothered by the excessive violence that the Saviors employ, as seen when Negan casually asked him for a pen to mark where he would cut 
Carl
's arm off. Simon simply grants Negan's request and shows no emotional reaction to the situation, which seems to imply that Simon has committed similar acts of brutality and has become desensitized to it and is even shown to take sadistic pleasure in the violence employed by the Saviors.    

As the second highest-ranking member of the Saviors, Simon held a large amount of power surpassed only by Negan himself, and also seemed to be a very capable leader and strategic thinker as he cleverly organized the capture and ambush of Rick's group by predicting which roads they would travel on and constructed barricades accordingly to lead them into an ambush.    

In spite of being Negan's most loyal follower, it is gradually revealed that the two drastically differ in their views on how to deal with disloyalty and defiance on the part of their subjugated communities. Unlike Negan who chooses to kill a few to save many and get others back in line, Simon is shown to be even more bloodthirsty and is willing to destroy entire groups due to their disobedience to the Saviors, as seen when he had the 
Scavengers
, except for 
Jadis
, exterminated due to their betrayal of the Saviors for siding with 
Rick
 and Jadis' lack of remorse.

He is not bothered causing harm to children or the elderly as proven by a comment to 
Rick
 in which he claimed that Carl was not punished hard enough for killing two Saviors in an attempt to kill Negan. Simon also executed the elderly 
Brion
 without any hesitation, and had adolescent members of the Scavengers massacred. It is also confirmed that he had all the male survivors above the age of 10 from the 
Oceanside
 
slaughtered
 after they initiated a rebellion against the Saviors, something that even shocked Negan himself. Negan later expressed regret for not killing Simon himself after this sick and twisted act and giving Simon a second chance instead. Simon is shown to be a hypocrite about this, angrily berating 
the Croat
 for crossing the line and torturing a 
kid
 to death despite Simon's own massacre of all males over the age of ten at Oceanside. However, he may have been doing this to win points with Negan as Simon is shown kissing up to Negan and trying to angle for more power for himself in place of the Croat.

In 
Season 7
, at the command of Negan, he assumes direct responsibility for the continued subjugation of the 
Hilltop Colony
 after the 
elimination
 of 
one of the Saviors' outposts
 and takes pleasure in terrorizing both the Hilltop and 
Alexandria
 when called upon to do so. He has demonstrated and verbally expressed his admiration for authoritarian leaders, and those who "lead by example", something which he himself puts into practice with his uncompromising methods, and strict obedience to Negan. He retains this even into Season 8, respecting 
Gregory
 enough despite his failures to include Gregory into Simon's failed coup.

During 
Season 8
 and the war, Simon begins and eventually lost patience for Negan's methodology of only killing when an example is to be made. While Negan believes it to be a principle of the Saviors to ultimately unite communities and only resort to violence to keep people in line, Simon believes the Saviors should simply kill off all of the communities that oppose them and instead only spare communities completely loyal to them. Shortly after having this disagreement with Negan, Simon travels to the Heaps and eventually orders his men to gun down the Scavengers. Simon merely grins in satisfaction as he watches unarmed men, women and even children get killed on his orders, displaying how little Simon values concepts such as morality or mercy, while at the same time defying Negan's orders. He subsequently lied to Negan about this instead of owning up to his actions. Upon Negan being kidnapped by Jadis, Simon takes advantage of the situation to assume leadership over the Saviors and manipulates them all into destroying the Hilltop for Negan, even though this is directly against Negan's wishes. Simon is even shown to be willing to sacrifice his own fellow Saviors in his quest to exterminate his enemies as seen before he launches his attack on the Hilltop in which he makes it clear that he does not care about the 38 Savior prisoners that 
Maggie
 has inside and is willing to sacrifice them in order to launch his assault. Simon demonstrates during this conflict that his ruthlessness and desire for blood has completely overclouded his once adept strategic thinking as he leads his people up against machine guns with bows and arrows and tainted walker weapons and as a result loses nearly half of his soldiers and quickly retreats, showing that he also has cowardly tendencies. 

Upon Negan's return and him humiliating Simon in front of the rest of the council and learning of Negan's next plan of action, Simon reaches the end of his tether and attempts to lead a coup in order to get rid of Negan for good, showing that all respect he had for his leader is now gone and that he is desperate to take over the Saviors. Ultimately, Simon's thirst for blood and desire to both exterminate his enemies and take command of the Saviors would lead to his own demise. And it is at the hands of his leader and closest ally, the man who once considered him his most loyal and valuable follower.

Years after Simon's death, after hearing about the war from 
Jerome
, the Croat tells Negan that he can only imagine just how much damage Simon had caused. The Croat claims that Simon had never really listened to Negan like Simon had always seemed to, suggesting that Simon was always disloyal to at least some degree and only seeking his own power despite Simon supposedly being one of Negan's most faithful and loyal followers at one time. Although Simon and the Croat had a very poor relationship in general, the Croat recognized this disloyalty in the other man long before Simon actually tried to take over the Saviors for himself.



Pre-Apocalypse

Virginia
[
]


Simon grew up in Virginia, however, extensively little is known regarding that of his early life. Simon grew to become a charismatic, efficient and hardworking man, (but not without an aggressive side) who sold subprime mortgages to unsuspecting customers without their knowledge while lying about his intentions and was fully able to justify his immoral motives to other people even though he was fully aware of his own sinister intentions.
[1]




Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point after the onset of the outbreak, Simon discovered an abandoned factory, where some survivors lived and thus he joined the group. Because of their incapable leader, Simon came into contact with Negan and subsequently joined his group named "The Saviors". At some point later, Negan along with Simon's and other Saviors' help managed to seize control over the group from the previous leader and established the factory as their central headquarters as well as their personal home which became titled "
The Sanctuary
".
[2]
 The two also developed a firm loyalty towards each other and thus Negan later appointed Simon as his personal second-in-command.
[3]
 Their group eventually grew to contain well over 600 survivors.

Shortly after Negan took charge over the factory and appointed Simon as his right-hand man, he learned that previously Simon and his men had encountered a 
group
 of survivors and thus enslaved them and forced them to work under their rule. Eventually the group attempted to fight back but they were overwhelmed and defeated. As punishment for their defiance, Simon had every single male above the age of 10 
exterminated
; something that Negan did not approve of at all. The surviving female survivors later fled 
their settlement
 and disappeared to a new location. After Negan heard about Simon's orchestration of the massacre and despite being his most loyal follower, Negan kept a close eye on Simon since then due to his brutal nature, disobedience of certain orders and possibility of being a threat in the future because of what he is capable of.

Throughout the following months, Simon aided his leader in terrorizing other survivors and communities they encountered into subjugating to Negan's will; during where he committed several brutal atrocities in order to do so, including murdering innocent people, displaying gruesome acts to implement superiority and fear to other survivors, as well as orchestrating several raids and ambushes to whoever opposed them.
[4]


At some point after discovering the 
Hilltop Colony
, they demanded half of their supplies in exchange for leaving the farming community unscathed, demonstrating their methods and bringing their intentions to light by executing 
Rory
, a 16-year-old member of the colony.
[5]
 Roughly during the same period, the Saviors discovered another community known as 
the Kingdom
 where upon meeting with the community leader they demanded a portion of supplies to be produced in exchange for leaving the community unscathed.

During this period, Simon often clashed with 
the Croat
, one of Negan's highest-ranking lieutenants and the interrogator of the Saviors. The Croat's methods proved to be too extreme for even Simon while, in return, the Croat had an extremely low opinion of Simon and believed that, despite apparently being one of Negan's most faithful and loyal followers, Simon wasn't actually truly loyal to him and never really listened to Negan. Simon used the Croat's extreme actions to angle for more power for himself and less for the other man and berated the Croat for brutally torturing and murdering 
a young girl
 despite his own hypocrisy about not harming kids. The torture and murder of the young girl led Negan to try to kill the Croat who escaped with his right ear 
blown off
. The Croat's escape solidified Simon's position as Negan's undisputed second-in-command.

"
Everybody Wins a Prize
"


In a flashback, 
Negan
 sits at a table full of food in the 
Sanctuary
, 
Lucille
 sitting in a nearby chair. Negan sketches what appears to be plans for the Sanctuary's walker fence, before being interrupted by Simon with the news that they have a problem. Simon leads Negan, carrying Lucille, to a cell, telling his boss that he'd 
"told him to kibosh that shit. Said you gave the order, but you know he don't listen to me."
 While Simon isn't going to say I told you so, a lot of people are saying that it's time to reign 
the Croat
 in, suggesting that Negan invest more authority in someone like himself.

The Croat leads Negan and Simon into the cell, telling them that the girl confessed that she was sent by the 
King
, just like he thought. Simon reminds the Croat that Negan had given a direct order to let the girl go, but the Croat states that his process takes time, reminding Simon that he'd determined the location of the hidden arms cache at 
the Hilltop
. Simon is sure that he would've found it eventually and Simon argues with the Croat as Negan looks in horror at 
the Kingdom
 
scout
 - just a young girl - who has been brutally tortured to death by the Croat and then stabbed in the head in order to keep her from reanimating. Simon calls the Croat 
"a Slavic, psychopathic, 
nut job
"
 and - despite his own 
hypocrisy
 in the matter - angrily confronts the other 
Savior
 over harming kids which is a line that they don't cross. The Croat appeals to Negan for understanding as they had to be sure.

Sometime later, Simon led a group of Saviors on a hunt for Rick Grimes' people, following several attacks that left many Saviors dead. They soon discovered a small group of survivors who had taken refuge in the Viskocil Public Library; the Saviors soon terrorized the group by implementing their strict rules upon them. However, after the group retaliated, the Saviors hanged the member who first initiated the firefight inside a tower before ruthlessly executing each member of the group and allowing them to reanimate. One survivor managed to evade their attacks and escape, prompting the Savior party to chase after him.



"
Last Day on Earth
"


Simon is first seen when he and his small party of Saviors hunt down a 
man
 in the woods, following an attack staged by the Saviors on the lone survivor's group. He drags the man from the woods to a road, where he and the other Saviors stand and create a roadblock, waiting for 
Rick Grimes
' group to arrive. He stands over the captured man and taunts Rick and his crew in their RV as they pull up. Asking for their belongings on behalf of the Saviors, the leader states that negotiations cannot be made and that their proposal stands, prompting the Alexandrians to return to their RV and take an alternate route to the Hilltop. Before they leave, Rick and Simon discuss the possibilities of their days on Earth being their last, with the latter warning Rick that he should be "extra nice to those people in [the] RV", should their days on Earth be numbered.

After a number of subsequent roadblocks en route to the Hilltop, the Alexandrians come across yet another barrier created with fallen trees. They witness the Saviors' prisoner's execution as he is hanged with a chain over the side of an overpass, before the roadblock is set ablaze and Simon reminds Rick to look after his people with utmost care. This display startles the Alexandrians, and they make a quiet retreat in search of another route.

Following a failed diversion by Rick's group, Simon greets them after they find themselves surrounded and outnumbered by dozens of Saviors in a small clearing in the woods. Once again demanding their belongings, he declares that the time for negotiations is now over and that the Alexandrians are simply required to listen. Simon lines the group up on their knees before commanding Dwight to present the captured search party (
Glenn Rhee
, 
Daryl Dixon
, 
Michonne Hawthorne
 and 
Rosita Espinosa
). All are brought together in the line-up before Simon introduces Negan to the group.

As Negan paces up and down the line-up, Simon points Rick out as the leader of the Alexandrians after he enquires. He is present for the entirety of Negan's monologue, alongside Dwight and the rest of the Saviors, and watches as Negan gruesomely beats one of Rick's group to death with 
Lucille
.

"
The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
"


After Negan kills 
Abraham
 and 
Glenn
, he asks Simon what weapons Rick had with him. Simon reveals that Rick was carrying a hatchet with him. Simon is seen giving Rick's hatchet to Negan after he orders him to, further proving his loyalty to his leader. Negan reveals to Rick that Simon is his right-hand man, and without him, there would be a whole lot of work. Simon stays behind and watches the survivors of Rick's group as Negan grabs Rick by his shirt and drags him inside the RV.

After Negan returns with Rick in the RV and calls Carl to him Negan asks Simon for a pen to which Simon replies that he does and tosses him a pen to draw on Carl's arm. After Negan succeeds in breaking Rick and taking Daryl captive, he and the rest of the Saviors take their leave.



"
Go Getters
"


Simon is shown leading a group of Saviors into the 
Hilltop
. Gregory opens the door for Simon and the other Saviors at Hilltop. He tells them to make themselves at home, and Simon says it isn't a social call. He tells Gregory they should talk in private. Simon tells Gregory that the people he used to deal with are out of play, and takes him into the study.

Simon and Gregory are staring at a painting. Simon tells him they unleashed the walkers on the Hilltop to remind its residents that walkers are still a threat and the Saviors provide a great service by killing them. Gregory said the message last night was received loud and clear, and Simon questions him. He says it was management by example, and Gregory agrees. Simon says they worked their asses off last night to provide him with an example. Simon says people in Hilltop probably forget what the walkers look and smell like, and they were going to clean up the mess so they could show the service they provide. Gregory says they probably learned it all from the Saviors in the first place.

Simon informs Gregory that the Saviors at the 
Satellite Outpost
 were killed by Rick and the people of Alexandria, but Gregory pretends this is news to him, and Simon says the people that killed them work for Negan now. Gregory tells Simon to tell Negan that he understands how to cross the aisle. Simon says there's no need, and that he is Hilltop's Negan now. The two come to an understanding. Simon asks if there's anything else he should be made aware of, and Gregory stays silent. "Actually, there is." says Gregory. 

He leads Simon to the foyer closet and opens it with the intention of handing over Maggie and Sasha. Instead, he finds boxes of scotch. Simon says Negan will be pleased and orders a nearby Savior to put the liquor in Negan's truck.

He then has the Saviors go through the entire house and take half of their supplies. He also notes that he will take the painting. Simon asks Gregory to kneel before they continue, and Gregory instantly does with little resistance. Simon tells him it's a solid kneel, and pats his head like a child. He and the Saviors leave.



"
Rock in the Road
"


When Negan discovers that 
Daryl
 escaped the Sanctuary and murdered 
Fat Joey
, he orders an operation to track, capture and kill Daryl by visiting Alexandria, his assumed destination. Simon immediately volunteers to lead the mission. He later arrives with a group of a dozen Saviors, moments after Rick's group returns to Alexandria. Rick innocently wonders why they are back so soon for tribute. Simon tells him they're looking for Daryl.

The Saviors ransack Alexandria, but come up empty. Simon notes that the pantry shelves are bare. Aaron explains that they're having a hard time scavenging, and Simon mocks the community. As the Saviors leave, he apologizes for messing the place, and hops in a truck. Before driving off, he tells Rick that if Daryl shows up here there is no statute of limitations on the punishment and that the next supply pick-up is nearing. "Tick-tock, chop-chop!" he reminds Rick.



"
The Other Side
"


Simon and his men returned to the Hilltop Colony for a quick visit. While there, Gregory takes Simon in the medical trailer, Simon tells 
Harlan Carson
 that they need his services at the Sanctuary. Harlan correctly guesses that his brother, 
Emmett Carson
, the Sanctuary's former doctor, was killed. In exchange for taking Harlan, Simon gives Gregory a crate of aspirin.

Gregory pulls Simon aside and assures him that he's an ally to Negan. He explains that he needs to hold on to his people's trust; otherwise, someone less cooperative (Maggie) could take over. He hints that he might eventually need Negan's help quelling insurgents within the community. Simon gives Gregory a hand-written note that will grant him entry into the Satellite Outpost should he ever need to seek their help. The Hilltop residents gather at the gates and watch Simon and the Saviors leave with Harlan Carson.

Later, Simon and his men arrived at the Sanctuary with Carson and introduces him to Negan, who walked out to greet the new doctor. Simon witnessed Negan giving Eugene a walkie talkie and it is clear that Simon is very skeptical of Eugene. He walks back inside the Sanctuary with Negan and the other Saviors. 



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"


Simon is among the men out on the road to inspect the fallen trees blockade and as several Saviors are clearing them out, he asks Negan the possibility of Rick and his group doing it to delay them. After 
the Scavengers
 have betrayed the Alexandrians, Simon is seen with 
Dwight
 and 
Eugene
 with dozens of other Saviors listening to Negan's monologue to Rick. He and Dwight are later instructed by Negan to lift up the coffin. As Negan opens the coffin, Sasha emerges a walker and tackles Negan, nearly killing him, but is pulled off by 
Roy
 who is then killed by the reanimated Sasha. Simon then quickly runs to Negan's aid and brings him to cover as Negan roared at his opponents.

After the Saviors have seemingly won the battle, Simon is present among the group of Saviors inside Alexandria as Rick and Carl are lined up and as Negan is about to hit 
Carl
 with 
Lucille
, 
Shiva
 is released by 
Ezekiel
 and jumps on a Scavenger, catching all of them off guard and another commotion ensures as Simon and the rest begin to retreat and find cover. Due to the overwhelming forces of 
Alexandria
, 
the Kingdom
 and 
Maggie
's troops from the 
Hilltop
, Simon hops back into the truck he drove in on, along with Negan and Dwight, and drives them away from the battle, making their retreat. Back at the Sanctuary, Simon, Dwight and Eugene are standing on a podium alongside Negan in front of hundreds of Saviors as Negan tells them they're going to war as chants "Yes Sir!".

"
Mercy
"


When the 
Militia
 arrives at the Saviors' compound, Simon was seen among the rest of the Savior lieutenants as Rick and the Militia attempted to convince them to surrender. Simon calls Gregory outside where he states that the Hilltop stands with the Saviors and threatens anyone who stands with the Militia from the Hilltop. However, the Hilltop members make it clear that they don't see Gregory as their leader anymore but Maggie. An enraged Simon pushes Gregory down the stairs after deciding he's no longer useful. Rick then opens fire at Negan and the lieutenants. Simon quickly dove for cover and retreated inside.



"
The Big Scary U
"


Simon is first seen in a flashback with 
Gregory
. He mentions how he came to him when he needed him and Simon complaints him how he did what he was told with the other Saviors. Gregory was going to reveal the alliance between the Hilltop and the Kingdom, but Simon was "finding out at that point" from someone in Alexandria according to Gregory. Later, Simon is in the meeting that was mentioned by Negan in "Mercy" they discuss how people are resources and how they are going to stop Rick and the Militia.

Simon suggests a strong raid on the Hilltop, which could end in killing everyone there if they don't cooperate, which would send a message to the other communities. Negan disagrees with him saying, "People are a resource," "Money on the table. People are the foundation of what we are doing here!" He questions Simon and if he remembers who they are and who is in charge. Simon pledges his allegiance. Negan says they have to capture Maggie, Rick and Ezekiel and kill them horribly in front of their people. Suddenly, The Militia's gunshots ring out outside. Negan pauses and looks out the window to see Rick and his group are outside the door, he steps out with the other Saviors.

In the present, Simon is in the room with 
Gavin
, 
Regina
, 
Dwight
, and 
Eugene
 as they have another meeting. Regina mentions how if Negan is dead and they should send workers to distract the walkers while they alert the outposts, Eugene refuses to do that, as he insists they are valuable. Dwight agrees and says to Simon that if they are not gonna lead the Saviors out, he will. Simon has an angry grin on his face and complaints Dwight about his idea he explains how when the find the guy they will kill the guy slowly in front of everyone. Simon is seen in another scene where 
Laura
 comes in the room and says the workers are outside.

Simon and the rest of the lieutenants step out and he orders everyone to go to the factory floor. At first the workers refuse to listen to his order and ask the Lieutenants when the electricity is coming on, as well as plead for food and water. As Simon attempts to calm them down, one of the workers pulls out a gun to shoot him, but is saved when Regina immediately guns down the worker. Negan and Gabriel walk in, explaining how he is gonna take a shower, eat a sandwich and he has to have a "talk" with Simon about the 
mole
 who caused the ambush and the herd.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


Simon first appears when he and the Saviors apprehend Maggie, Jesus and a large convoy of Hilltop residents. Simon jumps out of the truck and states what a "damn nice night" it is. He orders Maggie and all Hilltop members for their weapons, and to coordinate he threatens Maggie if she doesn't, they will kill 
Jerry
, who has been taken hostage.

Maggie asks Simon how the Saviors managed to escape their predicament. Simon doesn't respond directly, but eventually explains that it was Eugene who made it all happen as music begins to play from a distance, stating he was skeptical about the man at the beginning but saw that Eugene proved himself worthy in the end. 

Simon tells Maggie that a group of Saviors is taking over the Kingdom, and another is taking over Alexandria. He says that she's lucky because the Hilltop is useful and he will keep them alive to help make things right. He also says that Negan prefers to keep people alive, but he is concerned only with the result and will not hesitate to kill them even if he is disobeying him.

He then gives Maggie two choices; either the Saviors kill Jerry on his knees, drag Maggie to the Hilltop in the wooden box, which the Saviors have made sure won't suffocate whoever is in it, then kill Maggie in front of everyone and finally place her head in front of the Sanctuary as a warning to other troublemakers. Then the Saviors lead the walker herd to the Hilltop and pull off the same trick Rick and Maggie's people tried to do against the Saviors. Or, Maggie and her convoy can head back to the Hilltop, unharmed, however, with the cost of one of their people's lives.

Even if she cooperates, they will have to kill one of her people. Simon stops Gary from killing Jerry and Simon then kills 
Neil
 sitting in the backseat of her car. She says she will cooperate but asks him one favor first. She wants to borrow the box that he was going to use on her so that she can bury Neil. He grants her favor and leaves.



"
The Lost and the Plunderers
"


Simon is ordered by Negan to confront the 
Scavengers
, but to only deliver the standard message: kill one of their own to force the others to fall in line. Simon lets his frustration show and suggests they cut their losses and kill them all, because Negan's way hasn't been working as of late. Negan doesn't like the idea. He reminds Simon that what they do is hard, they don't take the easy way, they save. Once he kills Rick, everyone will fall in line again.

Their conversation is interrupted when Gary enters with a gift from Hilltop: a wooden coffin containing the zombified 
Dean
 who Maggie killed. Negan puts him down. Furious, Simon realizes that the remaining 38 Saviors mentioned on the crate cover are his men from the Satellite Outpost. Simon sounds off about going to kill every last one of the Hilltoppers, but Negan screams and yells at him to "do your job." Simon reluctantly agrees.

Simon shows up with a group of Saviors at the 
Heaps
 to confront 
Jadis
 and the Scavengers. His composure begins to crack as he and his men stand off against the Scavengers. He relays Negan's message of forgiveness: As long as Jadis can honor the original terms of their deal, all will be swept under the rug. Jadis says she had no deal with Rick but was, instead, delivering him. Simon angrily calls out her lie, but continues to deliver the standard message while struggling to maintain his composure. He states that Negan will forgive the Scavengers as long as they agree to the terms provided, but the Saviors need to confiscate their guns as a result of their betrayal. Jadis agrees and Simon calls for his men to take the guns. Simon goes on to question Jadis' art and the choice of living in the Heap. 

Simon then wants to feel assured that there is remorse on Jadis' part for her role in aiding Rick. She claims there is, but he swiftly pulls out his gun and kills 
Brion
 and 
Tamiel
. Jadis punches Simon in the face, knocking over a can of blue paint. Simon stands up and in retaliation has his men kill all of the Scavengers. Jadis watches her people getting wiped out in horror as Simon sadistically smiles.

Simon returns to the Sanctuary with Negan waiting outside. They still haven't heard from Gavin, who are unaware that he is dead, but Negan already sent a team. Simon shows Negan the guns they took from the Scavengers. Negan asks how it went with the Scavengers. Simon lies and tells Negan the message was delivered simply. Simon looks down at the paint smudge on his boots, the only clue to what really happened at the Heaps.



"
The Key
"


Simon is seen collecting walker guts with the rest of the Saviors. After they are finished loading the guts into the trucks, he tells Dwight to ride up with him to catch him up on the plan. On their way to the Hilltop, Simon questions Dwight's perspective of it. Dwight supports it, but Simon wants to "get weird" and honest. He questions whether or not the Hilltop will ever actually fold and behave but Dwight deflects by saying he doesn't get paid to think. It prompts Simon to express his doubts of the desired outcome.

Suddenly, Rick rams his car into Negan's car, then chases him down city streets. Simon instructs the rest of the Saviors to stay behind and set up a perimeter while he and Dwight search for Negan.

Simon and Dwight search for Negan. Simon presses Dwight into admitting his resentment of Negan. Dwight sarcastically says that he never thought about killing Negan even after he took his wife and burned his face. Simon expresses a desire to move on from Rick's group and find new communities. Simon and Dwight find Negan's wrecked car. They decide to abandon their search and return to the Saviors. Dwight lights the car on fire.

Simon and Dwight inform the Saviors about Negan's whereabouts once they return without him, and announce that they couldn't find him and that the best course of action is to presume him dead. Simon then manipulates the Saviors with a speech: it doesn't matter if Negan is with them or not, the Saviors are all "Negan". Simon declares that although they were going to carry out Negan's original plan, they should instead avenge Negan by taking out the Militia once and for all after Rick's personal ambush on Negan, regardless if Negan survived or not, since they still won't learn from the Saviors' punishments, and the Saviors must accept that fact. The Saviors raise their guns in solidarity.

Do Not Send Us Astray
"


Simon and the Saviors arrive at the Hilltop. Simon notices she has barricaded and orders his Saviors to move the blockade. Maggie radios to him and Simon informs her that Negan received her care package in the box which he gave to her. He tells her she and her people are gonna die because of it. Maggie tells him she will execute the thirty-eight Savior prisoners if he does not leave. Simon does not appear to care for them anymore and tells her to "screw them" and he proceeds with his attack.

Simon mobilizes the Saviors for battle. Dwight warns that Negan might still be alive and will punish Simon if he kills everyone at Hilltop. Simon dismisses Dwight by saying "Better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission". Suddenly, Daryl rides up on his motorcycle and opens fire with his machine gun. Simon's convoy follows Daryl through the gate. Hilltoppers block the convoy with a bus and fire at the Saviors. The battle begins in earnest. The Saviors start firing back, striking several people with mucked up arrows.

Simon spots Tara and orders Dwight to hunt her down. Simon and Dwight both sneak up on Tara while she's distracted. Simon is about to kill her, but Dwight shoots Tara in the arm with an arrow.

Hilltop goes silent and dark. Simon now wants to go inside and "do some proper slaughtering." He starts to whistle as they prepare to enter the Barrington House. As they ready their attack, a row of headlights turn on and blind the Saviors as the house's windows light up with gunfire directed at the Saviors. Angered that his plan is failing, Simon orders everyone to retreat as they race to their trucks though their escape is further impeded by the arrival of 
Rick Grimes
 and multiple Militia members, who kill several more Saviors. Simon manages to avoid Rick's attack and he and the remaining Saviors flee from the Hilltop.

Despite receiving heavy casualties from their assault, Simon and his men successfully infect many members of the Militia, unexpectedly causing them to reanimate and kill more people from within the Hilltop. In the ensuing chaos, Gregory, Jared and many of the Satellite Outpost prisoners escape from the Hilltop.



"
Worth
"


Simon meets with 
Gregory
 who tries to convince Simon that what happened with the Hilltop isn't his fault. Simon informs Gregory that he is now in charge of the Saviors due to Negan being presumed dead, and expresses that he wishes to maintain his control without Gregory's help, and wants him to leave due to seeing him as a liability. Gregory congratulates Simon on becoming the leader of the Saviors, but begins to arrogantly criticize him, seeing that the Saviors are unable to advise Simon on how to manage different communities and resources, while telling Simon that he can.

Due to Gregory's botched plan to split the Hilltop numbers from the Militia through threats of eviction, which resulted in Simon feeling humiliated, Simon firmly states that their partnership has ended and doesn't need him anymore. Gregory angrily talks Simon down, ranting that Simon hasn't got what it takes to keep things managed around the Sanctuary and gloats that he has the leadership that Simon doesn't, which provokes Simon into violently throwing him to the floor. Simon explains that he had contemplated killing Gregory upon seeing him turn up to the Sanctuary again, but changes his mind and allows Gregory to work under him, but only to start him off by having Gregory make coffee to see how it lasts.

After 
Negan
's unexpected return, Simon is forced to fall back into line, but is visibly unhappy with Negan's new plan. Simon apologizes for the disaster at Hilltop and asks for forgiveness. Negan reminds Simon of the time they took the Sanctuary as well as Simon's actions against Oceanside. Negan forces Simon to his knees and contemplates killing him with 
Lucille
, but suddenly forgives Simon. Simon later approaches 
Dwight
 with the intention to lead a coup against Negan. Dwight reluctantly agrees to meet with Simon's loyal followers in the courtyard and join the coup.

In the courtyard, Simon makes his pitch to a group of Saviors, including 
Gary
, Gregory and Dwight. Everyone agrees to join Simon, who decides to allow Dwight to kill Negan as Dwight has the biggest grudge against Negan. Suddenly, Negan arrives, having been tipped off by Dwight. Gary and Simon's followers are killed and Simon is shocked and angered by Dwight's betrayal, leading Dwight to simply claim that Negan would win. Negan angrily reprimands him for the massacre of the 
Scavengers
. Despite this and his backstabbing, Negan offers him a chance of leadership of the Saviors by fighting to the death.

Inside the Sanctuary, the Saviors form a circle around Negan and Simon as they prepare for their fight. Simon publicly brags that after the fight is finished, they will get back to work. He further explains that he didn't want it to come to this, but is willing to do what he needs to do to keep their community standing, and states that Negan is incapable of doing so. However, Simon suddenly punches Negan in the middle of his speech and the two engage in a brutal fist fight.

Simon initially gets the upper hand before Negan eventually overpowers him. He then strangles Simon to death, all the while furiously berating his right-hand man for ruining what chance they had left of making peace with Rick and the rest of the communities, asserting that he'll now have to kill them all just like he's killing Simon right now. Afterwards, Negan gives one final squeeze that crushes Simon's windpipe, killing him instantly. Everyone watches in silence as Negan simply states "What an asshole."

Following Simon's death, he reanimates as a walker and is chained to the 
Sanctuary
 fence.



"
Wrath
"


Following the end of the war, the walkers are cleared from the Sanctuary fence, including Simon and are all presumably put down. By the time 
Rosita
 arrives to help rebuild, there are no signs of any of the fence walkers.

The following is a list of some of Simon's most memorable quotes.





Season 6




"No... but that is a good thing to bring up. Think about it. What if it's the last day on earth for you? Or someone you love? What if that's true? Maybe you should be 
extra nice
 to those people in that RV cuz you never know... 
(snaps his fingers)
 Just like that. Be kind to each other. Like you said, like it was your 
last day on earth.
"
- Simon threatening Rick about the upcoming demise of one of his companions, "
Last Day on Earth
"





"Good! You made it! Welcome to 
where you're going!
 We'll take your weapons... 
(draws his gun)
 Now! (…) We're done talking, 
time to listen
."
- Simon upon encircling 
Rick's group
 in the clearing, "
Last Day on Earth
"





Season 7




"We need to talk. And it's getting a little... claustrophobic in here, right... let's talk in your study, I wanna see that painting... can't remember who told me about it but I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter much anymore... don't know if you heard what happened.... (…) Well those people you used to deal with, our brothers and sisters in arms in operation, well they've been removed from the field of play... (…) A-ha... I think you know what it means... 
It means we need to talk!
"
- Simon before taking 
Gregory
 into the study to have a private chat, "
Go Getters
"





"Wow, these are some bare shelving units. You guys have a barbecue or something and not invite us? 
Seriously
! This is sad. Hope you're not trying to hide stuff from us 'cause that generally doesn't go over very well. (…) Awww, relax! We're not here for pickup! Good thing! But that day is coming so you best do whatever you need to! Dig deep, go the extra mile, 
take some risks
!"
- Simon after seeing 
Alexandria
's empty shelving, "
Rock in the Road
"





Season 8




"Nah Gary! I got this! (…) I just really needed you to know what I was talking about. I need you to smell it. Now tell me, I don't gotta kill this gent with the lustrous mane, tell me I don't have to go down the line. 
TELL ME MAGGIE
!"
- Simon threatening 
Maggie
 after he killed 
Neil
, "
How It's Gotta Be
"





"It occurs to me I have to me that I've not received the full definition of an apology. I feel like I've gotten trangression acknowledgement, the guns certainly cover restitution, what I'm not yet feeling is the 
remorse
. (…) 
SAY IT AGAIN
! (…) Oh no no no! I don't think you mean that! Light it up gents. 
LIGHT IT UP NOW
!"
- Simon ordering for the 
Scavengers
 to be gunned down, "
The Lost and the Plunderers
"





"Damn right you are! We all are! Negan's plan was to go onto Hilltop and put the fear of 
God
 in these people so that finally once and for all they get with the program. After what just happened, that tells me that what we need is 
beyond them
! It's time we come to accept that. We must 
expunge
 them! We must 
redact
 them! They are a mistake, that we shall now 
erase
. We are moving on. 
FOR NEGAN
! 
YES
!"
- Simon to Dwight about wanting to become the leader of the Saviors, "
The Key
"





"If you're here right now, you're 
in
. We can talk about approaches and finesses, but you are 
in
. No take backs. We need to make this quick, quiet, and 
respectful
. Man's done a lot for us, he deserves that. 
You
 have some legitimate personal issues with the man. The kill is yours if you want it. Something quiet. I mean not a knife, can't make it that personal. Silencer? We call a meeting, and that's it. The next order of business is to set the brake to start the healing. The catalyzing event to facilitate that is the 
destruction
 of the Hilltop and its residents will make it a monument of compliance. Sorry Gregory. And then, we'll get on with our lives. Right Dwight?"
- Simon to the Saviors about killing Negan, "
Worth
"





Season 1: Dead City




"He said to let her walk. He gave a direct order. (…) Your process? (…) I would've found that shit. (…) The blah blah blah, this is what I'm talking about Negan. Using these highfalutin words to cover up what we all know you really are. A Slavic, psychopathic 
nutjob
. (…) Kids? 
KIDS
... is a line we do not cross. We all know that."
- Simon arguing with the Croat, "
Everybody Wins a Prize
"

Trivia
[
]


Simon is the second major recurring secondary 
antagonist
 in the 
TV Series
, with the first being 
Merle Dixon
, the third being 
Beta
, and the fourth being 
Leah Shaw
.

Simon is the first major recurring secondary antagonist to appear in more than two and a half seasons, making him the longest major recurring secondary antagonist on 
The Walking Dead
.


Additionally, he is the first main character to be a secondary antagonist for more than half a season.


Simon is the second major recurring secondary antagonist to be killed by a major recurring primary antagonist, the first being Merle Dixon.


Simon is the first major recurring secondary antagonist who is part of the main cast but is listed under "Also Starring", with the second being Leah Shaw.


In the casting call for the game 
Grand Theft Auto V
, 
Steven Ogg
's character was named Simon, later changed to Trevor in the final version.
[6]


Steven Ogg noted that he cited the film 
The Big Short
 as inspiration for Simon's backstory.


Simon appears to hold an interest in art, as expressed by his admiration of a masterpiece portrait of Charles V owned by 
Gregory
 which he accurately described as 'management by example",
[7]
 he also appeared slightly impressed with 
Anne
's metal artwork in the 
Heaps
.


Simon is said to enjoy alcoholic beverages, most notably tequila and supposedly gin; however he later compares it to turpentine, he also dislikes scotch as he personally describes it as "ashtrays and window cleaner".
[7]


Simon has killed the third largest amount of living people in the TV Universe, having a total of at least 172 victims (including himself). 
Negan
 has the second largest with a total of 230 victims and Rick has the largest with a total of at least 3,070 victims.


Following his extermination of the Scavengers, it was confirmed by Negan in "
Worth
" that Simon is the Savior responsible for wiping out all of the male 
Oceanside
 residents aged 10 and above.

Furthermore, when talking to the 
Library Survivor
, it was implied that he also had the library community completely wiped out; something that was later confirmed in the 
same episode
 when 
Carol
 and 
Morgan
 came across and stayed in the library.


Simon is one of nine series regulars to die while being credited under "Also Starring", the others being 
Gareth
, 
Bob Stookey
, 
Deanna Monroe
, 
Jessie Anderson
, 
Spencer Monroe
,

Sanctuary
's fence, the others being a 
red-haired Savior
 and 
Gordon
.


Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Steven Ogg filmed the big fight scene between Negan and Simon in "
Worth
" themselves rather than using stunt performers. This is despite neither of them having any formal fight training.
[8]


Steven Ogg joked on 
Talking Dead
 that the zombified Simon may be one of the few "smart 
walkers
" left as he knows where he is and what he wants to do which is that he's at the Sanctuary and kill anything in its path, though more specifically kill Negan.


Zombie Simon makes high-pitched hissing, presumably due to his larynx being crushed by Negan.


Simon is one of thirteen main characters to become a walker, the others being 
Shane Walsh
, 
Merle Dixon
, 
Hershel Greene
, 
Deanna Monroe
, 
Spencer Monroe
, 
Sasha Williams
, 
Enid
, 
Tara Chambler
, 
Siddiq
, "
Alpha
", 
Alden
, and 
Lance Hornsby
.


Simon is the only character to indirectly cause the deaths of other survivors long after his own death. In this case, he caused the death of eight Saviors who took part in the Oceanside massacre with him nearly 18 months after his death by Negan's hands.


Simon is one of fifteen main characters to be killed by another main character, the others being 
Dale Horvath
, 
Shane Walsh
, 
Merle Dixon
, 
Hershel Greene
, 
Gareth
, 
Abraham Ford
, 
Glenn Rhee
, 
Spencer Monroe
, 
Gregory
, 
Enid
, 
Tara Chambler
, "
Alpha
", 
Leah Shaw
, and 
Lance Hornsby
.

Dwight
 in the 
TV Series
.


Simon appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Variant
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Simon appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".


Simon is one of the four 
TV Universe
 characters to appear in 
Dead City
, the others being
