Overview
[
]


Hershel is an intelligent and mature boy despite his age. Unlike the other kids, 
Judith
, 
Gracie
, and 
R.J.
, who have lived inside the walls of their communities, Hershel has spent a lot of his time on the road. Because of this, he appears to be a lot more experienced and accustomed to the harsh outside world. This is shown when the other kids are reluctant to eat horsemeat, while Hershel is completely fine with it and also mentions how he has eaten spiders before. He still retains some childlike innocence and gets along with the other kids and is shown to love his 
mother
 very much. 

Though he never met his 
father
, he is greatly saddened by his death. When he correctly deduces that 
Negan
 is the man who killed him, he holds him at gunpoint but lowers it after some convincing. After this, Hershel greatly resents Negan. When Negan helps Hershel out of the underground hole, Hershel shoves Negan away in anger.

Now a teenager in 
Dead City
, Hershel appears to have become surly and rebellious, blowing off his weapons' training and purposefully doing the opposite of what his mother tells him to do and backtalking her. However, Hershel is also courageous, taking up a 
shovel
 and a brick to fight off 
the Burazi
 despite it being useless and defiantly refusing to give 
the Croat
 any information on 
Negan
. He has also developed an interest in the guitar and drawing, but has abandoned his previous love of wearing hats, rejecting one that his mother offers to him as a gift after Hershel's rescue.

It's later revealed that Hershel has grown angry and resentful towards his mother for her obsession with Negan, feeling that Maggie doesn't see him and is only constantly looking over his shoulder for Negan. Tired of the life that he's living, Hershel admits that he had felt safer in Manhattan than at 
the Bricks
 where he's just waiting for the next threat to come around and he believes that Maggie only came after him for her 
revenge
 upon Negan rather than to save her son. Hershel's harsh words cause Maggie to explain her reasons and to promise him that she will find a way to put everything with Negan behind her once and for all so that she can finally find peace, something that pleases Hershel. During his time in Manhattan, 
the Dama
 gained Hershel's trust and he told her about his 
father
's 
murder
 and Negan's role in it, although the Dama later 
cut off
 Hershel's right pinky toe.

Negan continues to carry a great deal of affection for Hershel, risking his life to help Maggie on a rescue mission for the boy despite Hershel's hatred of him. During their brief reunion, Negan warmly greets Hershel who is mainly angry about his mother's continuing obsession with Negan and doesn't respond. The Dama, after having heard the story of Glenn's murder from Hershel, later notes that she could sense that Negan feels remorseful and responsible for the boy whose family he had destroyed, something that Hershel himself couldn't sense. As a result, the Dama is able to threaten Negan into compliance by using Hershel as leverage against him, even after Hershel has been released.

"
A New Beginning
"


Hershel was born in the fall of 2012, several months after the end of the war against the 
Saviors
. Maggie had named her son after his late grandfather, 
Hershel
 and kept his father's surname, 
Rhee
.  

In early 2014, while everyone is at 
Kenneth
's funeral, a saddened Maggie holds Hershel and watches from the balcony. Later that night, she takes him out for a stroll and runs into 
Gregory
, who tells her someone may have defaced Glenn's grave. When Maggie is attacked by a 
hooded stranger
, Hershel falls from his stroller to the grass and starts crying, before being picked up. The next day, Rick arrives at the Hilltop to visit. On the balcony, he holds Hershel and calls him perfect, kissing him on his head. Maggie jokingly calls him a "stinker" and then carries him to his crib to sleep.

"
Stradivarius
"


At some point, during the six years after Rick's supposed death, Maggie, along with Hershel, left Hilltop for 
Georgie's group
. Maggie didn't want to be near 
Negan
, which was a constant reminder of Glenn's murder, and didn't want Hershel to grow up in that same mindset. 



Georgie's Group


Hershel grew up being raised in different communities as his mom, 
Georgie
, 
Hilda
, and 
Midge
 assisted the settlements by offering knowledge of infrastructure. However, all the settlements eventually fell. While in a community in 
Tennessee
, Georgie and the twins left out west. Afterwards, the community in Tennessee fell. 

At some point, while they were on their own, Maggie and Hershel encountered an old man who pretended that he needed their help in order to rob the two. Maggie played along, but in reality she reversed the ambush and killed the man and his accomplices. After dealing with the old man's horrifically mutilated victims, Maggie found plenty of food for herself and Hershel.

Maggie then remembered how she and Glenn talked about going to her grandmother's beach house after 
Beth
 had died, and so she returned to 
Georgia
 and brought Hershel to her grandmother's. With no 
walkers
 around, Hershel was able to play on the beach and Maggie was able to relax. There, she spent all night talking to Hershel about his mom's side of the family. He then asked Maggie how his father died. She answered that a bad man killed him, to which Hershel wanted to know if the bad man was dead. Maggie couldn't answer him.



The Wardens


The next day, Maggie and Hershel met another community that needed her help. It also fell, as it was attacked by the 
Reapers
 - leaving only Hershel, Maggie, 
Cole
, 
Elijah
, 
Maya
, 
Ainsley
, 
Gus
, 
Kim
, 
Matty
, 
Billy
, and 
Jen
. In the summer of 2021, Maggie receives a letter from 
Carol
, stating that 
Jesus
, 
Enid
, and 
Tara
 were killed by a group called the 
Whisperers
 - a cult of primitivists who wear the faces of walkers to camouflage walkers and control herds. With thousands of walkers at their disposal, they threaten the communities - and Carol pleads for Maggie to return and to help. Maggie agrees to help and brings Hershel and their friends.

Home Sweet Home

While Maggie, Elijah, and Cole went to deal with the Whisperers and help the communities, Hershel stayed behind in a cabin in the woods with Maya, Ainsley, Gus, Kim, Matty, Billy, and Jen. However, a 
Reaper
 following through on 
Pope
's hit out on Maggie, attacks the cabin by setting it on fire. Jen and Billy die in the blaze while Hershel escapes with the others. 

The Reaper then began to shoot at the survivors, killing Matty and causing the others to split up. Kim picked up Hershel to get away faster. After being separated from Kim, Hershel climbs a tree. Maggie, along with 
Daryl
, 
Kelly
, Elijah, and Cole reunite with Gus, Maya, and Ainsley. However, Gus is killed by the Reaper. Maya then goes looking for Hershel and finds him in the tree. However, Maya and Ainsley get shot and killed by the Reaper. Before dying, Maya showed Maggie Hershel's direction. 

Maggie and Daryl are then attacked by the Reaper, but is then shot by Kelly and surrounded by Elijah and Cole. The Reaper reveals to Maggie that Pope marked her, before killing himself with a grenade. Hershel, still in the tree, heard his mom whistle for him and whistled back. Seeing his mom first, he threw an acorn at her head and greeted her. Afterwards, Hershel and Maggie went to the trailers to sleep, and the next day returned to Alexandria. Hershel then passes Negan, the man who murdered his father.

Hershel somberly notes that the adults say the same thing before the apocalypse, but can't promise to come back safely nowadays. Judith says it's just to make the children feel better, but Hershel believes it's to make themselves feel better. However, his mood perks up when he wins a round of cards. 

Later that day, Hershel can be seen playing a game of rock-paper-scissors with R.J. while he waits for Judith to bring in the horsemeat to eat. The children are reluctant to eat it, but Hershel assures them it isn't that bad, or better than spiders at least.

The Rotten Core

Negan
 sees that Hershel has been captured by

 and realizes that the young boy had stowed away in 
Maggie
's truck. As Daniels takes Hershel to a room and reports in, Negan sneaks up behind him and kills Daniels with his 
crowbar
 before an astonished Hershel.

Negan takes Hershel to the hidden apartment where everyone else is hiding and radios Maggie about Hershel stowing away. Despite Maggie's concern for her son, Negan promises Maggie that Hershel is safe with him and that something will have to happen to Negan before he allows Hershel to be harmed. Maggie is concerned about leaving Hershel in the hands of the man who killed 
his father
, but 
Annie
, aware of what Negan had done, reassures Maggie that Negan is someone who will do whatever he can to protect her son.

Alone with Negan, Hershel tells Negan that his mother had told him to stay away from Negan and asks why Maggie doesn't like him. Negan states that it was because of something bad that had happened a long time ago and he was a bad man. Hershel pulls a gun on Negan, having realized that Negan is the bad man who had killed his dad. Sitting down, Negan admits that Hershel is right and that there's nothing that he can say or do to make up for Glenn's 
murder
. While Negan doesn't blame Hershel for wanting 
revenge
, if he shoots Negan, the gunshot will draw the 
Commonwealth soldiers
 to them and while Negan might deserve to die for his actions, the other people with them don't. After looking at the people gathered outside of the room, Hershel silently lowers the gun which is taken from him by 
Lydia
. Hershel then runs out as Negan cries.

After the battle, Negan notices Hershel silently glaring at him. Recognizing that they have unfinished business, Negan tells the young boy to return to 
the Hilltop
 and help his mother rebuild. If Hershel still wants revenge in a few years, he can look Negan up then and they'll settle matters between them at that time. After Negan walks away, Maggie asks Hershel what Negan had said to him, but Hershel remains silent.



"
Trust
"


Hershel visits 
his father
's grave at 
the Hilltop
. As he leaves and passes the cellar, 
Lance
 emerges and introduces himself to Hershel. Lance questions if Hershel or his mom has taken any exciting trips lately, but he just silently shakes his head. Claiming that he only wants the truth and he can fix things if he has it, Lance tries to convince Hershel to help him, stating that he can't keep people safe if they keep secrets. However, Hershel refuses to tell Lance anything, stating that he should probably go get Maggie.

As Hershel begins to walk away, Lance stops him, calling Hershel a good and brave kid. Pulling out Hershel's hat, which Hershel had accidentally left behind at 
Riverbend
, Lance puts it back on the boy's head, having correctly deduced that Hershel was present and discovers the hat to be a perfect fit. Before Lance can harass Hershel any further, 
Elijah
 slams him against the wall, creating a standoff as Maggie, Daryl and the 
Commonwealth soldiers
 rush to the scene. Running to Maggie's side, Hershel tells her that Lance had said that something bad was going to happen. Backed up by Daryl, Maggie warns Lance against messing with her family at gunpoint and orders Lance and his soldiers to leave which he reluctantly complies with.

Season 1

"
Old Acquaintances
"


A few weeks after Hershel's kidnapping, 
Maggie
 seeks out the help of 
Negan
 to rescue him, having recognized 
the Croat
 as a former 
Savior
. The two eventually reach a deal, and Negan accompanies Maggie to 
Manhattan
 to rescue her son.

Hershel briefly appears in Maggie's nightmare of 
Glenn
's 
murder
, calling out to his mother for help.

Tied to a chair, Hershel is visited by the Croat who compliments the boy on acting tough like his mother and maybe his father. The Croat questions if Hershel ever met the man who killed his father, telling the boy that Glenn's killer Negan had lived among Maggie's 
people
 for years. The Croat asks what Hershel knows about Negan, but Hershel defiantly tells his captor that 
"you can sit there in the dark trying to freak me out, but I'm not saying shit,"
 amusing the Croat. Going through some nearby drawers, the Croat tells Hershel that he was fascinated by Manhattan as a boy, especially how there was so many people on such a tiny island, noting that ironically the city is much more alive in death than it ever was before the outbreak 
"because the struggle galvanizes you. Shows you the strength you had inside you all along. You know, I think you're gonna like it here."
 The Croat menacingly rest a blade on Hershel's leg, apparently about to torture him, before being interrupted by one of his men with the news that someone has gotten away.



"
Who's There?
"


In a flashback, 
Maggie
 enters Hershel's room and admonishes him for missing weapons' training again where 
Lane
 brought out the bo 
staffs
. This is the third time this month that Hershel has skipped training, and Maggie tries to emphasize how important it is to be ready at all times. More interested in drawing, Hershel dismissively tells his mother that he's got it, but Maggie warns her son that it's not a joke and that people could come at you with anything. 
"Then I guess I'd be dead,"
 Hershel morbidly quips. Maggie compliments one of Hershel's drawings, but he crumples it up, tells Maggie that it sucks and leaves to go to 
Xander
's, much to Maggie's dismay who picks up Hershel's drawing.



"
Everybody Wins a Prize
"


While fighting walkers at 
Madison Square Garden
, 
Maggie
 has a flashback of Hershel calling out to her.



"
Stories We Tell Ourselves
"


In a flashback, 
Maggie
 runs after her son as he's abducted by 
the Burazi
, but she's restrained by other Burazi. 
The Croat
 hands 
Negan
's Wanted poster to Maggie: he wants Negan in return for Hershel.



"
Doma Smo
"


The group arrives at the 
Security One Bank
 where the Croat has been keeping Hershel locked up in the vault. Negan asks Maggie to look after Ginny for him as the Burazi bring Hershel out who is shocked to see his mother holding a knife to Negan's throat. Maggie and the Croat trade Negan for Hershel with Negan telling the boy that it's good to see him as Negan walks by. Maggie embraces her son for the first time since he was kidnapped, but Hershel barely responds to her.

In Maggie's truck, Hershel brushes off his mother's attempts to talk about his ordeal, stating that all he ever does back home is to wait for the next bad thing to happen and, if anything, Hershel felt safer in Manhattan. The two fight about Hershel's refusal to eat, and Hershel finds the hat that Negan had gotten for him. Maggie tells him that it was a gift and it's like the one that he used to wear, but Hershel just thanks her sarcastically for getting him a souvenir for being kidnapped. Maggie tells Hershel that she's glad to have him back, but Maggie's son accuses her of caring more about revenge. Over Maggie's objections that she came for him and that it's not true, Hershel tells his mother that 
"it's like you're obsessed with him. With Negan. With what he did. Getting him back. You've always... And I'm right here. But you don't see me. It's like my whole life you've been looking over my shoulder, watching for him, waiting for him. But you never see me. Whatever. It doesn't matter."
 Maggie finally realizes that her obsession with and anger at Negan has consumed and controlled her to the point that it's badly affected her relationship with Hershel which is something that Maggie had 
once
 told Negan that she never wanted to end up happening: allowing her rage at Negan to continue to control her and for her son to see it. As Hershel turns his head away in order to hide his tears, Maggie looks across the water at the badly damaged 
Statue of Liberty
 before she drives off.

At the Bricks, Maggie puts Ginny's dinosaur toy on the bed next to the sleeping young girl. Maggie visits Hershel and tells him that 
"I've been um... thinking about what you said. You know, for a long time, for most of my life, I felt like the world kept taking... and kept taking, and, um, I think at some point, I thought that if I could just fight hard enough, I'd be able to get it back. A little piece of it at least. But it doesn't work that way, because you just end up losing what you got. And I don't wanna keep doing that anymore. I don't know how, but this thing with Negan... I'm gonna finish it. So that I can just let it go."
 Hershel is pleased with Maggie's confession.

The Dama
 offers him the keys to the kingdom, but wonders how she can be sure, pointing out that Negan might not be the man that he used to be and maybe he never was which Negan acknowledges. The Dama presents Negan with a small box containing a 
severed
 pinky toe. At the Bricks, Hershel, who is missing his right pinky toe, plays his guitar as the Dama explains to Negan that she had a lot of talks with Hershel who told the Dama the story of the man who had murdered his father, not just in front of his mother, but an unborn Hershel as well. The Dama could sense in the rest of Hershel's story what Hershel himself couldn't, that his father's killer might feel remorseful and responsible for the boy whose family he destroyed. Maggie goes through Hershel's drawings which include images of Manhattan, the vault that he was imprisoned in and the Dama. Hershel had only told the Dama this story once he felt safe with her, and here Negan is, having come all of this way to save him. The Dama eventually let Hershel go in exchange for Negan, but she kept a little piece of him 
"and I can always go back for more. Make it last. We have a lot to discuss. A lot to plan for."
 Negan finally takes the drink that the Dama had offered him, and Maggie and Negan get the same look on their face at the realization of the threat that the Dama poses to Hershel and the lengths that she's willing to go to.

"Just take really small bites. The smaller, the better. (…) Yeah, on the road, with my mom. You eat what you find. You ever been on the road? (…) Well, you meet a lot of different people. Just chew it fast. It's not that bad. 
Not like the spiders.
"
- Hershel to Judith, Gracie, and R.J., "
Hunted
"

"You can keep sitting there in the dark trying to freak me out, but I'm not saying 
shit
."
- Hershel to the Croat while being interrogated, "
Old Acquaintances
"





"It's like you're 
obsessed
 with him. With Negan. With what he did. Getting him back. You've always... (…) And I'm right here. But you don't see me. It's like my whole life you've been looking over my shoulder, watching for him, waiting for him. (…) But you 
never see me
. Whatever. It doesn't matter."
- Hershel to his mother after being rescued, "
Doma Smo
"

Trivia
[
]


Hershel is the fifth known child in the 
TV Series
 to be born into the apocalypse, the first being 
Judith Grimes
, the second and third being two unnamed infants living at the 
Kingdom
, the fourth being 
Gracie
, the sixth being 
R.J. Grimes
, the seventh being 
Ezra
, the eighth being 
Aliyah
, and the ninth being 
Mariam
.


Hershel is one of several characters to be portrayed by multiple actors. The others are 
Judith Grimes
, 
Michonne
, 
Mike
, 
Terry
, 
Hannah
, 
Paula
, 
Alice
, and 
Elijah
.


During the time jump, Hershel experienced many tragedies.

He had to evacuate several settlements, including a place near Knoxville and 
Meridian
.


Maggie mentions in "
Home Sweet Home
" that she was starving, and Hershel was almost. In "
Hunted
", Hershel tells Judith, Gracie and R.J. that he ate spiders while out on the road.


In "Home Sweet Home", it is confirmed that Maggie would tell Hershel stories about his 
grandfather
, aunt 
Beth
, uncle 
Shawn
 and his 
father
.

Hershel wasn't told the identity of the 
man
 that killed his father, only that he is a "Bad Man".

He figures it out when talking to Negan in "
The Rotten Core
".


Hershel is incorrectly credited as 
Hershell
 in the end credits for "
No Other Way
".


With 
Marco
's death, Hershel, 
Papa Bear
, and 
Douglas
 are the only named Hilltop residents confirmed to be alive.

Of the three, Hershel is the only one credited throughout his appearances.


Hershel appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Hershel is present in the scene in "
A New Deal
" where Pamela addresses the Commonwealth residents and blames Lance for the deaths of the many residents, however his entire body is obstructed by Mercer's body armor in the foreground due to the camera angles used, making it appear as if he is absent.


Hershel is one of twelve characters to survive the 
TV Series
 who also survive in the 
Comic Series
, the others being 
Maggie Rhee
, 
Michonne Grimes
, 
Eugene Porter
, 
Aaron
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Magna
, 
Yumiko Okumura
, 
Lydia
, 
Juanita Sanchez
, 
Michael Mercer
, and 
Pamela Milton
.


Unlike 
Judith
, 
R.J.
, 
Gracie
, 
Ezra
 and 
Socorro
, Hershel does not appear in the alternative ending scene
[2]
 in "
Rest in Peace
" that takes place in the future. It is unknown why he isn't present.

The events in 
Dead City
 may tie into why he wasn't involved: "
Three years after the 
conflict
 with the 
Commonwealth
, Hershel was kidnapped and brought to Manhattan by "
The Croat
" under unknown circumstances
[3]
"
.


Hershel is one of the four 
TV Universe
 characters to appear in 
Dead City
, the others being 
Maggie Rhee
, 
Negan Smith
, and 
Simon
.
