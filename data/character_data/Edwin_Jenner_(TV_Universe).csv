,,,"Despite only appearing in two episodes, Edwin was shown to be a highly intelligent, determined, and caring person who was dedicated to his career as a virologist and was also a loving husband to his beloved wife, Candace. In contrast to his colleagues who either fled the CDC during the start of the outbreak or took their lives, Jenner chose to stay behind and work for as long as he could, although it was later revealed that he only did this at his dying wife's request, not because he wanted to.
Despite being safely sheltered from the apocalyptic hell occurring outside the CDC, Jenner was extremely well aware of the utter horrors and cruelty of the new world and viewed it as being mankind's extinction event and that staying alive was pointless as a painful death was inevitable. Jenner believed so strongly in this that he attempted to trap Rick and his group in the failing, set-to-detonate CDC complex to offer them a peaceful death, although after hearing their protests to try for as long as they could, Jenner agreed to give them a chance. He appeared pleased that the group managed to escape before meeting his demise alongside 
Jacqui
.
As revealed in a video message, before his wife's death, Jenner was far more optimistic and excited about his research into stopping the 
Wildfire Virus
. Jenner goes so far as to tell his French colleagues in the video message that 
""the day will come when we beat this""
, something that his wife kept telling him. Jenner's more subdued, depressed and suicidal state appears to have been brought on by Candace's death.","Edwin worked alongside his wife, 
Candace Jenner
 and the computer-AI 
Vi
 at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. He knew a fair deal about the building and facility as well as safety protocols and decontamination steps.","During the onset of the outbreak, Jenner, alongside his wife, and their colleagues in the CDC attempted to find a cure to reverse the outbreak however the situation only worsened despite their efforts and many of his colleagues either fled the CDC to be with their families or committed suicide.
At some point, Candace was bitten and infected and decided to donate her body to be studied in the hopes of developing a cure. Before her death, Candace begged her husband to keep trying to find a cure for as long as he could and Jenner reluctantly agreed at his wife's request. Candace then died and Jenner put her down. He recorded her death and reanimation time, timing it exactly as two hours, one minute, seven seconds.
For the next 63 days, Jenner worked completely isolated in the fortified CDC trying to develop a cure, having only the CDC's main computer VI for interaction. During this time, he lost all contact with the outside world and was unaware if there were other research facilities still functioning however he learned that scientists in France were the last to hold out. He also armed and trained himself with discarded military weapons.","Killed By
Vi
 
(Caused)
With the CDC building losing power, Vi deploys the HITs to prevent any diseases from escaping and decontaminates the entire facility.
Himself 
(Suicide)
Edwin decides to commit suicide in the explosion, along with Jacqui, after losing hope in developing a cure.","This list shows the victims Edwin has killed:

The Day Will Come When You Won't Be

Despite being a scientist, Jenner does not rule out the possibility that the walker virus is of supernatural origin as seen when Jacqui suggests ""the wrath of God"" is a possible cause of the virus to which Jenner replies 
""there is that""
.
