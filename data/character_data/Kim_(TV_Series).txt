After the 
Reapers
 destroyed her home village, Kim and several of her fellow survivors fled far enough until the point they had successfully escaped the Reapers. She and the majority of the survivors were staying at a rendezvous while 
Maggie
, 
Cole
, and 
Elijah
 went out to ensure Hilltop was safe despite the recent Whisperer threat. At some point, the rendezvous was attacked and 
Billy
 and 
Jen
 were killed while the rest of the group fled, including Kim. According to 
Maya
, at some point while fleeing in the woods, the group was split up and Kim picked up 
Hershel
 to help get away from the 
unseen threat
 faster. When the attacker corners Maggie, Kim and another man are among the reinforcements to rush to save her. Following the attacker's demise, she arrives at the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where she's welcomed alongside the other Meridian refugees.

After returning home from the mission in 
Meridian
, Kim and the other

 comfort a wounded and traumatized Elijah as he settles in. After a brief commotion at the gates of Alexandria, Kim sits on the porch of the meeting house with the other Alexandrians and listens as

Commonwealth
, presents the survivors with a decision regarding the future of their home and livelihoods.
