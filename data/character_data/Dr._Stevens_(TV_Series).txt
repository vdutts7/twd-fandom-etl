Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Dr. Stevens' life prior to or as the outbreak began. It is possible that she lived in or near Woodbury. It is also likely she was a trained doctor.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Season 3
[
]


"
Walk With Me
"
[
]


Dr. Stevens assumes as the acting physician for the town of Woodbury, providing medical care to sick and injured citizens. She is seen caring for 
Andrea Harrison
, a newcomer to Woodbury, and later talks to 
Lieutenant Welles
 with 
the Governor
 about the helicopter crash and the location of the National Guard military convoy. When the Governor gives the word, she leaves him alone with the Lieutenant.



"
Made to Suffer
"
[
]


Dr. Stevens treated the Governor at the clinic after he was attacked and stabbed in the eye by 
Michonne Hawthorne
. She remains in the clinic and begins caring for the wounded from the arena and earlier raid.



"
The Suicide King
"
[
]


Dr. Stevens is at the infirmary caring for the wounded, including nine residents who were hurt in the previous night’s raid by Rick’s group. Andrea visits her to check on the wounded and to give Milton a report on the status of the patients.



"
I Ain't a Judas
"
[
]


After Milton brings in Tyreese, Sasha, Allen, and Ben to Woodbury, Dr. Stevens is summoned to the infirmary to perform a medical evaluation on the newcomers.



"
Welcome to the Tombs
"
[
]


Following the failed 
prison assault
, Dr. Stevens' fate is unclear. However, she is most likely dead as it is likely she was among the Woodbury soldiers killed during the prison raid or massacred by the Governor out on the road as she was not seen with the remaining Woodburians arriving at the prison.

Trivia
[
]


Dr. Stevens was credited for "
The Suicide King
" but the scene was deleted.


Her appearance in the Comic Series was that of a Caucasian male in his late 40s, while her TV counterpart is that of an African-American female in her early to mid 50s.

She is the first character whose ethnicity has been changed from Caucasian to African-American for the TV Series, the second being 
Bob Stookey
.


She is also the first character whose gender has been changed from male to female for the TV Series, the second being 
Deanna Monroe
, third being 
Reg Monroe
, fourth being 
Farron
, and the fifth being 
Kelly
.


As of January 2021, the actress has never watched the show, let alone her scenes. She also admitted that she thought her character would have had more than three episode appearances (two on-screen, one deleted) given her comic counterpart's status in the source material.
