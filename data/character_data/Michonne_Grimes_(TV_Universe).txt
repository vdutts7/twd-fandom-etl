If

 were here right now, what would he say? What would he want you to do with this new chance to be with those you love? Hm? Despite all the odds, all the years, I found you, Rick. I came here through the hell that we have both been through to take you home. You think that's all for nothing? For us to just go our separate ways? No. We go 
home
, Rick, and we figure out how to protect it together. That's how we make it all make sense. We love on each other, as hard as we can, while we can.

Overview
[
]


Michonne is both a tough and a good hearted survivor. She tends to work alone and keeps much of her past secret, even towards Andrea, but possesses a keen sense of intuition. Michonne once said that she "trusts her gut" when it comes to other survivors. After the loss of her boyfriend, she suffered from hallucinations in which she would talk to him. It was revealed that she likes art and/or sculptures as she looted a cat sculpture and claimed that it was "too damn gorgeous" to leave behind. When she first comes to the group she is very quiet. As time goes on, however, she gradually opens up to the group, specifically Rick and Carl, and becomes accepted by the whole group.

Michonne appeared to have an aversion to babies, as she vehemently refused to hold Rick's daughter 
Judith
 until 
Beth Greene
 forced her to, and, while looking at Judith, shed tears, before hugging Judith close. Michonne later establishes that this is a manifestation of the guilt she feels for losing her own son, 
Andre
.

Toward the end of the 
fifth season
 when the group is presented the offer to join 
Alexandria
, unlike most of the group, Michonne is confident of 
Aaron
's good faith, showing an optimistic attitude contrasting with Rick's irrational distrust. Michonne assures Rick that they can't let that opportunity go if they want to stay sane, and encourages everyone to try and integrate in their new lifestyle, arguing that spending so much time without a sense of safety had nearly stripped the group out of their humanity. As part of this, she decides to "live again" and in response, hangs up her sword on the wall. 

When she next goes outside the walls again, for the first time in days, she starts to feel uncomfortable and is internally struggling with the want or need to be on the outside, and at the same time, finds solace the the fact that she did not reach for her sword. When she later sees Rick having his tantrum after beating up 
Pete
, she quickly steps in and knocks him out to avoid the risk of the group being kicked out. Later, Michonne reluctantly agrees with Rick in the fact that 
Deanna
's leadership approach puts the community at risk. After Pete finds her sword and tries to kill Rick with it, ending in 
Reg
's death, Deanna allows Rick to execute Pete, tacitly admitting that killing is necessary in some cases. Due to this, Michonne debates putting the sword back on the wall. She decides to put it on her back again, indicating she's reached a balance between wanting to try and never wanting to forget. 

Eventually, Rick decides to confront the tyrannical rule of 
Negan
 and 
The Saviors
, resulting in Alexandria's subjugation, 
Glenn
 and 
Abraham
's deaths, and Rick's complete loss of confidence and hope. Upon his decision of obeying Negan's abusive rules, Michonne tries to make Rick understand that that kind of life is no life at all, and that they should fight the tyranny to give everyone a better future, showing her optimistic outlook once again. Rick undestands Michonne's vision once Aaron is nearly beaten to death due to a simple misunderstanding with a Savior, making him admit that his judgement was clouded by the guilt, and starting to plan their insurrection against Negan.  

By 
Season 9
, and 18 months after the end of the war against the Saviors, Michonne has adopted a more peaceful and democratic way of leadership and is seen trying to unite all the communities to accomplish Carl's vision of rebuilding a civilization for the future.

Six years later after Rick's supposed "death", Michonne has started to be hardened, colder, distrustful and cautious to newcomers, and is distant from other communities, mostly Hilltop. She is extremely suspicious of outsiders such as 
Magna's group
, refusing to let them settle in Alexandria but relenting to take them to the Hilltop at the insistence of Judith. Michonne's attitude towards Magna's group softens overtime and she later tells Daryl that while she started helping them because Judith vouched for the group, Michonne is now willing to vouch for their trustworthiness herself. Due to the events of 
Jocelyn
 and her kids, Michonne has become distant from her oldest friends who treat her coldly to the point that Michonne feared what Maggie would do to her if they met again. She also refuses to mend bridges with the other communities in the way that people would like. However, the threat of 
the Whisperers
 has helped Michonne begin to reconcile at least somewhat with her friends, expressing her appreciation for Daryl's search for Rick's body and earning her the warm thanks of Tara for Michonne's help with the situation that had erupted. While initially angry at 
Aaron
 for his stance of keeping up communication with the other communities, Michonne later apologizes to him for her reaction. 



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


Michonne grew up in Georgia, although not much is known about her early life. She originated from a middle-class academic realm family, where she grew up with a keen interest in both modern art and literature.

In college, Michonne studied creative writing, computer science, art history and then creative writing again before dropping out.
[3]
 During this time, she befriended 
Jocelyn
. They would help each other with whatever struggles they had in their personal lives, primarily that of their dating lives, the death of Michonne's mother, and when Michonne was trying to get signatures for a petition.
[4]


At some point later in her life, Michonne entered into a relationship with her boyfriend 
Mike
. They went on to have a son named 
Andre
. The three lived together as an upper middle class family and enjoyed a privileged and lavish lifestyle.
[5]
 Michonne also befriended Mike's closest friend 
Terry
, whereupon the three came to share a valued interest in art.
[5]




Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At the onset of the outbreak, Michonne found a katana upon which she honed her survival skills to perfection as a result of encountering and killing walkers day-by-day.
[6]
 Sometime later Michonne, Mike, Terry, and Andre journeyed to a refugee camp where they settled. Over time, several members abandoned the camp due to events worsening. Michonne chose to remain there despite this, which often resulted in several arguments between the three. Mike then began to express a resignation to live.
[5]


After arriving back from a supply run, Michonne tragically discovered the camp had been overrun. At the time, Mike and Terry had been high on drugs and were unable to fight, which resulted in Andre being devoured by walkers and the two becoming bitten. Experiencing bitterness and hatred, Michonne coldly allowed them to turn, amputated their arms and lower jaws and chained them up. 

For the next months, Michonne traveled with them closely behind her at all times to avoid being seen by walkers, as their undead status provided camouflage.
[7]
 Morally broken from her losses, Michonne spent her time aimlessly surviving alone, keeping low and avoiding all contact with other survivors who she encountered.

Following their encounter, Michonne and Andrea began to travel together, protecting each other from the dangers they encountered, and formed a strong friendship over the winter.



"
Seed
"


When Andrea fell sick, Michonne had to take care of her and then they took refuge in a deer cooler. She heads to a local pharmacy searching for medical supplies when she runs into a group of walkers, all of which she decapitates with her katana. She takes aspirins and heads back to the shelter. 

Upon arriving, Michonne finds Andrea lying on the floor of their refuge. She gives her the pills and tells her that they should continue moving before a nearby horde reaches them, but Andrea refuses to leave claiming to be a burden. Michonne ignores her requests and the two leave together to continue traveling. 



"
Walk With Me
"


Michonne and Andrea continued their journey when they witnessed as a helicopter crashes in the woods. Upon arriving at the crash site, Michonne chains her walkers to a tree and tells Andrea to stay hidden in the bushes while she goes to investigate the helicopter. She discovers the bodies of the soldiers who were inside.

When a group of armed men arrive, Michonne and Andrea hide in the bushes to watch them. They see as the 
leader
 stabs one of the soldiers in the head, even though he already appeared dead. Michonne's walkers begin to make too much noise, and Michonne decapitates them to prevent their location from being compromised. However, they are both surprised from behind by 
Merle Dixon
, who orders them to drop their weapons as Andrea then faints.

They are taken by vehicle to 
Woodbury
, where they are kept locked in a room and placed under guard. After Andrea is taken care of, Merle comes to the room. Andrea fills him in on what has happened since Atlanta, while Michonne is visibly suspicious. When the Governor arrives, Michonne demands their weapons back, but he insists that they stay for the night. They are also informed that everyone is infected. The Governor then shows the two women around Woodbury, which is protected by a sturdy fence built around the town. 

The next day, they are given a tour around the town but Michonne is not impressed. When Milton indulges about her walker pets during lunch, she refuses to give out information about herself, leaving Andrea to do most of the talking. Michonne then demands to have her sword back, but the Governor tells her she is safe. Later that day, she argues with Andrea about her hostility which causes a small rift in their friendship. When the Governor and his soldiers return from a troop, Michonne listens in suspicion as he tells the residents that they have brought trucks and supplies from an army group they found dead on the road because they didn't have a safe place like Woodbury. 



"
Killer Within
"


Michonne investigates the army vehicles not believing the Governor's story. After finding blood trails and bullet holes in the vehicles, she is confronted by the Governor. He asks her to join his ranks, which she declines. Later that day, Michonne makes plans to leave with Andrea towards the coast, where she believes they will be safe. However, Andrea returns after talking with the Governor, and asks an angry Michonne to stay a few more days.



"
Say the Word
"


When the Governor plans a party for Woodbury, Michonne sneaks into his house to retrieve her sword. She comes across his notebook and discovers that he has written a series of names on the paper, underlining the name "Penny." Michonne flips through several pages of the book, realizing that he has made a series of marks page after page. She hears a noise coming from the closet, but before she can open the door, footsteps are heard outside the door.

Michonne hides behind a wall and watches as the Governor, Merle, and 
Milton
 enter. While they talk about the party, she sneaks out of the window and heads to an apparently deserted area filled with sand and a cage behind the building. Hearing growling from the cages, she discovers a handful of walkers inside. Smirking to herself, Michonne breaks open the lock to the cage door and lets them out while drawing her katana. She skillfully puts down all of the walkers, and just as she finishes, Tim arrives with a bucket of meat to feed them.

Michonne is then taken to the Governor's office where he scolds her for trespassing into the area and claims he has nothing to hide. 
"People with nothing to hide don't usually feel the need to say so,"
 Michonne replies. He lets her know he is not happy that she has been snooping around, and that other people want her out of Woodbury. Instead of kicking her out, he makes her an offer to join the research team. Michonne jumps up and takes him by surprise, snatching back her katana and holding it against his throat. She backs away and then storms out, sparing his life. 

When Andrea returns from her talk with the Governor, Michonne begins packing supplies to leave and warns that Woodbury is not what it seems. They make their way to the gate, where they plan to sneak out during the daytime. Merle stops them and says they will need an escort to leave. Andrea is swayed and wishes to stay. Despite feeling betrayed by her friend's decision, Michonne doesn't change her mind and leaves the town.



"
Hounded
"


Michonne is hunted by Merle, 
Crowley
, 
Tim
, and 
Gargulio
, on the Governor's orders due to posing a threat to his leadership. She manages to kill Crowley and Tim, but is shot in the thigh by Merle when she flees. When Michonne attempts to ambush them again, Merle knocks her sword away but is attacked by a group of walkers, giving her time to retrieve her katana and flee. While walking through the woods, she comes upon a few walkers, but discovers that the guts from a walker that were spilled on her earlier, camouflages her smell and causes the walkers to ignore her. 

When she arrives at an abandoned store, Michonne remains hidden and watches as 
Glenn
 and 
Maggie
 scavenge for supplies, and then as they are abducted by Merle. She takes the supplies the couple had scavenged and somehow finds her way to the 
prison
. Upon arriving outside the fences, 
Rick Grimes
 approaches her from inside and looks confused at her mysterious presence, while noticing that she is carrying the supplies and is surrounded by several walkers who do not attack her due to being covered in guts.



"
When the Dead Come Knocking
"


Michonne starts fighting off the walkers after the guts smell wears off but ends up passing out from her wound. Before the walkers can pounce on her, Rick and 
Carl
 shoot them and take her inside the prison, saving her life. Despite acting suspicious towards the group, Michonne opens up and tells them where she came from and how she knew Glenn and Maggie. She is then treated by 
Hershel Greene
 and watches as everyone embraces 
Carol
.

Later that day, Michonne accompanies Rick, 
Daryl
, and 
Oscar
 to Woodbury to attack and free the prisoners. On the way there, they end up in a cabin, where they encounter a dead dog and a 
hermit
. He seems to not be aware of the apocalypse and warns that he will call the cops. When he attempts to run and open the door to the waiting walkers, Michonne stabs him with her katana in the back. The group decides on throwing the man's corpse to the walkers as a distraction and run out of the back door. They arrive at Woodbury that night and start to plan their attack.



"
Made to Suffer
"


Michonne reveals a passageway that the group uses to invade Woodbury. After they successfully rescue Glenn and Maggie, she leaves the group and sneaks into the Governor's home, waiting for him to arrive and enact her revenge. While waiting, Michonne hears noises coming from a room. She walks inside and discovers to her horror the collection of heads as well as a zombified Penny. 

When Michonne attempts to put the zombified Penny down, the Governor arrives. He puts his weapons aside and begs her not to hurt his daughter. She coldly reminds him that Penny is already dead and stabs her through the head, causing a fight to break down between them. When the Governor gains the upper hand, Michonne pulls a shard of glass from a broken aquarium and stabs him through his right eye. She then attempts to kill him with her katana, but Andrea arrives and she is forced to leave a gunpoint. 

Michonne later rejoins the remaining group outside of Woodbury, but is held at gunpoint by Rick who demands to know where she went and what are her true motives for helping. She reminds the group that they will need her help to rescue Daryl and return back safely to the prison. Rick relents and accepts her apologies.



"
The Suicide King
"


When Rick and Maggie return from Woodbury after rescuing Daryl and bringing Merle along, Michonne attempts to attack Merle but is stopped by Rick. The group discusses the matter and decides not to allow Michonne to stay, as she is a loose cannon. Rick informs her that she has to leave after she all of her wounds are healed. Upon returning to the prison, Hershel patches her up and mentions she should rest for a few more days to heal from her contusions.



"
Home
"


Michonne spends time alone near the overturned bus on the yard when she witnesses as Rick runs outside by himself and appears to hallucinate. Later that day, she is present in the common room when Glenn invites her to help him with his plan to organize a sneak attack on Woodbury and execute the Governor to which she accepts. 

Before they can move forward with their plan, the Woodbury soldiers attack the prison and she is forced to counterattack from behind the bus. When a herd of walkers is unleashed on the field using a van, Michonne and Glenn successfully rescue Hershel from the approaching walkers and enter the main courtyard in time.



"
I Ain't a Judas
"


Following the Governor's attack, Michonne and the group remains inside C block where they discuss how to move forward. Later that day, she is doing some physical exercises when Merle arrives to speak to her. He apologizes for trying to kill her and tries to make amends, but she glares silently back at him. 

When Andrea arrives at the prison to talk with her former group, she accuses Michonne of turning them against her. Michonne counters that Andrea is living under the Governor's spell and reveals that he sent Merle to kill her. She then confesses she went back to Woodbury to unmask the Governor because she wanted to hurt Andrea's feelings for choosing him over her. That night, Michonne watches from her cell in silent as Beth sings.



"
Clear
"


Hoping to find more weapons for the prison's safety, Michonne goes on a run along with Rick and Carl. When they reach 
King County
 and stumble upon an armed man, a shootout ensues until Carl manages to shoot him. When Rick recognizes the man as 
Morgan Jones
, they drag him back to the building where he has stockpiled a lot of weapons. Despite Michonne's skepticism, Rick decides to wait until Morgan wakes up to talk with him.

Michonne then accompanies Carl look for a baby crib for Judith, and a picture of Lori, because he wants his sister to know what her mother looked like. She manages to retrieve the picture from a bar full of walkers, gaining Carl's trust. Before they leave town, Michonne tells Rick that she knows that he hallucinates with dead people, revealing that she used to talk to her dead boyfriend. They appear to gain a newfound respect for each other and leave.



"
Arrow on the Doorpost
";


Having earned her place in the group, Michonne remains in the prison while Rick, Daryl, and Hershel head to a meeting with the Governor to come to a peace agreement. When Glenn and Merle start to fight while waiting, Michonne attempts to intervene until Beth stops the fight. Later that day, Merle attempts to talk Michonne into accompanying him on his assassination mission, but she declines due to it being a risk to Rick's mission.



"
Prey

"
This Sorrowful Life
"


Michonne conceives a plan to lay spike strips at the prison for when the Governor arrives. When Merle takes her to the tombs under the pretense of clearing out walkers, he then knocks her unconscious, drags her to the boiler room and binds her wrists. After leaving the prison, Michonne is walked down down an abandoned road by Merle as he explains the Governor's deal to Rick. She notes that Merle has a conscience, but he disagrees. Upon arriving at an 
abandoned motel
, Merle tethers her to a post while he hotwires a car. He accidentally triggers the alarm, attracting walkers. Michonne is forced to fight off walkers while her hands are bound. They then hop in the car and drive off. 

Later that day, Michonne tells Merle that the group would have eventually welcomed him, but he chose to be an outsider. When he calls her an outsider too, she claims that at least after the Governor kills her she won't have to live with herself. Michonne then tries to convince Merle that they can return to the prison for a new chance, but he stops the car and sets her free, giving her sword back before he drives off alone. While walking back to the prison, Michonne runs into Daryl and sadly informs him what Merle was planning to do.

30 Days Without An Accident

Michonne rides into the prison on 
Flame
, returning from a scouting trip. Rick tells her, "We're glad to see you", to which she replies, "Glad to see you, too." She gives a stack of comics to Carl, asking that he let her read them after he's done. She also gives a razor to Rick, joking "Your face is losing the war." Michonne tells Rick and Daryl that she "didn't find him," referring to Philip. Michonne says that she considered going to Macon, but Daryl says she would have to go through "seventy miles of walkers." Michonne believes it would be worth it. When Daryl brings up the supply run with the others, Michonne volunteers to go with him, although Carl objects that she just got back. "And I'll be back," she promises.

When Sasha's group makes a supply run to 
Big Spot
, Daryl reveals he set up a boom box to draw walkers away from the area. Michonne is later listening to 
Zach
 and Daryl talk, and Zach tells her he has been trying to guess what Daryl did for a living before the turn. When Zach guesses a homicide cop, Michonne laughs and says that it makes sense. Before the group goes inside, Michonne asks Daryl, "We gonna do this Detective?"

Inside the store, Michonne is shopping with a cart when she runs into a Frankenstein cardboard cut-out that looks like a walker. She cuts it apart with her katana.

After 
Bob Stookey
 knocks down a shelf, walkers begin dropping in from the roof and Michonne helps the others fight them. However Zach is bitten and a broken helicopter falls through the roof. The group barely escapes in time.

Michonne is later seen in her cell at the prison that night, looking at a map. She traces a route to Macon with her finger.

Infected

Michonne sets out again for another run, and asks Carl and Rick if they want anything for her to grab. After Michonne leaves, she hears gunshots being fired from the prison, and rushes back. She enters through the gate that Carl opens for her but is caught by two walkers. Carl shoots one of the walkers down while Michonne injures her foot trying to get the other walker off her. She is carried back to the prison by Maggie and Carl and is treated for her foot injury by Beth.

While talking with Beth, Michonne tells Beth that she thinks Maggie and Carl's decision to save her and risk their lives was stupid. Beth lets Michonne know that people risk their lives for others because they care for them. Michonne is irritated by Judith's crying, so Beth takes her out to sing her a song. Michonne is doing exercises trying to strengthen her foot when Judith suddenly throws up on Beth. Beth asks Michonne to hold Judith while she cleans herself up, and she reluctantly agrees. Michonne stares into Judith's eyes and begins to weep, as she holds the baby close.

Isolation

Michonne attends the council meeting held in the library to determine what needs to be done about the sick people. Daryl plans a supply run to get medicine and Michonne volunteers. Hershel says that Michonne being in the car with Daryl may make her sick, to which she jokes, "He's already given me fleas."

Back outside, she and Daryl are looking at Zach's car. Daryl says he is glad Michonne is there. She asks "Where else would I be?" to which he responds, "Running off." Michonne says "You know I'm not running off." They are talking about her trips to search for the Governor.

Later, Daryl is driving Zach's car with Michonne, Bob, and Tyreese riding with him on the supply run. Daryl reminds Michonne that he knows she doesn't run off, but he insists the Governor's trail has gone cold and he would help Michonne look for him if it were any other way. Michonne does not reply. A voice comes on the radio saying "Those who arrive survive." Daryl is distracted by the radio and runs into walkers. The group realizes there are thousands of walkers coming towards them, and Daryl tries to back out. The car gets stuck and Michonne and the others fight their way out of the vehicle. They are pursued by walkers in the woods.



"
Indifference
"


With no car, the group is forced to walk in the woods and seems to have left the giant herd behind. Daryl finds a piece of jasper in the grass and berates Michonne for not being around, and Michonne jokes that the color looks good on him.

The group later discovers a car parked at an auto shop, but it is covered by vines and tree bushes. As they cut through the bushes, Tyreese relentlessly hacks away, knocking the handle off a door. Walkers begin coming through the bushes and Tyreese gets tackled by one because he wouldn't let it go.

Later Michonne and Tyreese are hacking at the bushes together, and Michonne tells him that he has every right to be angry, but his anger would make him stupid and get him killed. Tyreese asks her if she is still angry about the Governor. Michonne says that she would cut him in half if he was standing there, but not because she's angry, but because it needs to be done. Tyreese asks her why she is still looking for him, to which she replies "I don't know."

The group gets into the college and finds a medicine cabinet. Michonne takes what Bob tells her to get. They are chased by walkers down a hall and Tyreese throws a fire extinguisher through a window to escape. They climb out to the roof, but Bob trips and his bag is caught by walkers below. He gets his bag back, but Daryl opens it to find a bottle of alcohol inside. Daryl says that he will beat Bob into the ground if he takes one sip before the people at the prison get their medicine.

Michonne takes the driver's seat and tells Daryl that he was right. She has decided to quit running off to search for the Governor because the trail has gone cold. Daryl replies "good," and Michonne drives them back towards the prison.



"
Internment
"


Michonne, Daryl and the others return to the prison with the medicine shortly after the walker attack that night. Michonne is seen the next morning dragging bodies and stacking them in a trailer hooked to a Jeep. She asks Hershel if he'd like to help her and he replies "Hell yeah." They get in the vehicle together.



"
Dead Weight
"


When The Governor arrives at the prison, he discovers Michonne and Hershel outside the fences getting rid of the walker corpses from the previous night. He then aims his gun at the both of them.



"
Too Far Gone
"


While burning bodies outside the prison, The Governor appears and knocks Michonne out with the butt of his gun before holding Hershel at gunpoint, forcing him to drop his own gun. Michonne and Hershel are taken to The Governor's camp and kept tied up in his RV. The Governor tells them they will help him take the prison, and he explains to Michonne that he understands 
his daughter
 was dead. Michonne says she is going to kill him to which he replies that she won't. 

Michonne and Hershel are later revealed as The Governor's hostages when he tries to take over the prison. When The Governor partially decapitates Hershel with Michonne's katana, she is shown to be shocked. When the shootout between the two groups begins, she is able to roll away and tries to cut her bonds on a car bumper, killing one of The Governor's men in the process. 

As The Governor is choking Rick in the yard, Michonne plunges her katana through his chest. She helps Rick to his feet, who asks where Carl is, and she responds she doesn't know. As he stumbles off, she turns back and watches The Governor writhing on the ground clutching his chest. Instead of finishing him off, she leaves him to die in pain.



"
After
"


While escaping the prison, Michonne encounters the body of her horse, Flame, and creates two new pets from zombified members of the Governor's militia. She finds the freshly reanimated head of Hershel and puts the walker head of her friend down and mournfully caresses it while holding back her tears. After that, she leaves the prison and finds two fresh human footprints but decides not to follow the footprints and go off on her own into the woods. She finds a car and rests for the day inside of it. That night, she dreams of her former life with her lover Mike, his friend Terry, and her son. In her dream, things rapidly progress from their idyllic life to the devastation of the apocalypse, and she wakes up screaming.
The next day, while traveling with a walker herd under camouflage, Michonne repeatedly sees a walker who looks identical to how she would if she were dead. This realization causes her to snap and cling to her life. She heatedly executes the entire walker herd and begins crying. Finally, she follows the tracks Rick and Carl left behind and finds a bar with a dead walker and a note. She rests for a minute and begins talking to her dead boyfriend in her mind. She says she misses him and their son and that they could've lived and been with her. She continues following Rick and Carl's tracks, eventually finding them inside a house. With tears of joy she knocks on the door to be let in.



"
Claimed
"


Michonne joins Carl at the table in the house to eat cereal for breakfast. She remarks that she wishes they had soy milk, to which Carl shows disgust and tells her the story of how he tried soy milk in the third grade. He mentions that he would rather drink Judith's formula, but becomes upset at the mention of her name and leaves the room.

Michonne then joins Rick in the kitchen. Rick thanks her for making Carl laugh and says that Carl needs her. Rick says that if she ever needs a break from that responsibility to take it, but Michonne says that she is done taking breaks. Michonne asks if they will make the house their home or keep moving and Rick says that they will figure it out. Michonne says they need more supplies and that she will go with Carl. When Rick offers to come along she objects and convinces him to rest one more day. Rick tells Carl and Michonne to be back by noon.

Michonne notices that Carl is still quiet and obviously troubled by his Judith comment, so she tries to cheer him up. She reveals she found string cheese in one of the houses and covers her mouth in cheese while growling like a walker, trying to make him laugh. Carl doesn't laugh, and Michonne apologizes and says she isn't good at making boys his age laugh. She says she was better with toddlers. When Carl asks what she meant, Michonne reveals she had a 3 year-old son. Carl questions her further about it, but Michonne says she will only answer one question at a time, after they have cleared each room in the house.

Michonne reveals that her son's name was Andre Anthony, and that he was her only child, also remarking that he was a handful like Carl. The only detail she reveals about Andre's death is that he died shortly after the outbreak started. Michonne says that she has never told anyone about it before Carl. Carl says that her secret is safe with him, but Michonne says it was never really a secret.

While inspecting a painting, she notices a closed door and opens it up to discover a pair of children's rooms. In one of the rooms she discovers the bodies of two children and their parents. She closes the door before Carl notices what is inside. When he guesses that there was a baby in the room, Michonne lies and says it was a dog. Carl says that Rick let him name Judith, and that maybe Judith and Andre are together somewhere. Michonne smiles and agrees then says they should get back to Rick.

They encounter Rick later, who is on the run from the house because scavengers have taken over the neighborhood. They see a sign for 
Terminus
 and agree to follow the train tracks to the new location.

While she was gone, they'd gotten high and had been unprepared for a zombie attack, When she got back, Andre was dead, and they were dying. In her rage, Michonne let them turn, then turned them into her pets, to punish them, but also to punish herself for not protecting her son. Michonne tells him that he, Andrea, and Rick are the people who brought her back to being able to feel and have emotions. 

Once they go to Terminus,

, the leader, quickly greets them, checking their weapons before giving them back as a good will gesture. They offer the skeptical group something to eat.

Aaron assures that there is just one another person but that they came in two vehicles. Michonne goes with Abraham, Glenn, Maggie, and Rosita to go check out the two vehicles. After securing the vehicles, they return to the barn. Michonne convinces Rick to go with Aaron and the group sets off towards the supposed community, but not on Aaron's approved road, which he claimed is the only one that has been cleared. While they were driving in the night, Michonne, Rick, Glenn and Aaron together in the car and the rest in the RV behind them, Rick finds a microphone in the glove compartment and Michonne suddenly asks Aaron how many walkers he has killed; he responds, "A lot."

Later on, Michonne is talking to Rick on the porch about the vehicles they have left at the quarry, and how they can lead the walkers away from Alexandria's walls and spreading the walkers out in even directions. Rick suggests they bring most of their group with them, and to leave the Alexandrians where they are. But Michonne disagrees and explains that they are a community, and implies that they are all in it together.

"
Service
"


Michonne and Rick lie in bed, back to back. Michonne turns and gazes at Rick who she believes is sleeping before quietly slipping out of bed, getting dressed and retrieving a hidden sniper rifle from the living room fireplace before leaving the house as Rick watches.

Michonne sits on top of a rusty truck in the middle of a field. She scans her surroundings; the rifle rests on her lap. 

Michonne sits patiently on the rusty truck, waiting. When a walker comes into view, she aims her rifle at it and shoots, missing numerous times. She kills the walker out of frustration with her katana. She then finds a dead deer in the woods.

As the Saviors are preparing to leave Alexandria, Rick sees Michonne lurking in a dilapidated house nearby. Rick goes to her and tells her that he knows about her secret rifle and that he knew she was using it for target practice. He urges her to hand over the rifle, arguing that more people will die if the Saviors find an Alexandrian with a gun. 

Michonne marches into Alexandria carrying the deer she found as Rick gives Negan the rifle. Before they leave, Negan insists on taking the deer and Michonne drops it on the ground in frustration.

At home, Michonne approaches Rick as he spreads blankets on the bedroom floor, mentioning that the Saviors took most of their mattresses. Michonne assures Rick that she doesn't have any more secret guns. She reminds him that they've survived as long as they have because they always fight back, but Rick says there are too many Saviors -- "it's about the numbers." Michonne mentions the Hilltop, but Rick says that even with the Hilltop, they're still outnumbered. He reveals his thoughts on Judith not being his daughter, and he learned to accept that in order to keep her alive. He tells Michonne that she has to learn to accept their situation with Negan -- they all do -- or it won't work. "This is how we live now," he says. Michonne says she'll try to accept it. 

Michonne returns to the rusty truck in the grassy field. She sees a wisp of smoke in the distance and goes to investigate. She finds all the mattresses from Alexandria smoldering on the side of the road and rages with anger.

a Savior
 drives down a road, she is forced to stop when she reaches a barricade of walker corpses. She climbs out of the car to investigate and Michonne sneaks up on her, katana drawn. She forces her to drop her weapons and she complies. "Take me to Negan," Michonne orders as she holds her at gunpoint. Inside the car, the Saviors slams on the brakes, causing Michonne to drop the gun. As they struggle, Michonne overpowers her and again orders her to take her to Negan. She reluctantly replies.

Hearts Still Beating

Isabelle stops the car and the women can see hundreds of Saviors gathered in the distance. Isabelle tells Michonne an attack against Negan would be pointless. "We're all Negan," she says, then tells Michonne to shoot her and get rid of the car. Moments later, Michonne executes Isabelle and dumps her body in the woods.

That night, Michonne finds Rick in the basement cell. She tells him she wanted to join him and Aaron earlier, but she couldn't. She informs him that there are more Saviors than they thought, but that they should still fight. "For Judith, for Carl, for Alexandria and the Hilltop. For all of us," she pleads. Rick agrees with her, and they kiss.

Ezekiel
. Michonne accompanies the group to the 
Kingdom
, where they are reunited with Morgan and meet Ezekiel. While trying to convince Ezekiel to fight, Michonne tells him that Negan brutally killed their own people. They leave the next morning when Ezekiel refuses to fight.

On their way back to Alexandria, they encounter a blockade of cars on the highway set up by the Saviors. Michonne peers through her binoculars and spots something down the highway. They find a tripwire rigged across the road; a steel cable is stretched between two cars on opposite sides of the road, explosives carefully strung along the cable. As she helps to dismantle the explosives, a herd begins to approach. Michonne and Rick hotwire the two cars and drive down the highway, slicing walkers with the cord. They join the others and Michonne assures Rick they will make it. "We're the ones who live," she reminds him as they head back to Alexandria.

The Survivors return to Alexandria moments before 
Simon
 arrives with a group of Saviors. Rick innocently wonders why they are back so soon for tribute. Simon tells him they're looking for Daryl. The Saviors search Alexandria but come up empty. Simon notes that the pantry shelves are bare. Aaron explains that they’re having a hard time scavenging.

Once the Saviors have left, Aaron and Tobin inform them Gabriel disappeared with most of their food and weapons. Rick finds a note left from Gabriel and they head off to find him. They end up at a junkyard, where they are held at gunpoint by a large 
group of strangers
.



"
New Best Friends
"


Michonne is present as Rick tries to make a deal with 
Jadis
, the leader of the junkyard group. When she refuses, Michonne and the group are attacked but gain the upper hand until Gabriel defuses the situation by taking 
Tamiel
 hostage. Jadis wants to talk to Rick in private and Michonne protectively takes his hand, but he tells her it's OK. She asks where they are taking him and looks to the top of the trash heap, where Jadis pushes Rick into the trash below. Michonne yells at Jadis and looks through a tube to find Rick in the middle of a pit, where he is forced to fight a walker covered in metal armor and steel spikes. Michonne instructs Rick to use the walls and he is able to cover the walker in trash before killing it. He comes back to the group, injured but smiling, and tells them a deal has been made. Michonne hugs him and he kisses her head. 

Later, Michonne tells Rick that once he has been patched up, they will go straight back out to look for guns. Before they leave, Rick hands Michonne a cat statue to replace the one she lost.



"
Say Yes
"


Out in the woods, Michonne and Rick scavenge for guns to fulfill their deal with Jadis. In the van, they arrange the few supplies they've collected. Later, they come across Saviors golfing in a field. They spot batteries in the Saviors' truck. 

Back in the van, Rick powers up the dead walkie using the stolen batteries. Michonne suggests they return to Alexandria, but Rick convinces her to keep scavenging for another day and a half. 

As Michonne drives the van down a road, she looks at Rick and sees he's nodded off. She stops to make coffee as he sleeps. She spots a deer in the woods and quietly grabs a gun from the van. Rick wakes up and joins her. They search for the deer but then discover 
an abandoned school
. They bang on the fence, and the sound attracts a gun-bearing walker in combat uniform. After dispatching the walker, Michonne removes its gun. "Something serious happened here," she says. Rick inspects the shell casings on the ground and guesses they are about to find some "serious guns."

Michonne and Rick climb onto the waterlogged roof of the school to get a better view. They find the grounds decked out with carnival rides and swarming with walkers — all equipped with guns. "I think this is it," says Rick. In response, Michonne fires her rifle at a gaming booth in the distance, hitting its target. As they take in the scene, the roof below them caves in and they fall through. 

Michonne and Rick land on a bed, and burst out laughing at their immense luck. Michonne says it must be a sign. As they examine their surroundings, they see a large pile of boxes, each filled with canned goods and other supplies. 

Michonne and Rick open the crates and discover an abundance of non-perishable food rations. That night, they feast inside the school gymnasium. As they talk about the impending war, Michonne urges Rick to lead the communities after they defeat Negan. 

The next day, Michonne and Rick formulate a plan to close a gap in the perimeter fence and kill all the walkers. Rick shifts an abandoned car into neutral and they roll it toward the gap. The brakes fail. A walker with an automatic slung across its shoulders gets caught in some rebar; the trigger of the gun is caught in the metal, causing it to fire at them. Michonne jumps into the trunk as the car rolls through the gap and comes to a stop. Walkers swarm the car as they escape via the roof.

Michonne and Rick split up in order to divide the herd. Michonne witnesses Rick falling from the Ferris wheel and runs over to help but sees walkers feasting on fresh flesh and intestines. She freezes in shock and drops her katana, thinking Rick has been killed. Rick lunges out from the carnival ride and starts taking down walkers. He throws Michonne her katana and they kill the entire herd. Michonne jumps into Rick's arms and they hug. 

As Michonne and Rick gather guns from the school grounds, he sees her crying in the distance. Michonne sits in silence during the drive back to Alexandria. Rick pulls over. He warns her that they're going to lose people in the fight against Negan, possibly each other. He tells her it will be worth it, because it's not about them anymore; it's about the future. He asks her to lead the group if he doesn't survive.

Michonne and the others deliver 63 guns to Jadis. She demands nearly twice as many and Michonne reassures Rick they will find them.



"
Something They Need
"


After Tara tells Rick about the arsenal at 
Oceanside
, they lead a group of Alexandrians to the distant community. Michonne joins alongside them in order to acquire the guns and people to win the war against the Saviors. Rick helps Michonne climb a tree and asks if she's good, she replies she’s good enough.

Later, The Survivors set off the explosives near the Oceanside walls. They are able to round up the residents and Rick assures them that he doesn't plan to hurt anyone but they have something they need. 
Natania
 appears, holding Tara at gunpoint.

Beatrice
 suggests they join the fight but Natania refuses to lose more people to the Saviors.

Michonne warns Rick that walkers are approaching. The Survivors and the Oceansiders work together and take down the walkers. Beatrice hands Rick his knife back and they shake hands. Natania angrily concedes and allows the Survivors to take their guns but she remains unconvinced they won't fight.

The Survivors returns to Alexandria late at night and Rosita opens the gate for them. She leads them to the jail cell, where Dwight is waiting. Rick and Michonne hold Daryl back as he charges at Dwight. Rosita insists that he wants to help them, and Rick asks if that's true. Dwight says it is. Rick points his gun at Dwight and orders him to kneel.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"


Michonne is shown when Rick and the group interrogate 
Dwight
. Tara furiously reprimands him for murdering Denise, to which he replies that she was not his intended target. In response, Daryl slams Dwight against a wall and holds him at knifepoint. Dwight insists he's on their side and offers to work with them, saying his only reason left for staying with the Saviors, Sherry, is now gone. Tara tells Daryl to kill him, but he stands down. Dwight warns the group that Negan will come to Alexandria the next day with three trucks and at least 20 Saviors. Dwight presents his plan: he suggests they attack Negan and his crew while they're in Alexandria. 

Dwight heads back to the Sanctuary after the Survivors agrees to his plan. Jadis and the Scavengers arrive at Alexandria in a caravan of garbage trucks and bicycles. Rick greets Jadis inside the gate. She crudely propositions Rick, but is swiftly repelled. Daryl, Rosita and Aaron wire explosives in an empty cargo truck outside the Alexandria gate. Jadis asks Michonne if she and Rick are together before crudely propositioning him in front of a bewildered Michonne. On a balcony, Michonne gives sniper instructions to 
Farron
 (a Scavenger), and hands her a sniper rifle. "We win," Farron tells Michonne.

A Scavenger alerts everyone in Alexandria to the Saviors' arrival. Rick assumes his position at the front gate, with Jadis crouching by his feet, hidden from view. Negan's caravan arrives. Eugene steps out and tries to convince Rick to surrender. Rick hesitates, stricken by Eugene's betrayal, and asks where Negan is. "I'm Negan," Eugene replies. Rick then gives Rosita the signal to detonate the explosives. Rosita pushes the detonator, but there is no explosion. Before Rick can reach for his gun, Jadis leaps up and aims her gun at Rick. Simultaneously, the Scavengers all turn their guns on the Alexandrians. Negan emerges from a truck and taunts Rick as his Saviors open the truck that holds the explosives. Brion opens the gates for the Saviors. 

Michonne, watches in shock as the situation unfold, tries to leave her balcony post to help Rick, but Farron stops her, holding her at gunpoint and they fight to the death with Farron gaining the upper hand. She bashes Michonne's head into the ground, Michonne grabs a piece of a broken flower pot and stabs Farron. However, Farron still manages to overcome Michonne, attempting to throw her over the balcony. With all of her might, Michonne is able to overpower Farron and send her over the balcony to her death.

Rick and Carl look on in horror as a body plummets to the ground, from Michonne's balcony post.

As Negan prepares to strike Carl with Lucille, Shiva leaps onto and mauls a nearby Savior. Carol and Ezekiel arrive at the head of the Kingdom regiment in an attack, as Maggie arrives with the Hilltop fighters. A battle ensues as the Saviors and Scavengers are caught off guard. Rick and Carl join the fight. Negan orders a retreat as Shiva mauls another of his men to death. Before he escapes, Negan is surprised to see Maggie, alive and well, leading the Hilltop warriors. Negan and his men leave under a hail of bullets and gives his attackers the middle finger before escaping. 

Rick and Carl rush to where Michonne was last seen, and to their relief, they find Farron's dead body on the ground, where they expected to find Michonne. They discover her inside, badly beaten and barely conscious. Rick gently embraces her.

In the infirmary, Tara sits by Rosita's side, and Rick holds Michonne's hand as she rests in bed.

Michonne is horrified that Negan got out.

Carl comes up with a plan to try and get the people out. Michonne is against this, but Carl reminds her that it's "his show" saying that they need to escape and let Negan take Alexandria.

Rosita joins their conversation and suggests they all flee to the Hilltop while the Saviors destroy Alexandria above ground.

In the sewer, Carl talks to Michonne. He questions her leaving when she should've been resting, but says she looks great now. He pleads with her to stop the war. "It's not supposed to be like this," he said. "I know it can be better." Michonne looks to Rick and nods. Dwight tells Rick the Saviors are gone and they are ready to leave.

"
The Lost and the Plunderers
"


Michonne and Rick continue to mourn Carl. Rick hangs Carl's Beretta on his grave marker and ponders before taking the gun back and holstering it. As Michonne surveys the damage inflicted on the town, she dispatches several walkers that have made their way inside the walls. She notices that more walkers are making their way towards an open section of the wall and makes an attempt to seal it, to no avail. Michonne head back to their house, with her noticing two blue-paint handprints on the porch, Carl's and Judith's. She becomes emotional, touching Carl's print, before being forced to retreat inside at the sight of more walkers approaching the house.

As the two prepare to leave the sanctuary in the van, Michonne notices one of the gazebos burning, lamenting that Carl used to sit on the roof. She and Rick take fire extinguishers and attempt to stop the burning, but are forced to escape from an onslaught of walkers and leave the burning structure. They drive away from Alexandria, with Michonne taking one more look at the plaque hanging outside the gate.

Rick, showing concern, asks what is going through Michonne's mind. Michonne proposes they stop to read Carl's letters, but Rick refuses, still grieving. To her surprise, Michonne finds a letter addressed to Negan. Rick reveals his plan to talk to Jadis and sway her back to the fight, knowing that since she and the Scavengers were witnessed following Rick into the Sanctuary, they have become targets themselves. They arrive at the Junkyard, but find themselves trapped inside after triggering a trap, causing a large pile of garbage to fall and seal the door. 

Michonne and Rick desperately dig at the trash pile as the reanimated corpses of the Scavengers begins flooding in toward them. They both fight through the zombified Scavengers before they are forced up a mountain of trash. They find Jadis at the top, dressed in mourning and speaking clear English. Asked for a way out, Jadis simply directs them back where they came from. Rick blames her people's current fate on her and leaves her, deciding she's of no use to him anymore. Michonne and Rick push through the incoming walkers, putting down several with their shields before resorting back to their weapons. They manage to clear out enough garbage to open the exit. Jadis catches up to the pair, desperately seeking a way out. Rick points his revolver in her direction before turning his hand up and firing, warding her off. Jadis manages to squeeze out from the herd as they try to overwhelm her.

On the road to Hilltop, Rick explains to Michonne that it was not his intention to kill Jadis, but rather to drive her away. Michonne draws similarities from this to Carl's words before his passing. Rick stops the van and he steps outside and looks through Carl's notes, passing on his own in favor of Negan's.



"
The Key
"


Michonne and Rick arrive at Hilltop and reunite with everyone. Michonne is seen when Rosita retrieves the crate and gives Maggie the attached note, which offers them a "key to your future" in exchange for food and records. The note includes coordinates for a meeting point. 

Michonne rules this can't be the Saviors because they would blow through the gates for a big show. "What if it's someone who actually wants to help?" Michonne asks. Maggie suggests they simply miss out on the help rather than risk dying. Enid agrees. Michonne tells her the last time they trusted someone, it lead them to Alexandria, and Michonne wants to go to the meeting point, Maggie relents and she and Enid go with her.

Michonne, Maggie and Enid drive to the designated meeting spot and find two women waiting by a van. A third woman wearing a suit steps out and introduces herself as 
Georgie
. Her bodyguards are Hilda and Midge. Georgie explains that she can give Maggie valuable knowledge in exchange for food and records. Maggie takes them prisoner instead.

Michonne enters Maggie's office. She wants to make the deal and let them go before the Saviors arrive. Maggie, however, wants to keep all of the food. Enid wants to take their stuff or someone else will. She thinks people will die here and they should care more about themselves than anyone else. Michonne, however, points out that Carl rescued Siddiq and now they have a doctor and friend. Enid suggests being brave is what got Carl killed. Michonne warns her to leave, and Michonne argues with Maggie that Carl wanted them to be better people and she can't give up on that. Maggie reflects on this.

After Maggie agrees with Georgie's deal and she leaves, Enid talks with Michonne, expressing her skepticism of Georgie's vision. Michonne believes that Carl was telling them that there's more to building a future than simply fighting and tells her what Carl said "there's gotta be something after".

"
A New Beginning
"


A year and a half has passed since the end of the War.

In a rebuilt and thriving Alexandria, Rick, now with shorter and grayer hair, happily watches Michonne paint with Judith. They go outside the walls to see a flock of birds in the field.

Later that day, Michonne and the group go to the Smithsonian in Washington D.C, to search for a covered wagon and farming equipment. Inside, Rick tells everyone to be safe and the group separates.

While returning to the main stairs, Maggie tells Michonne and Carol that Gregory called for an election at the Hilltop and lost, making Maggie the rightful leader. Michonne smiles and then stops to look at a display of politics and how to unite different colonies.

Shortly after, the whole group reunites and gingerly uses ropes to drag an old covered wagon down the stairs and over the glass floor. The glass finally gives way and Ezekiel falls through it, dangling by the rope. Before the walkers can bite him, Daryl shoots at one and Rick and the others finally pull him to safety. Carol joyfully kisses him to celebrate.

The group leaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities.

On the road, Rosita and Daryl catch up with everyone to inform them that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Rick tells Tara, Gabriel, Aaron and Anne to head back to Alexandria and the rest will go to an alternate route and spend the night at the Sanctuary.

In the woods, the wagon gets caught in the mud as walkers appear from the bushes. It finally budges and everyone rushes to gather the supplies until the walkers overwhelm them and they're forced to leave. Ken runs back to free his horses but is bitten in the arm by a walker and then kicked in the ribs by the horse.

Siddiq and Enid try to save him but Ken succumbs to blood loss and dies from his injuries. A saddened Maggie sobs by his side before putting him down.

At the Sanctuary, Rick and the group arrive to deliver supplies. Michonne points out graffiti that proclaims, 
"We are still Negan"
, and Daryl demands Justin to clean it up. Rick promises to the Saviors that he'll continue to support them so they can get back on their feet. Everyone applauds him and treat him like a celebrity.

At night, Rick and Michonne settle into bed and Michonne asks if they did the right thing by letting Negan live. However, Rick stands by his choice. She then proposes that they create a charter between the communities: laying out guidelines and punishment. Rick agrees and tells her how lucky he is to have found her. They kiss and make love.

The next day, Daryl, Michonne and Rick arrive at the Hilltop to find the workers building gallows. Michonne is confused and asks Maggie what happened after seeing her bruised.

In the night, the residents, including Michonne and Rick, gather around the gallows as Maggie explains to her people that the punishment fits the crime. She looks on at Gregory, who has a noose around his neck and is sitting on a horse. Gregory pleads for someone to stop this, but no one moves. A couple of kids show up and Michonne yells for Maggie to stop but it's too late as Daryl smacks the horse and it rides off, leaving Gregory to hang to death to everyone's shock.

Maggie tells her people that she wants this to be the last time they do something like this. A shocked Michonne and Rick look on as Maggie then orders Daryl to cut off the noose.



"
The Bridge
"


In Hilltop, Maggie rides a horse as Michonne arrives. She tells Maggie that a planned food supply delivery hasn't arrived at the Sanctuary, but Maggie claims that the ethanol didn't arrive either.

Jesus confirms they have a surplus of food but Maggie counters that without a working plow it may not last long. Michonne suggests they let Earl out to repair it but Maggie scoffs and says she's fine with waiting for the fuel to show up from the Sanctuary. Michonne decides to stay to spend the night. 

Later, Michonne overhears as Tammy begs Jesus to see Earl but he says the time isn't right, reminding her he tried to kill Maggie. Tammy grabs a stool and says she's not moving until Maggie allows her to see him. Michonne arrives and tells Jesus to consider talking to Maggie about it, but he says it's not her concern. Michonne disagrees and proposes that they need to build something bigger than all of them.

A while later, Maggie tells Michonne she's open to creating common laws. She explains that her father, like Earl, used to drink and also deserved a second chance but Gregory got several chances and didn't change. Michonne smiles and tells her that Hershel indeed giver her a chance too.



"
Warning Signs
"


In Alexandria, Rick wakes up from bed and kisses Michonne. He places his hand over Carl’s handprint, before taking a stroll through the community.

Later, he returns to his house and thanks Michonne for being amazing and for everything she does. He suggests that they could find other ways of building for the future, implying having a baby. Michonne kisses him and they make love.

After Rick takes Judith to Siddiq to check on her, he and Michonne spend a family day with her playing, having a picnic and reading stories. Suddenly, Scott runs up and informs them that Maggie found Justin as a walker, but it doesn't look like an accident.



"
The Obliged
"


In Alexandria, Michonne spends her days doing various errands around the community before going out in the nights to kill walkers on the woods. One night, she finds a walker hanged on a tree, shocking her. She tears up and almost gets killed by another walker, but kills it with a bat. She looks at the bat in horror, reminded of Negan.

The next day, Nora warns Michonne that Negan has been refusing to eat and she promises to handle it. A while later, Michonne brings Negan a meal and he says he'll only eat if she stays to talk to him. She agrees to stay for an hour.

Negan tells Michonne he's not meant to be in the cell just as she's not meant to be doing random chores and looking after kids. Michonne shoots back that she's helping rebuild civilization. Negan admits he's happy his wife never got to see him like this, revealing that they wish they had a kid like Carl, but his wife got cancer and the world changed. Michonne says she sees Carl everywhere, and when Negan asks about her own kid, she angrily says Andre didn't make it. Negan says it's better this way because his wife wasn't made for the apocalypse. 
"We were built for more,"
 he says. Michonne reacts in anger and storms off.

A while later, Michonne returns to Negan's cell and acknowledges that they're similar but distinguishes that her worldview is a lot more positive than his. She finally gets him to eat, and as she leaves he asks her to see Lucille. Michonne tells him they don't have the bat anymore, claiming it's "still out there", which causes him to violently bang his head against the wall.

In their house, Michonne reads to Judith about baseball and gets triggered by a picture of a bat. She ignores this and playfully asks Judith for a kiss on her cheek.



"
What Comes After
"


In Alexandria, Michonne spends time with Judith and teaches her about shells, when Scott comes to inform her that Maggie has arrived.

Outside Negan's cell, Michonne stops an armed Maggie, who tells Michonne that Negan should have died under that tree and Michonne asks if this is what Glenn would have wanted. 
"I don't know what he would want, because I never got to say goodbye,"
 Maggie says. Michonne eventually gives her the keys to his cell and Maggie walks in. However, after a while, Maggie walks outside and Michonne seems pleased she didn't kill Negan. Suddenly, they get word about the shooting at the camp.

On the bridge, as Rick limps away before collapsing, he hallucinates as Maggie, Daryl, Carol, Ezekiel, and the others rush past him to kill the walkers. Michonne stops and sees Rick's wound. She reminds him she fell in love with him because he's a fighter. After killing the walkers, everyone stops to watch them. Michonne tells Rick how much she loves him and he tells her, 
"This isn't real."
 Michonne tells him to wake up and he does, now alone on the bridge.

The walkers approach as Rick hobbles away. He makes it across the bridge and turns around hoping to see the walkers fall through, to no avail. A walker makes its way inches away from Rick before getting shot in the head by a crossbow bolt. Rick watches as Michonne, Maggie, Daryl, and the rest arrive nearby.

Michonne and Maggie hatch a plan to divert the walkers but Rick won't allow it. He notices the dynamite on the bridge, takes aim, and says to himself 
"I found them,"
 before shooting and igniting the dynamite. The bridge ignites and explodes as Michonne and the rest can only watch in horror. Assuming Rick is dead, Michonne screams out while Maggie and Carol comfort her.



"
Who Are You Now?
"


Following Rick's presumed death, Michonne gave birth to a boy and named him 
R.J.
, in honor of her soulmate. She became Alexandria's leader and following her experience with 
Jocelyn’s group
, she became cautious and colder to newcomers, in order to protect her children and the community.

Six years later, in the woods, Michonne talks to Rick's presence at the destroyed bridge about the future and how life continues and time passes by. Elsewhere, she finds a toy sheriff figure in an abandoned car that reminds her of Rick and grabs it before leaving the place. 

Later, Michonne returns to Alexandria and doesn't look pleased to see the new arrivals. She frisks 
Magna
 and asks Eugene why they're here. Aaron claims it was his call, but Michonne reminds him it's not his call to make. 
"I decided,"
 Judith tells her. Michonne scolds her, but Aaron says they're here now and they should decide their fate together, while Gabriel suggests they vote tomorrow. Michonne agrees and instructs her people to put them in holding. She leaves as her sheriff figurine falls out of her pocket and Judith picks it up. 

The next day, Magna's group stands before the Michonne along the rest of the council for questioning. They ask who their leader is and Magna claims they're a team, while 
Luke
 explains their group used to be bigger. Gabriel asks about their former professions. Luke was a music teacher, Magna was a truck stop waitress, 
Connie
 was a journalist and 
Kelly
 was a high school student. Luke says they should trust them, but Michonne isn't done with questions. She stands up and asks Magna to see her left hand, which has a prison tattoo. Michonne then calls her out for the hidden knife on her belt, which she puts on the table. Michonne storms out, saying she'll second any of their motions. Magna tries to question her but is shut off.

In their house, Judith overhears Michonne pretending to talk to Rick, but Michonne catches her and tells her to do her homework and that they will train later.

At night, Magna sneaks around outside of Michonne's house with another knife. She opens the door slightly but sees Michonne hug a toddler, and leaves. A moment later, Magna goes over to the door and hands Michonne her knife, telling her she was right about her. Michonne tells her they all have done things to survive. She closes the door and then turns around to find Judith on the staircase with her father's gun. She says her dad would have wanted her to do what she did, and Michonne agrees.

Michonne tells her she'll understand one day why she's making Magna's group leave. Judith reveals she knows Michonne still talks to Rick and Carl while she's beginning to forget their voices, shocking her. As Judith leaves, R.J. runs up to Michonne and asks for food. 

The next day, Michonne smells one of Rick's old jackets and puts it on. Outside, Magna's group prepares to leave by thanking everyone for their hospitality. Michonne rides up and says she's going to instead escort them to Hilltop with Siddiq, making Judith smile at her mom for making the right choice. 



"
Stradivarius
"


On the road to Hilltop, 
Siddiq
 tells Michonne she should have let Magna's group stay in Alexandria, but she says she still doesn't trust them and is only doing this for her daughter. In the cart, Magna complains to her group that Michonne has her knives and she wants them back. 
Yumiko
 tells Michonne she's just upset about their lost friend, Bernie.

A while later, Michonne and the others arrive at Magna's giant crate of supplies, which have been displaced and destroyed by walkers. Magna's upset at the sight of Bernie's things while Michonne instructs 
D.J.
 to gather more of their weapons. This angers them, and Michonne also announces she's returning to Alexandria in the morning while Siddiq and D.J. help them finish the journey. Magna and Luke start to get riled up, but Yumiko calms them down and reluctantly agrees to her terms. They decide to find shelter for the night.

At night, inside a factory, Michonne hears a noise and finds Luke holding something. She thinks it's a weapon and tells him to drop it and turn around. Luke turns only for Michonne to slice his Stradivarius in half, waking up the rest of the group. 

Luke gawks at his broken Stradivarius in disbelief and explains to Michonne how old and rare it was. Yumiko lays her head on Magna's leg and playfully recalls the mansion they found it in. Luke says the Stradivarius is the one thing that separates them from the animals and how it brought humans together in the past, leaving Michonne in thought.

In the morning, Siddiq tries again to convince Michonne to come with them, but she says she can't take the risk with Maggie. Siddiq reveals to her that Maggie and Hershel left last fall, shocking her. Before he can explain, D.J. arrives to let them know that there walkers outside. The group gets out to find several walkers blocking the path to their horses.

Michonne kills several as Magna demands they get back their weapons. Michonne finally relents and orders D.J. to return them their weapons. As Magna's group splits up and take out several walkers, an undead 
Bernie
 appears, deeply upsetting them. A heartbroken Magna can't put him down, so Michonne does it for her. The group opens a clear path and leave.

On the road, Michonne empathizes with Yumiko and Magna, saying that she understands their pain of losing a friend considered family. Siddiq apologizes for not telling her about Maggie sooner, explaining that she and Hershel left with Georgie to help build a new community far away. 

Suddenly, two Hilltop soldiers ride up to them to inform that Rosita's injured and being cared for at Hilltop. Michonne instructs them to tell Hilltop they're on their way. Connie notices something nearby, confusing the group, but tells them it's nothing. As they leave, someone watches them from the bushes.



"
Evolution
"


At Hilltop, everyone runs inside as Michonne and Siddiq arrive with Magna and her group. From the guard post, Diane makes them all surrender their weapons before entering.

Inside, Tara coldly greets Michonne and updates her on Eugene, Aaron, Daryl, and Rosita's situations. She then informs Magna's group that they'll have to wait for Jesus to return before deciding on their future, but they can stay until he gets back. Connie thanks her for everyone. From the Barrington house, Michonne smiles at Carol but is ignored.

Later, Michonne introduces the new group to Carol, who happily introduces herself through sign language, which Connie appreciates. Carol asks Michonne about Judith and R.J. and then tells her about Henry moving to Hilltop. Carol asks if she can send a delegate from Alexandria to the fair but Michonne declines. Carol pleads but Michonne remains defiant and wishes her, Henry and Ezekiel well. 

In the infirmary, Siddiq apologizes to Michonne for keeping secrets from her. Suddenly, Rosita wakes up in a panic and tells them she knows where Eugene is. They tell her that Daryl and the others are already looking for him but get confused after she screams that the others don't know what they're dealing with. 

At night, Michonne, Magna and Yumiko arrive at the cemetery to help the others unlock the gate. 

Jesus tells Aaron and Eugene to get out while he finishes the walkers and starts taking out several with his sword. He goes to kill the last one but as he attacks it, the walker dodges and stabs him from behind through his chest, shocking everyone. 
"You are where you do not belong"
, the walker whispers to a shocked Jesus before throwing him onto the ground.

Daryl shoots it in the head as several more Whisperers arrive and the rest of the group run in to finish them off. As Aaron goes over to Jesus' body, Daryl notices something on the back of the walker's head and cuts into it, revealing a mask. Before they can process the situation, whispers around them get louder and the group circles up preparing for a fight. 



"
Adaptation
"


In the cemetery, Michonne and the rest proceed to kill the Whisperers and walkers around them. When more arrive they're forced to carry Jesus' body away and lock the gates. As they leave, a whisperer opens the lock.

On the road, Michonne tells Daryl they're bringing Jesus back to Hilltop so everyone can have closure and thanks him for helping her with everything. Suddenly, the group notices a small group of walkers nearby. Daryl corners them on a bridge and uses his crossbow to see who are whisperers. He hits one in the leg and the man falls down screaming in pain, attracting walkers to him. The rest try slowly escaping to the other side, where Michonne is waiting for them. They draw their knives and attack, but Michonne and the rest kill them with ease as the final whisperer gets on her knees to surrender. Daryl rips off her mask, to reveal a girl begging for her life. Michonne angrily questions her but when more walkers show up Daryl decides to take her with them.

Later, Michonne and the group arrive at Hilltop with Jesus' body and the captive girl, causing the whole community to react in disbelief. In the cellar, Daryl throws the girl in a cell and tells Henry that Jesus is dead. Michonne rips off her blindfold and tells her 
"No more bullshit!"


Michonne, Daryl and Tara interrogate the girl. She claims to not have a name and that her group were good people just trying to survive. Michonne asks if her people know about Hilltop but the girl begs to be left alone. Outside, Michonne tells Daryl and Tara she's heading back to Alexandria. Tara agrees and tells her she's going to allow Magna's group to stay because it's what Jesus would have done. Michonne secretly reminds Daryl that he knows what to do if the girl keeps refusing to talk.

Afterward, Aaron apologizes to Michonne for doubting her, affirming that Alexandria is self-sufficient enough without Hilltop. Michonne apologizes too and then informs Daryl that he should stay at Hilltop to help Tara and suggests he lead the effort in questioning the girl to ensure they don't lose anyone else.

A while later, a funeral is held for Jesus and everyone take turns hammering the nails in his coffin. Michonne looks in sadness and then proceeds to leave with the rest of the group to Alexandria.



"
Guardians
"


In Alexandria, Michonne scolds her council for keeping her in the dark about their radio mission. Gabriel argues they should be more open to new communities, but Aaron reminds him about the Whisperers and how they should trust Michonne's discretion. Siddiq argues that Michonne's not always right and her decision to cut ties with The Kingdom proves it. Michonne draws a hard line and asserts she's not willing to sacrifice her people to save the Kingdom. 

A while later, Michonne visits Negan at his cell to ask why he came back. He tells her how he could have bashed her head at her home but chose not to. Michonne surmises he actually tried to give the outside world a shot but was spit back out when he found nothing. He confirms her theory and suggests she start trusting him if she doesn't plan to kill him and that he could help with her counsel problems. She shuts him down and then sees Judith watching them from his cell window.

At their house, Michonne questions Judith on why she was spying on her earlier. Judith says she was actually there to see Negan, revealing she sometimes talks to him out of sympathy. Michonne calmly explains why that's a bad idea but Judith argues he actually listens to her. Michonne firmly demands she not go near him because he's a monster and if he got out he would continue to be a monster. Judith reminds her he did get out and wasn't a monster, proving he has changed. Michonne says people don't change but Judith responds, 
"You did"
, leaving her speechless. Michonne sends her to her room and then starts crying.

Later, Michonne visits Aaron to announce she has decided to let the council send a delegation to the Kingdom's fair. Aaron pushes back but Michonne says the people should be allowed to decide for themselves. 
"I hope we don't regret this,"
 Aaron says. 

Michonne then watches in thought as the residents prepare a caravan of food and supplies to send to the Kingdom for the fair.

In a flashback to moments after Rick's presumed death, Michonne returns to the riverbank and dig up his gun. At least eight months later, a now pregnant Michonne, returns and runs into Daryl. He tells her he followed the river to the ocean but hasn't found Rick. Michonne asks when he's going to return to Alexandria, but he says when he finds something.

In the present, Michonne cleans Rick's gun and puts it in a box marked "Judith." Suddenly, Aaron arrives at her house to inform her that Daryl's at the gates with Henry, Lydia, and Connie.

In the present, Michonne sits down to dinner with her kids. Judith refuses to eat and goes to her bedroom. The next morning, Michonne can't find Judith in her room, so she asks Negan if he's seen her and demands to know what Judith talks to him about. He says homework, stories about Rick, and how she's as much of a badass as Carl was. He also says she he is straight with her, and maybe if Michonne did she same she’d know where she is. She asks if he told her what he did to Glenn and Abraham, and he says he did. He reveals Judith hates that she's not letting Magna's people in and things should be like Carl wanted them to be. Michonne yells that Judith is her daughter, and Negan reminds her that means she'll take matters into her own hands. She rushes back home and finds a note from Judith saying she had to go to help their friends.

In the past, Daryl joins Michonne in her mission to find Judith and the missing Alexandrians in the woods. During a break, Michonne laments how stupid she was to trust her old friend, but Daryl reminds her some people just have too much evil in their heart.

Michonne sees Jocelyn in the hallway and demands to know where Judith and the rest of the kids are. As they argue, Gina points Michonne's own katana at her. Jocelyn leaves and orders her and Linus to kill her. Armed only with a pipe, Michonne says she doesn't want to kill them. Linus slices a massive cut on her pregnant stomach and Michonne screams again. She grabs her katana as the kids flee.

Michonne finds an exit and is immediately beaten over and over with a wooden plank by Jocelyn. Michonne summons the strength to stab her in her leg and the chest, killing her. Michonne gets up and tells the kids they can all return to Alexandria, but 
Mitchell

In the present, Michonne kills several walkers in the woods and finds Judith, saving her from a walker in time. They sit by a log and Judith tells her she remembers how the kids were nice to her but Jocelyn was bad. She then tells Michonne that loving someone means keeping them safe and asks why they stopped loving Daryl, Maggie, Carol, and the King. Michonne says they haven't, and the two hug again.

In the past, Michonne and Daryl return to Alexandria with the kids as the parents rush up to greet them. Back in the present, Michonne tells Judith how she changed Alexandria's mission to protect their own so she can keep her kids safe, but she admits she was wrong, and that they have to protect the people they love. 

In the woods, Michonne and Judith ride off towards Kingdom and pick up Daryl, Connie, Henry, and Lydia along the way. 



"
The Calm Before
"


Michonne and the group arrive at the Kingdom as the fair starts. She greets Ezekiel, who's shocked to see her. 
"I was in the neighborhood,"
 Michonne says. Carol and Ezekiel marvel at how much Judith has grown while Tara spots Lydia among the group. 
"The plan was to bring Henry…just Henry"
 Tara says angrily to Daryl.

Inside the theater, Michonne convenes the leaders and tells them she’s finally ready for Alexandria to help out. 
"We're here now,"
 she says. Gabriel announces Alexandria is willing to grant asylum to Lydia, but Tara warns if her mother retaliates it'll be against Hilltop. Michonne reminds her that none of them were trusted when they were first introduced to the Survivors, and Tara relents.

They all agree to send some of their own to Hilltop to guard against any potential attacks from the Whisperers and Michonne decides to re-establish the charter, establishing that an attack against Hilltop counts as an attack against all of them. Ezekiel then retrieves the original charter as Tara and Michonne finally make up. They all sign the charter, and Michonne tells Gabriel he should sign for Alexandria as the head of the council.

At the fair, Michonne informs Siddiq she's going to leave for Hilltop with the first group and he tells her he has some news to tell her when they're all back at Hilltop. She then leaves Judith to be looked after by Nabila. Later that day, Michone, Daryl, Carol, Magna, and others prepare to leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. In the woods, she and the rest encounter Ozzy, Alek, and D.J. and find one of Hilltop's carts overturned. She, Daryl, Carol, and Yumiko decide to track any possible survivor.

At night, Michonne and the group gets attacked by walkers. They take them out one by one until the Whisperers surround them. Beta emerges from the trees and tells them to drop their weapons. 
"You just had to give me the girl,"
 he growls at Daryl, telling him their deal is off. After the group is tied up, Alpha approaches them and tells them she ran into trouble on the road as she wipes her bloody knife on her pants. Michonne warns her if she tries to get Lydia back they'll respond in force, but Alpha assures her Lydia isn't her concern anymore. She takes out a shotgun and orders Daryl to follow her. 

At dawn, Daryl returns to the group and they leave back to the Kingdom. On their way back to the Kingdom, they find a beaten and bloody Siddiq tied to a tree. He points them to a nearby hill, which has ten pikes in the ground. Each spike has a severed head stabbed through the top. The group walk devastated towards it and look in horror at the victims: Ozzy, Alek, D.J., Frankie, Tammy, Rodney, Addy, Enid, Tara, and Henry. Michonne looks in sadness and is devastated at the loss of Tara. They then put down their friends and loved ones and head back to the Kingdom. 

Later that day, Michonne listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.   



"
The Storm
"


Several months after the fair massacre, Michonne leads a group of Alexandrians to help the Kingdom residents travel safely and move to the Hilltop. On the road, Yumiko informs her they've sent letters to Maggie but haven't heard back and the Hilltop is still reeling from the loss of another leader. Suddenly, they spot walkers in a field but keep moving undetected.

Later, as more snow starts falling, Michonne decides to take the group to the Sanctuary for shelter during the night. In the Sanctuary, Michonne and the other leaders map their route through a frozen lake on Alpha's land and she warns they have to leave now or they won't make it. Afterward, she accompanies a lonely Ezekiel and says if their communities knew each other better Alpha would have never blended in. Michonne vows to never let them get divided again and reminds him the Kingdom is here with them. The group gets ready and leave the Sanctuary.

In the woods, the group passes the pikes into Alpha's territory. Michonne kills frozen walkers, unsure if they're Whisperers or not, before reaching the frozen lake. Daryl notices Lydia's missing again, so Carol leaves to find her and instructs him to get everyone across safely. Suddenly, walkers awaken from the snow banks and the group kills them one by one before escaping across the ice.

In the morning, Michonne and the group finally arrive at Hilltop, where Daryl knocks off the head of a frozen walker. The next day, she, Daryl, and the others return to Alexandria, along with Carol and several Kingdom refugees. Michonne hugs her children and the group plays in a snowball fight. Later, she heads to the infirmary to visit Negan. She thanks him for saving Judith and he muses that last time they were there Rick had just slit his throat.

Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Michonne and the Coalition form a militia in order to train the several residents of the communities to face any future threats. She takes part in a training exercise on the Oceanside beach. As Ezekiel and Jerry methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Michonne and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat. 

Later on, Michonne and Daryl laud the results of their training session. 
"Tara would have been proud,"
 Daryl says. They also comment Rick would've loved the fact that the children are seeing the beach for the first time. A while later, Michonne listens as Aaron radios Gabriel at Alexandria to warn him about the recently discovered Whisperer mask at the beach, suggesting they go on lockdown. Michonne instead advises they stay vigilant while they split up and look for more signs of the Whisperers.

On the hunt, Aaron asks Michonne if they're the good guys, reminding her they're the villains in other people's stories. Suddenly, he spots walkers on a bridge and rushes in to kill them. Michonne saves him and angrily reminds him not to cross into Alpha's border. However, Aaron reminds her about the people they've lost and claims he is tired of being nice. Michonne reiterates he still needs to be careful.

Michonne then radios everyone to circle back but Yumiko tells her they have found something. In the woods, they catch up with her and find an abandoned campsite full of corpses and a walker skin. Aaron declares one of the Whisperers has been here. At Oceanside, Michonne explains to Aaron that people can't be afraid because of how fear will impact the community. She also tells him they have to choose to be the good guys, even when it's hard.

Michonne then overhears Judith telling R.J. the story about Rick blowing the bridge to save his friends. 
"He died and went to heaven,"
 Judith tells R.J. about "the brave man" in her story. Michonne tears up and walks up to hug them, telling them she'd do anything to protect them. Suddenly, an explosion rings out and everyone looks up to witness streaks of fire cascading from the sky.

That night, Michonne and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. The group runs out of water as a herd of walkers approaches the group. With their backs to the fire, the group prepares for a fight.

Michonne and the group take their formations and start fighting off the herd. As they keep killing the walkers, Daryl tosses an axe to cut a tree down and have it fall onto some walkers. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers. Eugene asks Michonne if he can scrap the satellite for valuable parts and she grudgingly agrees, making everyone help out. She then asks Aaron where Daryl and Carol went.

Ghosts
"


Michonne and the rest of the Alexandria residents face against waves of walkers pouring onto the community gates over the next 49 hours. After prevailing from the exhausting battle, Michonne checks on her children even though Judith reminds her it's not safe to go to sleep. She gets a call on her radio and discovers that a new herd of walkers is approaching from multiple directions. In the morning, Michonne helps to clean up the community from the corpses while Eugene warns that it will be an hour until the next wave hits. She is tired and Daryl feels her frustration. Suddenly, 
Mary
 arrives at the gate to tell them to go to the north border, lay down their weapons, and wait for Alpha. Michonne asks her to call off her walkers but she swears they're not theirs.

Later that day at an emergency council meeting, Michonne tells the residents that attacking the Whisperers without a proper plan is not smart due to the large herd in Alpha's possession. She then tells everyone instead of retaliating, she and a small group will meet with Alpha at the border to work things out. Michonne then divides a plan: Gabriel will lead a group against the northern wave, Aaron will handle the southern wave, and she will take a group to the border.

That night, Michonne and the group arrive at the border and lay down their weapons. Alpha arrives with some Whisperers and reminds them to stay off her land. Michonne explains the fire would have wiped out Oceanside and they only crossed one time, but Alpha reminds her of two other times they trespassed. She declares that there will be no bloodshed, and instead she's moving the border up as punishment. Carol says they don't have to listen to her bullshit. 

Daryl tries to get her to leave but Alpha says not until Carol lowers her eyes to her feet. Alpha tells Carol she should fear her but Carol says she feels nothing at all. Alpha reminds her how Henry feared her before she beheaded him, causing Carol to pull out her gun and shoot. Daryl manages to hit her arm so she misses as the Whisperers draw their weapons. Michonne apologizes to Alpha for Carol's behavior and Alpha says she forgives her "mother to mother." Back in their camp, Carol tells Michonne, 
"Bitch has to die."
 Daryl tells Michonne she hasn't been the same since the boat. Suddenly, Michonne and the others hear Carol shooting and she claims she spotted some Whisperers nearby.

After searching around the woods, Michonne suggests to Carol that the pills she is taking is affecting her, but Carol brushes it off. The group then arrives at an abandoned school to rest. A while later, Michonne and the others hear Carol's cries for help and enter the gymnasium to find her standing on top of several walkers she has killed. She and the rest decide to head back to Alexandria so Carol can be treated at the infirmary and rest properly. After Siddiq and Dante inform Michonne and Daryl Carol's doing well, they take her home so she can sleep.

The next morning, Michonne approaches Siddiq and asks if he's doing ok. He claims he's just tired, so she leaves to visit Carol. When Michonne talks with Carol, she swears she saw those Whisperers, but Michonne says no one else saw them. She then returns to her house to rest alongside her children. Judith is looking after R.J. as Michonne lays in bed with them. She explains that it is safe for now. 



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Michonne and her children dine together and share a laugh as they are joined by Daryl. The following morning, Michonne leaves R.J. in charge of Daryl as she leads a convoy towards Hilltop to help out the community after a tree has fallen down. On the way, Michonne tells Judith never to take enemies by their word. Judith suggests the Whisperers are probably trying to tire them out like R.J. does before he goes to sleep, impressing her mother. Suddenly, Michonne spots Ezekiel riding into the woods alone and orders the group to continue while she investigates. 

Michonne enters the woods as Ezekiel's horse gallops past her. She then finds him on the edge of a cliff pondering suicide. Michonne hugs him and tells him it's ok, prompting him to kiss her. After a few seconds, he pulls away and apologizes. They then sit together to talk. Ezekiel jokes to Michonne they could have been together in another universe and reminds her how much he lost. She admits she was once jealous of walkers, wishing they would bite her. She also tells him that everything gets better in the end as she remembers Rick, causing her to tear up. They then return to their horses and Ezekiel thanks her for her advice and support. 

Later that night, Michonne and the convoy arrive to help the Hilltop residents fight off the invading walkers. While fighting, Michonne takes notice of Judith taking out walkers by herself and smiles at the idea of her daughter following her steps. Once the fight is over, Daryl radios Michonne to update her on the situation regarding Negan's fate. Michonne asks if she should come home but Daryl tells her to stay as long as Hilltop needs her. Michonne then tells him Lydia has to stay regardless of the outcome because she believes Alpha will be harsher with them if Lydia's gone since she confided her daughter's safety in Daryl. She then asks him to be her proxy on the council vote. Before signing off, she receives an emergency call from Oceanside asking for assistance due to reports of Whisperer activity.

The following morning, Michonne announces in a meeting she will be delivering supplies to Oceanside after receiving reports of potential Whisperer activity. She also decides to take Judith with her after she proved herself in the battle. Later that day, Michonne and a group prepare their convoy and head out on their journey towards Oceanside.



"
The World Before
"


Michonne and the group continue their journey towards Oceanside when they stop briefly after Scott comes across recent footprints on their path. She tells the group to stay alert and remain quiet to avoid encountering Whisperers scouts. When Luke suggests stopping at a nearby library along the way to look for more books, Michonne opposes at first but eventually accepts after Judith complains that she has already read almost every book back in Alexandria.

When the group heads inside the library, Michonne receives a message from Magna where she is informed about Siddiq's death and that Dante was an undercover Whisperer. Upon hearing Luke screaming for help, she and the group find him in the music section where he explains he was saved by a man before he fled. Michonne takes the man's backpack that was left behind and then informs Luke of Siddiq's death.

Later that day, the group arrives at Oceanside and Michonne informs Cyndie and Rachel about the recent events. She then asks them about the arrival of newcomers in their community, explaining that Dante arrived at Alexandria before the satellite crashed. As she suggests to use another system to vet newcomers, Michonne witnesses as the residents bring the man that saved Luke to the camp and accuse him of being a Whisperer. While the stranger begs he simply wants to get back to his family, Michonne draws her sword and demands he answers her questions. When walkers suddenly invade, she helps take out the threat and congratulates Judith after she stops the man from escaping.

That night, Michonne questions the man about his motives. He claims he was only looking for supplies and now wants to return home. When she asks why he saved Luke, he says that mercy is in short supply these days. She gets emotional after remembering a similar phrase said by Rick and Siddiq years before. He then reveals to live with his family on a fortified island that is hard to find. They make a deal in which Michonne will help him get back to his family in exchange for weapons. Shortly after, she tells Judith her plan and they hug when she says she needs to go alone.

The next day, Michonne gives 
Virgil
 his backpack and tells him that the weapons will pay off his debt to Oceanside. He accepts the offer and they introduce each other before shaking hands. Michonne then informs the group of her mission and that she has a radio if they need her. She tells Judith that she can contact her at any time and reminds her to be good with her uncle Daryl until she returns. Michonne and Virgil then sail away on a boat towards the island.



"
What We Become
"


Michonne and Virgil have finally arrived to Bloodsworth Island after 5 hours of travel. Virgil complains about being tied to the railing during the trip, but Michonne pays him no mind. Virgil takes her inland, where he claims both the weapons and his family are located. On the way, he stops to pick flowers and herbs to make tea, much to Michonne's annoyance. Wishing to retrieve the weapons as soon as possible, Michonne asks if there are any in the building adjacent to them, but Virgil says this is just an old lab, adding that it's best to stay away due to the wildlife infestation. Further on, the pair arrive to an empty camp. Suspicious, Michonne notes that none of Virgil's family is there. When Virgil becomes evasive, Michonne pulls her sword on him and threatens him into telling the truth. Virgil obliges and takes her to three empty graves, revealing his family to be dead. Angry at Virgil's half-truths, Michonne storms off to find the weapons herself, but stops when Virgil blurts out the island isn't clear. He claims that the island was invaded by a group who brought violence and disease, the latter of which killed his family. He asks for Michonne's help to put his family down, explaining that he never really got good at killing walkers since the island is quite isolated. Michonne reluctantly agrees.

The pair sneak into the walker-infested building through a back door. It isn't long before they are forced to squeeze through a makeshift barricade. While Michonne is successful, Virgil gets stuck and accidentally knocks the barricade over, alerting the walkers to their location. Michonne pushes the walkers back with a stretcher, before instructing Virgil to stay behind it while she takes care of the walkers. After Michonne successfully kills all of the undead, Virgil finds his reanimated family hanging from the ceiling in another room with a bunch of others, having committed mass suicide. Virgil tearfully puts his wife's shoe back on, then allows Michonne to put his family down.

After Virgil buries his loved ones, Michonne expresses her condolences, but is anxious to resume the search. Virgil says that it's late, meaning the tide is too low for the boat to travel though the channel. When Michonne remains adamant, he adds that its getting dark and some of the buildings aren't safe. He offers to resume the search in the morning, which Michonne reluctantly agrees to. As night falls, Michonne finds herself unable to sleep. She attempts to contact Judith, but only receives static. She then ventures outside and goes to explore the lab building Virgil told her to stay away from. When she enters a room, Virgil suddenly appears behind her and slams the door, locking her inside. He chastises Michonne for breaking their trust, before slamming the shutter on the door's window and walking away.

Michonne tries in vain to pry the door open, but eventually tires out and falls asleep. When she wakes up, she finds a tray of food on the ground and her sword missing. She continues to bang on the door, when a strange voice from a cell next to hers tells her to calm down. Shocked, Michonne asks how long she spent in the cell asks why the people on the other side didn't answer her before. They tell her that it's been roughly a day since she arrived, and that they didn't answer her out of fear, since Virgil was in one of his moods. They also dissuade Michonne from trying to escape, as the whole building is booby-trapped. The trio introduce themselves as Virgil's former colleagues who worked as researchers on the island before the outbreak, while Lucy was a janitor. They explain that after the outbreak, people kept arriving to the island via boat, but food supplies soon dwindled. Eventually, a fight broke out over the rations, which resulted in a resident getting stabbed to death. Virgil arrived to the scene too late and panicked. He ordered his colleagues to lock all the doors, but didn't realize his family was still inside. Driven insane over causing their deaths, Virgil locked his friends in the cell so they wouldn't leave him. One of the captives, Jeremiah, encourages Michonne to eat, so she has the strength to kill Virgil. Another captive, Celeste, asks for Michonne's name, so she introduces herself before biting into an apple.

Later, Virgil opens the shutters and tells Michonne he is glad she ate. Michonne orders him to open the door, but Virgil declines, as he knows she will kill him if he does so. He tells her that he doesn't want to fight, just wants her to understand, explaining that the island has a gift and that it can help her the same way it helped him. At this point, Michonne begins to hallucinate. When asked what he did to her, Virgil reveals that he made her hallucinogenic tea using Jimsonweed. He believes Michonne to be in pain like himself, and wishes to cure her. Michonne denies being like Virgil, but the latter cuts her off, revealing that they've already had that conversation three times. Michonne pleads with Virgil to think about her daughter and son, but Virgil says that no one listened to him when he said the same thing, and goes on to state that everything he did was for his family. Michonne laughs at this and makes a snide remark, but is surprised when Siddiq replies to her instead and asks about his child. As Michonne's hallucinations continue to get worse, Virgil smiles and tells her she is no angel. When Michonne starts to shiver, Siddiq tells her to picture the sun. Michonne is at first glad to see him, but he starts blaming her for his death, as well as the deaths of Rick and Carl. Siddiq then asks what will happen to his family with him gone. Michonne tearfully states that Siddiq is her family, but the latter replies "this is what it feels like to be your family". A split send later, Michonne's hands are covered in blood. Michonne screams in horror, before she is confronted by a past version of herself, who hands her the chains to her walkers. Prompted by Virgil, Michonne takes the chains.

She is violently yanked into a vision where she watches Andrea get devoured instead of helping her. She loots Andrea's body before moving on. Later, Michonne finds herself in place of the hitchhiker she and Rick left on the road. As she walks down the road, a Hyundai Tuscon speeds past her. She yells for it to stop, but is ignored. Later, she catches up with the car after it is stuck in the mud. Once again, she begs for help, but upon spotting her, Daryl tells the others to move on. Michonne is once again abandoned. Michonne then finds herself in the aftermath of a walker attack. Just as she finishes the last one off, she is approached by Negan and the Saviors. Michonne takes a swing at Negan with her sword, but he dodges and knocks her down with Lucille. Despite Michonne's aggression, Negan takes a liking to her and offers her a chance to join his group, which she accepts. Michonne then finds herself present at the outpost that Rick and his group initially attacked in an attempt to wipe out the Saviors, but this time on the other side. As Glenn and Heath sneak up on Laura and kill her in her sleep, Michonne is able to wake up in time and guns them down. She successfully escapes the outpost. Later, during the infamous lineup, Negan begins his "eenie-meenie-miney-mo" chant to pick which of the survivors will be executed, but then decides to hand the bat over to his "right-hand-gal" Michonne, allowing her to chose instead. Michonne admonishes Rick and his group for slaughtering the Saviors in their sleep, despite knowing nothing about them. After picking her victim, Michonne states that what happens next is their fault. The victim turns out to be Michonne herself, as "Savior Michonne" tells the survivors "Welcome to the new world", before swinging. Finally, Michonne finds herself being chased through a forest by the Militia. She kills two of them, before she is abruptly shot in the chest by Daryl with his crossbow. As she lay dying, Rick approaches her and shoots her in the head with his Colt Python.

Finally sobering up from the tea, Michonne throws up in a bucket. Virgil asks if she is feeling better while offering a glass of water. Michonne drinks, before grabbing a fork off the tray and suddenly stabbing Virgil in the calf. As they struggle, Michonne is able to disarm Virgil, but he is able to get away. Michonne quickly frees the other prisoners. Together, they run to the boat, only to find that Virgil has set it ablaze. It isn't long before the former captives catch up with Virgil. As Michonne tackles him and puts a knife to his throat, Virgil explains that he was originally going to ask Michonne to help him release the prisoners, as he wanted to let them go but needed Michonne to keep them from killing him. Once Michonne discovered them on her own, however, Virgil realized she would join forces with them to kill him, so he needed to take her captive as well. Virgil apologizes, but Jeremiah doesn't accept his apology and spitefully steps on his injured leg. Virgil goes on to state how he was lost after his wife died and couldn't let the prisoners leave, but didn't want to kill them either. The prisoners urge Michonne to kill Virgil. Michonne considers it, but seeing the sorry state of her former captor, she ultimately relents. She tells the others that Virgil owes them more than he can ever repay, but by killing him, they will lose more of themselves. Showing mercy, however, will bring them peace. Lucy proceeds to knock Virgil out.

Virgil wakes up in one of his cells. Michonne brings him some water and angrily tells him that she checked every building on the island and found no weapons. Virgil points out that he never lied to her about the weapons, and only said that he'd show her the spots where they could be stored, although he admits he never went inside these buildings because he didn't need to, adding that he never found anything other than a stray shell here and there. He offers Michonne a chance to take anything else she wants instead. Michonne spitefully throws him a bottle of water, before asking him what he sees when he is tripping on his tea. Virgil says that he sees his family alive again, which he describes as heaven. He tells Michonne that he wanted her to experience something similar. Michonne, however, reveals that the tea took her family from her, and she saw hell instead. Virgil apologizes, explaining that the only world he ever wanted to live in was the one with his family in it, but doesn't know how to go on without them. Michonne tells him he needs to try, like everyone else, before ordering him to show her his stuff. Obliging, Virgil takes her to a closet with various equipment inside. As she looks through the shelves, she spots a pair of boots, which she immediately recognizes as Rick's. After a moment of shock, Michonne suddenly pins Virgil to the wall and interrogates him about where he got the boots.

Virgil takes her to a boat that washed up ashore during a big storm. Michonne frantically searches through the journals aboard, before discovering an iPhone with an engraving of her and Judith. Michonne cries tears of joy upon realizing Rick survived the explosion, but turns her attention towards Virgil a few moments later. She thinks he came to find them at Oceanside because of the engraving, despite Virgil's claims that he'd never seen it. Furious, Michonne interrogates him about what he did to Rick, but Virgil has no idea who she's talking about. After Michonne relents, Virgil offers help restore the boat to working order if the others would help him. Later, as the others pack up, Michonne informs Virgil that the others are willing to let him come along. Virgil is surprised by this, and considers it for a moment, but ultimately decides to stay on the island to be with his family.

As the boat sails north, Michonne cries over the realization that Rick might still be alive. She then radios Judith. Judith says that she'd been trying to reach Michonne. Michonne apologizes and informs her daughter that she found three people on the island, whom she is bringing home. R.J. joins in on the call to say hello to his mother, but Judith tells him they need to use codenames for security, so R.J. chooses "Little Brave Man" as his codename, much to Michonne's delight. Michonne asks about Rosita, before switching the topic to the Whisperers. Judith informs her that the Whisperers are finished, as they eliminated most of the horde, while Alpha can't hurt them anymore. Michonne then reveals that she found something that belonged to the "Brave Man", and where he might have been recently. Choking back tears, Judith asks if Rick is still alive, but Michonne doesn't know. Judith then urges Michonne to go find Rick if she thinks he is alive. Michonne initially declines, reasoning that Judith and R.J. need her right now, but Judith is insistent, telling Michonne that Rick could be trying to come home and might need help. Michonne accepts her mission, and tells Judith that she will try her on the walkie for as long as she can. They then say their goodbyes.

Later on, Michonne sneaks up behind two walkers and amputates their arms and jaws. She then continues her journey dragging the walkers behind her on a leash, similarly to how she did with Mike and Terry. She travels until she happens upon two survivors, one of them injured. She approaches them, blade in hand. The survivors plead with her to help them, as "they" won't wait for the pair. When Michonne asks who "they" are, the pair point to a large column of survivors moving in the distance. Remembering how she and Rick first met and how he decided to help her, Michonne ultimately decides to do the same, and offers a hand to the survivors. Together, they make their way towards the convoy.

Years
"


In a dream, Rick swears as he looks around a park and is greeted by Michonne who is eating lunch on a nearby bench. Rick explains that he's not from the area, and is late for work, asking Michonne for help with reading his map. An amused Michonne gives Rick directions, and he sits next to her, asking about Michonne's work. Michonne admits that it's not where she wants to be and asks if Rick is where he wants to be which Rick confirms.

In a continuation of the previous dream, Michonne prepares to leave, but suggests that they meet up there again as she eats in the park every day around this same time. Rick attempts to ask for Michonne's name, but he is awakened from his dream by Okafor.

In another dream, Rick sits with a pizza waiting for Michonne, offering to share it with her or to return to his miserable job. Michonne admits that she does like pizza, but she orders Rick to shut up about his misery as he's not stuck anywhere. Michonne isn't where she wants to be, but she's not stuck either. They can make this whole world theirs if they want to. Rick suggests that he could come there one day with five pizzas and a wedding ring, an idea that Michonne likes. As they kiss and Michonne tells Rick that she believes in him, the dream turns into a nightmare with Michonne catching on fire and Rick reliving bad memories ending with the bridge explosion.

After Nat crashes a CRM helicopter, Rick orders the Front Liners to prepare to engage, but two more explosives fling the men to the ground, killing two and stunning Rick and two others. A figure armed with a 
katana
 finishes off the other two men and disarms Rick, only to stop after removing his helmet. The attacker turns out to be Michonne who removes her mask and Rick and Michonne stare at each other in shock, reunited for the first time in years.

Gone

Six years after the 
bridge
, 
Michonne
 introduces herself to 
Elle
, the leader of the 
Nomads
. 
"My name is Michonne. I lost someone, years ago. But I just found out that he might... I just found out that he's alive. I saw two people who needed me, your people, and I helped them. That's it. No other reason. No agenda"


In flashbacks, 
Rick
 blows up the bridge while 
Carol
 and 
Maggie
 hold the devastated Michonne. Michonne 
later
 finds Rick's belongings and the phone with the message on it on 
Bloodsworth Island
 and 
Boat 672
 as well as the boat's last location in the log book of 
Bridgers Terminal
 in New Jersey. While searching for Rick, Michonne finds and helps 
Aiden
 and 
Bailey
, members of the caravan who had needed her help.

Finishing her story, Michonne tells Elle that she sees what the caravan has and, facing a long journey in front of her, asks for their help, promising that she'll understand if the caravan can't give it to her. In particular, Michonne wants a horse. Elle thanks Michonne for what she did, but she wants to get to know Michonne first and tell her about their community. Michonne is impressed by the caravan, but she's more interested in continuing her search for Rick. Elle suggests that Michonne could be an asset to the caravan if she can't find Rick, but Michonne is uninterested and moves to leave with Bailey telling Elle to just give her a horse. Elle apologizes for offending Michonne, revealing that Aiden and Bailey are Elle's sister and her sister's boyfriend. Annoyed, Aiden tells her sister to just give Michonne a horse, but Elle continues that Rick and Michonne could be a part of this community if her search is successful. However, Michonne tells Elle that they already have a 
community
 and kids who need to see their father and who Michonne has to see again.

Elle asks where she needs to go, and Michonne explains that it's a place called Bridgers Terminal and it's located to the north. Elle warns Michonne that she doesn't want to go north now, and suggests that Michonne stay with them until the migration is over. Bailey explains that the millions of people who used to live in the Tri-State Area are now the Wailing as the caravan refers to the undead. The caravan doesn't know why, but at this time of year, a lot of herds move south. In a couple of months, they will move north again, and it will be safe then. Elle encourages Michonne to stay with and get to know them for a little while, but Michonne recalls how the caravan won't stop for anyone ever, not even the leader's own sister. Elle defends that they're a community that lives by the same rules and they don't stop, worried that saving 2 people could cost them 200 people instead and it's how they've survived. Michonne points out that that doesn't sound like a community and, because of that rule, not everyone has survived. Disgusted, Michonne prepares to leave, with or without a horse.

Nat
 storms in and confronts Elle about the rear guard stopping Nat from trying to go after his friends because he keeps the caravan going, not noticing that Aiden and Bailey are in the room with him. Nat furiously states that he's packing his wagon and all of his 
"toys"
 and leaving, reminding Elle that Aiden was her sister, and the couple was his friends. 
"This system is bullshit, Elle. We're strong enough to stop. We're strong enough to save people. What the hell is the point otherwise? I mean, Jesus Christ, she was your sister."
 Aiden catches Nat's attention and the three are happily reunited. Bailey explains that he'd hurt his ankle while Aiden introduces Michonne as the person who had saved them.

Nat is stunned that Michonne simply helped them and brought them back just because Aiden and Bailey had asked for her help. Thankful, Nat offers to let Michonne ride VIP with them, but Michonne states that even if she didn't have somewhere to be, she doesn't leave people behind, something that Nat agrees with. After Michonne tells Nat where she needs to go, he calls it a stupid plan because of the migration of five mile wide hordes of walkers, but Michonne is undeterred. Seeing this, Nat promises Michonne her pick of horse over Elle's objections.

Heading outside, Michonne tries to contact 
Judith
 on the radio, explaining that she's just trying to be home in some way until she can go back. Nat leads Michonne to his trailer where she spends the next hour trying to raise Judith without success, professing her love for her daughter. Nat returns, telling Michonne that she needs more than a horse and he needs more than an hour. Without it being almost nightfall, Nat suggests that Michonne spend the night with them before leaving on her mission. Aiden and Bailey bring Michonne Elle's horse which is one of the best and who they have stolen for her. Nat pleads with Michonne to spend the night so that he can properly equip her and show Michonne how to use the equipment properly, suggesting that 
"maybe you'll survive 30 more seconds of your trip once you hit the Delaware border."
 Michonne agrees to stay the night and to leave at dawn, and an excited Nat starts giving Aiden and Bailey orders on crafting something while he walks Michonne through the 
screamsticks
.

The next morning, Michonne prepares to set out, equipped with the horse, armor made custom made for her by friends and some of Nat's inventions. Aiden has faith that Michonne is going to find Rick as she found Bailey and Michonne then found them, calling it a circle. Nat questions her mission, pointing out that Rick blew up on a bridge years ago, admitting that Aiden, Bailey and Michonne are the only people that he can stand, and Nat doesn't want to lose any of them. Michonne points out that the caravan leaves people to die, and asks why her friends stay with them. Nat admits that he didn't like it before the world ended either, but they did the same thing then. Michonne points out that it's not before anymore and they're all too smart not to find another way. Nat suggests that they're all 
"surprisingly stupid,"
 but Bailey admits that they're just too scared to change. Michonne tells Aiden, Bailey and Nat that she's glad to have met them and they wish each other luck before Aiden and Bailey leave. Recalling that Michonne's kids are in 
Virginia
, Nat warns her that she can keep trying the radio, but Michonne will be out of range soon if she isn't already. Nat gives Michonne a journal to write letters to her kids in that she can show them when she gets home.

Michonne decapitates a passing walker and finds a massive miles wide horde blocking a valley on her way north. Michonne 
rides at the horde
, stopping close to it and shooting a screamstick - a spear-tipped firework like explosive created by Nat - into the horde, creating a large explosion that the walkers are drawn to. As Michonne prepares to fire again, the Gasman emerges from the horde and explodes, his 
flying head
 knocking Michonne off of her horse which runs away. Drawn by the second explosion, the herd turns again and begins moving towards Michonne who draws her 
sword
. Suddenly, two explosions send purple flames high into the air to either side of the valley and the herd splits, each half going towards one of the explosions, slowly opening the path for a stunned Michonne.

Turning around, Michonne finds several of the caravan's vehicles and Aiden and Bailey leading Michonne's horse back over to her. Bailey explains that they didn't want to be afraid and stupid anymore and left the caravan with others who felt the same way to look for her. Aiden tells Michonne to wait with them while the horde splits, stating that the fires are going to burn on either side of the valley for awhile. Bailey offers Michonne a 
beer
 while they wait.

At night, the 
Nat's Group
 camps out and Michonne's friends tease her about getting knocked off of her horse by the Gasman. Michonne asks about the purple light, and Nat explains that he had an idea for clearing valleys if he ever did decide to leave the caravan: huge, localized, long-lasting burns. Nat had the chemicals in his red wagon along with a lot of other toys while the fuel is out in the world in the form of things such as buildings and cars. Bailey and Aiden had wanted to go after Michonne which Nat finds to be insane for a multitude of reasons, but they'd had enough. Nat had had enough a long time ago, but he had still stuck around. Nat kept making promises to himself about when he'd go, but he never did, and years went by. 
"It was time to go a long time ago. I knew it. And look at that. You know, a lot of people felt the same way, and suddenly, I had more than just the chemicals in my red wagon."
 Michonne thanks her friends, and Bailey thanks her in turn for waking them up, calling it a big move for himself and Aiden. Nat states that he knows how to build and burn things, but it takes more than that at the end of the world and Michonne showed everyone that, including Nat. Nat promises that they will take Michonne as far as she needs, and Michonne promises her friends that when she gets Rick, they will all come home with her to Alexandria, joking that it's just going to take a little building which Nat knows how to do.

Nat heads off to bed while Bailey goes to get Aiden some food over her objections, stating that she needs to eat. Michonne realizes that her friend is 
pregnant
, and Aiden explains that she had been craving honey and while she was looking for a hive, Bailey saw a billboard for a big-box store and was trying to surprise since honey apparently just never expires. Getting honey for Aiden was why Bailey had been out there, but Aiden found him and Michonne then found them both. Aiden starts crying, and Michonne comforts her, suggesting that Aiden and Bailey should head for Alexandria immediately with some of the others to help them which will take a week or two. However, Aiden tells Michonne that, according to the map, they're close to Bridgers Terminal and she and Bailey want to be there when Michonne finds Rick. They'll go to Alexandria once Rick has been found.

As the group makes their way through a 
deserted town
, Michonne asks Nat about all of the people with them since Nat supposedly only like Aiden, Bailey and Michonne. Nat tells Michonne that they've gone up a letter grade for sure, but quite to Nat liking them. Michonne asks about the other people in Nat's life, and he tells Michonne that it was Nat and his mom as his supreme asshole of a father didn't want a dwarf for a son. Nat also had a lot of bullies, so he started burning things and blowing them up in the woods. Nat's mom, who worked at a truly horrible chicken place 14 hours a day and had one very troubled kid, eventually met a man who called himself 
Danger
. Nat hated Danger as soon as he looked at him, but Danger liked him. After marrying Nat's mom and moving in, Danger suddenly had all of these problems that he needed Nat to solve for him. Nat built all sorts of gadgets to help Danger out and he now realizes that Danger got Nat focused on how he could build things instead of burning them. At Michonne's prompting, Nat acknowledges that he had loved his stepfather.

As the group stops to clear an obstacle, a 
CRM
 helicopter flies overhead and drops 
Chlorine Gas
 bombs on the town. Recognizing the deadly gas, Nat yells orders for everyone to cover their mouths with fabric and to wet it with their canteens. Nat's Group quickly falls victim to the gas, dying and reanimating. Struggling to breathe in the toxic cloud, Michonne dispatches three of the walkers and Nat picks the lock on 
an abandoned mall
. Michonne manages to clear out the walkers on the other side of the door and Michonne, Bailey and Nat - who are the only survivors of the chemical attack - help Aiden, who is the worst off, to a bed in the mall. Barely alive, Aiden weakly tells Michonne to go back to her children and not to take the risk of looking for Rick. With everyone struggling to breathe, Michonne decides to check out a nearby medical plaza in the hopes of finding some oxygen tanks. Knowing that Aiden has a low chance of survival, Michonne orders Bailey to find something to tie his girlfriend to the bed, warning him not to fall asleep next to her.

Michonne returns to the mall with a cart full of oxygen tanks, only to find that Aiden has died and reanimated while she was gone, blood covering her mouth and the pillow next to her. Devastated, Michonne stabs her friend in the head with her sword and finds a zombified Bailey reaching over a burning countertop, several dead walker bodies nearby, Bailey having fallen asleep next to Aiden and then been bitten by her once she turned. Michonne stabs Bailey through the head, but collapses along with his body in her severely weakened state. On the other side of the counter, a crying Nat thanks Michonne as Nat couldn't bring himself to put his friend down like the other walkers that had been drawn in by his fire. 
"She was -- she was right. When you can, you need to go home. It's been too long. He's gone,"
 gasps out Nat. However, Michonne refuses to give up her search for Rick.

Nat weakly explains that they were hit by chlorine gas which he'd read about as a kid and dreamed about dropping it on the football team. The gas burned out their lungs and throats and it will take Michonne and Nat awhile to get better, if they even do. Michonne sets herself and Nat up with oxygen tanks and they spend months at the mall slowly recovering, the leaves turning to snow, and surviving on supplies from the food court. Michonne tries to do pushups, but can't even get started before a coughing fit stops her. Nat reflects that he knew when to go and he didn't, and everyone died. Nat tells Michonne that you've gotta know when to go and when to give up. The leaves turn green outside as it becomes summer and Michonne, still on oxygen but now stronger, reminds Nat that his stepdad didn't give up on him, which Michonne suggests is because of Nat's mom and love. Michonne looks at Rick's phone, stretches her hands, and tries pushups again, this time with more success, although Michonne still struggles. The leaves turn brown as fall hits again, at least a year having passed during Michonne and Nat's recovery and Michonne completes her pushups, although it leaves her somewhat out of breath.

Having now recovered, Michonne and Nat eat together and Michonne gives Nat a map that she's marked the location of Alexandria on, telling Nat that he's strong enough now. However, Nat suggests that he should go to Bridgers Terminal while Michonne goes home, but Michonne doesn't want to risk Nat dying too after they lost Aiden and Bailey. An emotional Nat tells Michonne that she's all that he's got left, and Michonne gives in, agreeing to leave in the morning with him for Bridgers Terminal. Nat wants to stop at his wagon first which is close, and he'll fix the cart so that they can load it with his gear. Michonne asks if Nat coming is about him wanting to see how it ends, but Nat simply tells her that it's not because he already knows how it ends.

Michonne and Nat, accompanied by a 
armless and jawless
 walker pulling the cart full of Nat's tools, finally arrive at Bridgers Terminal. Michonne finds a sign reading 
"SAFE HARBOR"
 on the side of a large beached ship and piles of dozens of burned corpses, the survivors at the terminal having fallen to an unknown enemy group. A horrified Michonne spends well into the night checking the bodies for Rick, comparing the feet to Rick's boots without success.

Sitting by a campfire, a tearful Michonne hugs Rick's boot and Nat brings her a blanket. Nat tells Michonne that this was the last place that the boat where Michonne found Rick's boots was last and the corpses are all too burnt up to tell one from the other, most of them barefoot. Michonne insists that she can still feel Rick and Nat informs her that the Japanese on Rick's phone means 
"believe a little bit longer."
 Nat once again encourages Michonne to go home, but to still believe that Rick's out there. Breaking down, Michonne admits that the truth has been right in front of her this whole time: if Rick was still alive, he would've found his way home by now. Nat tells Michonne that 
"you don't know. Not for sure. You can believe he's out there, that he's not gone. You can believe a little longer and still go home to your kids. You -- you can know when to go. You can do both. I can do it with you. I will. It's not giving up."
 Nat places a radio on the rocks in front of Michonne and she starts sobbing as Michonne finally decides to go home, comforted by Nat.

In the present, Michonne and Nat make their way towards Alexandria and Michonne attempts to raise Judith on the radio without success. Nat tells Michonne that they should start getting close enough in the next few days and suggests finding a place to sleep, but Michonne wants to push on a little further first. Hearing a noise, Nat spots a CRM helicopter approaching through his monocular and orders her to grab the cart from the walker. Putting down her walker pet, Michonne grabs the cart and the two set up a shoulder and tripod mounted launcher for Nat's screamsticks to attack the helicopter, which is flying low, with. The first shot is 
seemingly
 a dud, but Nat's next few shots bring the helicopter down.

As five men emerge from the wreckage, Nat fires another screamstick at them, apparently killing two, and the other three briefly shoot at them before running. Michonne moves in with her sword while Nat takes down the three men with a screamstick, recalling losing her friends to the CRM's gas attack. 
Vengeful
, Michonne removes the first two 
Frontliner
's helmets and slits their throats, making them look her in the eyes as Michonne kills them. Attacking and disarming the third man, Michonne remembers Judith and 
R.J.
 and Nat's advice that she can believe a little longer and still go home to her kids as well as Rick telling Michonne that she can lose him.

Removing the third man's helmet, Michonne is shocked to find that it's Rick. Michonne drops her sword and removes her mask and Rick and Michonne stare at each other in shock, reunited for the first time in years. Rick and Michonne embrace with Michonne crying that she had found him. Rick asks about Judith, and Michonne reassures him that their daughter is alive. Rick tells Michonne that he's not with the CRM, and she states that she knows. Rick and Michonne kiss and bask in being together again at long last. Hearing a noise in the distance, Rick tells Michonne that more of the CRM are coming and it's too late to go. Rick instructs Michonne to give the CRM another name and to say that she came out of the forest and saw the soldiers being attacked, that she was a part of a small community that had fallen years ago, 
"don't show them who you are. Strong. A leader. You hide it."
 Michonne is shocked and confused by Rick's orders, but Rick insists that they must go back with the CRM, promising Michonne that he will make it so that they get away, and Michonne reluctantly agrees.

Watching the reunion, a shocked Nat realizes that Rick is who they've been looking for this whole time, and Michonne promises her friend that Rick isn't with the CRM. Nat is suddenly shot from behind by a Frontliner who was only badly wounded by his screamstick. As Michonne rushes to tend to her friend, Rick grabs Michonne's sword and uses it to finish the soldier off. Dying, Nat asks if she can tell if it's still Rick and Michonne reassures Nat that she can tell that it's still him. With his last words, Nat tells Michonne 
"see? You can still believe and know when --"
 Michonne cries over Nat's body, confirming to Rick that Nat had helped her to get here. Rick offers Michonne his condolences, but knowing that they're low on time, asks if she has anything on her that can tell the CRM about her or Alexandria. Michonne tells Rick that she has a journal, a radio, a phone and his boots, and Rick asks for them, placing Michonne's sword in Nat's hand.

At the cart, Rick retrieves the incriminating belongings while Michonne loads her sheath onto it. Rick instructs Michonne to tell the CRM that Nat had the sword and Michonne took one of the soldier's guns off of the ground and stopped him. They're going to be separated, but Rick promises to find Michonne as soon as it's safe. As more helicopters approach, Rick tells Michonne that he needs to have his gun on her, and the CRM will need to see that Michonne has her hands up. In addition, Michonne needs to call the undead something other than walkers as that's the name that Rick calls them. Rick swears that they will get away, and he loves her. As three CRM helicopters arrive, Michonne raises her hands and smiles as one descends in front of the pair.

At the CRM base, Michonne speaks with a group of CRM officers, telling them a cover story incorporating a number of aspects of the truth, taking inspiration from the people that she has encountered along the way and her own experiences. Michonne claims that her name is Dana, she's been on her own for so long that it's strange to hear her own voice, and before that she was in 
Georgia
 for a long time with her boyfriend, about 40 other people and some leaders that she thought were good, including her sister Elle. However, things changed, the people that she was with changed and Michonne knew that they should go because you always really know when to go. Michonne claims that her weapon of choice was a bo 
staff
 - like 
Morgan Jones
, 
Henry Sutton
, and 
Lydia
 - but that she had lost it months ago and has been making do with just a knife ever since. Looking at a one-way mirror which she's being observed from behind, Michonne tells the officers that she isn't bothered by the observation, she just hasn't seen herself in awhile. One of the officers tells Michonne that this is a place of law and that they are in a base on the outskirts of a city that is a remnant of the life that they knew. As its security is their top priority, Michonne can never leave, but she truthfully tells the officers that she feels that what's here is what she's been looking for and what Michonne's been trying to believe in just a little while longer.

Having been accepted into the consignment program, Michonne wanders through the base and is discreetly pulled into a garage by Rick where they kiss. Rick reassures his wife that the CRM had believed her since Michonne is here and Michonne notices Rick's prosthetic hand. Rick explains that it had happened a long time ago during one of Rick's last attempts to get home. Michonne is confused by this, but Rick simply tells her that the CRM had him trapped, but they don't have him anymore and Rick and Michonne will get away together. Michonne confirms that Judith's okay, but she decides against telling Rick about his son R.J. - whom Rick doesn't know exists yet - until after they get away. Accepting this, Rick orders Michonne to destroy any notes that he manages to somehow pass her. Michonne tells Rick that the CRM killed dozens of people and are killing other survivors out there, but Rick reassures her that he hasn't had to take part in that. Rick knows that the ones in red go out sometimes and return covered in blood and most of the CRM don't know what they did, including Rick. Michonne wants to try to stop the CRM, but Rick denies it as they'll never make it back if they do. Rick gives Michonne Nat's lighter, and she tells Rick that Nat and everyone else should've lived, but they're here together now and they're going to get home. After sharing a final kiss, Rick and Michonne leave. Someone watches the tape of Michonne's interrogation, enters Rick's apartment and pours themselves a drink as Michonne climbs up on top of a container and looks out over the CRM base, fidgeting with Nat's lighter, which has his stepfather's nickname labeled on it, "Danger".



"
Bye
"


In a voiceover, Michonne narrates a message to 
Judith
, telling her daughter that she's found Rick in a place that she didn't expect, a world that she didn't expect. Michonne knows that Judith has questions and Michonne wishes that she could answer them, but there is a lot that Michonne doesn't know yet about the people here and how they were able to keep someone as strong as Rick for so long. Rick has been trying to come home all of this time, only to be stopped again and again by the CRM. However, they can't stop Rick and Michonne together.

At the 
culling facility
, consignees bang their 
Kill Sticks
 on the wall, including Michonne, as a truck leads a 
herd
 of walkers to them. As the walkers approach, Michonne looks at a nearby sign reading 
"GRIMES 68"
, presumably a record that Rick had set while killing walkers as a consignee at the facility. When the walkers get close enough, Michonne and the other consignees begin dispatching them with their kill sticks.

In the aftermath, Michonne and 
Cleo Clifton
 load corpses onto carts while an announcer congratulates the consignees and states that they are two hours to transport to Richmond Power Station. Cleo notes that Michonne had cut through the walkers quickly, and asks if she's been out there for awhile. Michonne confirms it and introduces herself as "Dana Bethune," claiming that she's just taking it all in. Cleo, who was also out in the world for awhile, is excited to be on the doorstep of paradise. Although Michonne is dubious that it's paradise for everyone, Cleo thinks that it is, noting that she was eating crickets and living in a tree when the CRM found her. Hearing distant explosions, Cleo explains that it's 
Disruption Charges
 to scatter the walkers if too many build up in one area and it's the second time this week, but Michonne is visibly suspicious given her own 
experiences
 with the organization. Cleo asks if Michonne is on a three-day or a six-day training, explaining that it depends on how much steel the CRM thinks the consignees have after sizing them up. Cleo guesses that Michonne is on a three-day training, admitting that she's just glad to be with someone new who knows what they're doing.

As Cleo moves bodies from a pile, two of the walkers turn out to be non-kills. Although the CRM soldiers guarding them orders the consignees to get down so that they can shoot the walkers, Michonne impales one through the head with her kill stick, 
decapitates
 it, and throws the head into a walker that's sneaking up on Cleo from behind, smashing the second walker's head and saving her new friend's life. The soldiers and Cleo are impressed, and the soldiers move in to check for any more walkers that haven't been completely put down. The consignees are ordered to clear out for station assessment while Michonne and Cleo are ordered to return to transport for a health check and incident report. Michonne passes by Rick, who walks up on the aftermath of the incident, without a word. Concerned, Rick notices Thorne talking to one of the soldiers who had been overseeing the consignees.


Alone, Rick pulls out his old consignee uniform and gear, a pair of paddles and pours over some maps, tracing a route along the coast. Hearing explosions in the distance, Rick takes notes about preemptive charges to the north/northeast at 21:00 and takes a drink.

The next day, as Michonne finishes eating, Rick discreetly passes her a note. In a subway tunnel, Rick finds a skeleton pinned under a beam with a bag full of food cans and a message carved into the floor next to it reading 
"TELL THEM I'M SORRY I LIED."
 Hearing walkers nearby, Rick draws a large coil of wire. At 20:17, Rick reaches the Spring Garden turnstiles which has a number of walkers on the other side. Rick reaches the riverbank where he finds a couple of half-submerged walkers and awaits Michonne's arrival.

In the note, Rick tells Michonne that tonight is their chance to make an escape and the disruption charges brought out more of the dead with the next night's bringing out even more. Following Rick's directions, Michonne goes to locker 678 in Consignee Fitness after post-task health check where she finds a key that will get her out of the base and away, a flashlight and a hand drawn map detailing a way out. Michonne is instructed to find a red canoe hidden in the brush and discovers that Rick also left Michonne's 
katana
 for her. Moving through the tunnels, Michonne dispatches a lone walker with her sword, and discovers the rest of the herd held back by wire that Rick had earlier strung across the tunnel. At 21:00, the disruption charges go off in the distance and Michonne reaches the Spring Garden turnstile where she witnesses the walkers forcing themselves through, cutting to pieces a walker that was trapped in the turnstiles.

Michonne reaches the riverbank and finds the canoe, but no sign of Rick aside from one of the walkers in the river being dressed in Rick's old consignee jacket. In the canoe, Michonne finds another letter in Rick's bag where Rick reveals that he's not coming with her, but if Michonne doesn't go, she will never escape, and they will both die here. Rick needs to stay at the Civic Republic to make sure that Michonne gets away, believing that it's the only way to get his wife back to Judith. Rick tells Michonne that he loves her forever and if she loves him, Michonne will go. Michonne is devastated by Rick's sacrifice to ensure that she can escape.


Responding to a page, Rick joins Thorne at the culling facility where she tells Rick that he's in real trouble now. Michonne is amongst the consignees putting down walkers, doing so with a fury that surprises and impresses Cleo and the other consignees. Thorne recalls that Michonne had said during intake that she was looking for safety in numbers which had helped Thorne to make her case. However, Michonne doesn't look like someone who relies on others for safety. Michonne exchanges a look with Rick before wordlessly walking away and Rick looks the sign with his score on it.

Rick discreetly pulls Michonne aside, telling her that the only way he wasn't killed for all of these years was one man saving his life over and over again. The only way that Michonne gets away is if someone is here making sure and it's taken Rick years to know that he can't go anymore. Rick asked for help, and he didn't get it. The only way to escape is for help from someone on the inside which Rick is for Michonne. Rick reminds Michonne that he said that if she loved him, she'd go, but Michonne just sadly walks away without a word.

In a voiceover, Michonne narrates another message to Judith, recalling 
Nat
's advice that she had to know when to go. While Michonne had a chance to go home, she couldn't without Rick, but now Michonne wonders if she should've. Just when Michonne had wondered if Rick could've been drawn in by the ambition and the hope of this place, that it could've replaced Rick's family, she found something.

Michonne and the other consignees are taken on a tour of the Civic Republic, visiting Millenium Park just like Rick did on his own tour. At Benjiro's Portraiture and Art stand, on an old television screen, a portrait of a woman and a boy is carved, similar to the carvings on Rick's iPhones. Some of the other televisions at the stand hold portraits as well while 
Benjiro
 is working on carving into another iPhone. Michonne realizes that Benjiro is the one who drew her and Judith which he confirms, recognizing her. Benjiro explains that Rick would come every few months and ask for a new one, but while there was a boy that Rick would ask him to draw, Benjiro could never get it right for Rick. Michonne tearfully tells Benjiro that the boy is 
Carl
, and Benjiro notes that Michonne is more open since it took Rick 3 years to say any names. Identifying Michonne and Judith by name, Benjiro asks if Judith is here too, but Michonne reassures Benjiro that Judith is okay even though she's not there with them. Benjiro explains that Rick had wanted the drawings for until he saw Michonne again, and here she is. Rick always knew that he'd see Michonne again and when he started giving up hope, Benjiro told Rick to believe a little bit longer. Michonne thanks Benjiro for how much he had helped her with his drawings, telling the young man that now that Rick's found her, Michonne is looking for him. Benjiro encourages Michonne to believe a little bit longer.

Overseeing the consignees alongside Rick, Thorne pulls Michonne aside and introduces herself, asking how Michonne had enjoyed orientation and her first trip into the city. Michonne pointedly states that she saw some interesting artwork, and Thorne notes her lack of enthusiasm, asking if that life isn't for her, but Michonne just asks if she has another choice. Thorne has Michonne leave with herself and Rick.

Thorne takes Rick and Michonne to Okafor's secret meeting spot in the ruins of 
Lincoln Financial Field
, explaining to Michonne that it's what the city would've become if it wasn't for the actions of one man who bombed the stadium instead. Thorne tells Michonne that she doesn't know much about her, but Michonne emerged from the woods and saved the life of someone very important, someone who had saved Thorne's life once. Thorne would call Rick her friend, but friendship doesn't seem like something that exists out here as it's too light and soft. Rick is Thorne's family now, her only family, so Thorne's question is who Michonne is. Michonne claims to be just Dana and just a survivor, but Thorne knows that she's lying as a survivor wouldn't have run out of the woods to save a man who was about to have his throat cut. Michonne states that she did, and she survived, and Michonne did it because she was looking for people since it's safer with people. It didn't feel right to leave Rick to die while he was lying on the ground helpless, but Thorne is amused by this as she can't imagine Rick ever being helpless. Michonne continues to insist that she doesn't know Rick and he would've died if Michonne hadn't been there to help him. Michonne doesn't want to see anyone get killed, especially anyone who seems helpless.

"I'm letting you in on a secret. You are here because of me. People like you, they're not let in. You're a leader, what we call an "A". If you are allowed to live in the city, you won't work, farm, shop, read. No. You'll look for answers. You'll ask what happened here and why and to whom, and you'll seek justice based on a feeling in your gut, a feeling you can't name,"
 says Thorne, drawing a knife behind her back. Seeing this, Rick draws his gun, but Thorne tells Michonne that there is only one way to get those answers, those secrets and to understand the whole picture, asking if she would take that chance. Thorne confirms that Michonne could get the answers that very few get in the entirety of the entire force and in the entirety of the world. Michonne confirms that her answer would be yes, and Thorne puts her knife away. Thorne tells Rick that Michonne will be joining them for clearing operations at Cascadia Base, ordering him to ensure that Michonne is properly equipped with a provisional BDU, but she will only be allowed to use a kill stick as her weapon.

Thorne sends Michonne away, and Rick compliments her work on recruiting Michonne to their cause. However, Thorne is conflicted, telling Rick that Michonne is strong and Thorne's not Okafor. They don't mess with security and for all Thorne knows, Michonne could be sprinting towards the river. Thorne points out that Rick drew his sidearm, but Rick just claims that it was to back her up after Rick saw Thorne draw her knife and he's sure that Michonne isn't trying to escape. Thorne won't be responsible for a vulnerability, Thorne knows it all now, she sees why they're out here doing this and she's not Okafor.

Flying to the Cascadia Forward Operating Base, Thorne explains to Michonne that it used to be a university before the CRM turned it into a center of power with the only infantry who have seen it aside from the Frontliners being Rick and Thorne. Thorne jokes that if Michonne does well, she'll have salmon for dinner which will be worth the cross-country trip even if it means stopping at five different jump points for fuel. Michonne observes that there's nothing out here and questions what the base is protecting, and Thorne states that it's protecting the security of the Civic Republic, expanded resources and intel operations along the West Coast and the future.

At the base, they arrive to news of an imminent walker threat. Thorne holds a briefing for Rick, Michonne and four Frontliners - the only available troops with the base's squads out on operations - revealing that they have a significant sink breach on the perimeter bars with scatters already incurring. Thorne calls this the obstacle while the objective is 200 plus incoming walkers moving towards the breach. Flybys and disruption charges are only bouncing off of the rock face, rendering them ineffective, so they're going to wipe the herd out themselves. The base is only a few days away from the summit of all CRM brass and the entire Frontliner corps and if the herd piles through that breach, the project goes back to zero which everyone refuses to allow to happen. One soldier will take the R-DIM through the breach beyond the horde to place it 100 paces past the horde's exit edge and a flyby will then shoot charges to create a dispersional sound. Thorne intends to take the R-DIM herself, ordering the soldiers to use cold weapons and pneumatic rifles only as it's a stealth mission. Michonne is ordered to stay off the line on clean up to take care of any walkers that survive. If things go bad, Michonne is to get herself lost in the fog and hit her PRB so that any CRM helicopter within 300 miles can come find her. Privately, Thorne jokes to Rick that she's taking the R-DIM because everyone else is too slow. After having the Echelon Briefing and learning everything, Thorne doesn't agree with Okafor on everything, but he led from the ground up which Thorne wants to do too.

At the breach, Rick and the Frontliners use pneumatic rifles to dispatch incoming walkers as Thorne struggles with the R-DIM, rejecting Michonne's attempts to help her. Unable to free the R-DIM and with all of the base's soldiers otherwise occupied, Thorne joins Rick and the Frontliners in combating the herd, deciding that they'll wait for a gap to bring the R-DIM up. Ignoring Thorne's orders, Michonne frees the R-DIM and charges through the herd with it, eventually joined by Rick. Together, they push it past the herd and Rick activates the device, starting a siren that draws most of the walkers in. Rick and Michonne take cover as the R=DIM is bombed, destroying most of the herd. Rick and Michonne kiss and she urges him to escape with her, but Rick refuses, knowing that the CRM will find them. Rick and Michonne return to where Thorne and the Frontliners are dispatching the remaining walkers. Thorne takes aim at Michonne, preparing to kill her, but Rick notices this and jumps in between the two with a walker, telling Thorne that there's only 10 walkers left. Frustrated and angry, Thorne stands down and joins Rick, Michonne and the Frontliners in finishing off the last of the herd.

At night, as Michonne loads up a jeep, Jadis joins Rick, telling him that she's headquartered here now, through the summit and beyond. Jadis suggests that Rick should come take a look at her quarters which have a beautiful view of the Cascades. Jadis notes that Michonne hasn't seen her yet just before Michonne spots Jadis. 
"Oh. There it is. She saw me,"
 Jadis quips. Michonne is shocked to see Jadis again, but Rick tells his wife that it doesn't matter and Michonne is going back to base right now and getting out of here if Rick has to knock her out and put Michonne on the boat himself. Rick belongs here and Michonne doesn't and Michonne will never change that. 
"It's over. Everything we had is broken,"
 Rick claims.

In the middle of a 
thunderstorm
, Rick and Michonne ride in a helicopter back to the base in the Civic Republic. Michonne looks out the window at a river below before suddenly unbuckling herself, opening the door, and yanking Rick out of the helicopter with her. In a voiceover, Michonne apologizes to Judith, saying she doesn't know if they'll be back.



"
What We
"


In an empty lavish apartment, loud music plays while a Roomba cleans the floor. Outside of the window, the 
CRM
 helicopter carrying 
Rick
 and Michonne flies through 
a severe thunderstorm
. Michonne suddenly grabs Rick and drags him out of the helicopter in mid-air dropping them both into a river. Pulling themselves ashore, Rick and Michonne run into the building and into the apartment which they are shocked to find still has power and an automated voice welcoming them home, presuming Rick and Michonne to be the residents.

Michonne explains that they needed a time out and Rick is shocked by her actions while Michonne is shocked by what Rick had said to her. Wondering what this place is, Rick and Michonne explore the apartment which has power, running water, working toilets, and an empty fridge. Michonne changes out of her consignee uniform and into some of the clothes in the closet while Rick watches his wife with interest, 
noticing an X scar on her lower back
. Rick looks at Michonne's PRB, having lost his own in the fall, and Michonne, 
well aware
 of what the CRM does, asks if Rick really wants to call them here, putting the device into her pocket.

Finding a copy of 
Ramona the Pest
 on the bookshelf, Michonne reminisces about how she had loved the book growing up, comparing Ramona to 
Judith
. Michonne had loved the book so much that she had thought that she was going to be a writer for awhile there and she takes the book to give to Judith. Michonne recalls how she had also thought that she was a computer scientist once, then an art history major, and creative writing again, before she dropped out. Michonne angrily tells Rick that he's become a bit of a writer too these days, calling his note in the getaway boat poetry. Michonne challenges Rick to write another masterpiece for his children, unwilling to be the one to tell them that she had found their father who had sent Michonne away and chose not to come home to them. Rick is shocked, having picked up on Michonne referring to them having children, plural, while Rick had only known of Judith's existence. Michonne reveals that 
"his name is 
Rick
. We call him R.J. I was 
pregnant
 when the 
bridge
 
happened
. He's -- He's almost 8".


Rick tells his wife that she needs to give him the PRB, angering Michonne that that was his reaction to finding out that Rick has a son. Rick insists that he's just trying to keep his family alive, but Michonne is too furious to hear him out, pointing out that Rick had told her that everything that they have is broken after telling her that they were going to get away. His voice breaking, Rick asks if Michonne thinks that he doesn't want to be with her, he tried everything, but they need to go back. Rick chastises Michonne as he had warned her not to show the CRM who she really is, only to have Michonne break the kill record at the 
Harvest Point
, grab the R-DIM from 
Thorne
, nearly get herself killed in the process, and then pull them out of a helicopter while Rick's trying to get them out alive. Michonne states that it's because she doesn't like who Rick is with the CRM: who they make him into isn't Rick. Rick asks if Michonne really thinks that he wants this, and requests the PRB again.

Michonne asks if they're going to just let the CRM win, but Rick sadly tells her 
"look at me. They won a long time ago. They won the day 
Jadis
 brought me here."
 Michonne is shocked to learn that Jadis had brought Rick to the CRM, and realizes that Jadis was working for the CRM. Rick clarifies that Jadis was working with them and, while running away from 
Alexandria
, found Rick half dead at the riverbank. Jadis will destroy their home if Rick tries to leave, but he managed to get Jadis to agree to let Michonne go. Rick wants his wife to live, explaining that Jadis is threatened by them because she believes that Rick and Michonne together can do anything. Michonne insists that they can stop Jadis together, but Rick is worried that the same thing that happened to Michonne's 
friends
 will happen to everyone that they know, particularly their children.

Michonne suggests that they can get to Alexandria first, but Rick is doubtful that they could hide everyone they know, even if they get there in time before Jadis. Killing Jadis won't work either because Jadis left evidence of who they are and where they're from behind that will be found if she's killed so they'll still be found anyways. Rick again asks for the PRB, and Michonne demands to know why all the bullshit, and Rick insists that he had to get her out, that both of them couldn't go home, pointing out that Michonne wouldn't have gone if he had told the truth. Michonne suggests that they go back, find and destroy Jadis' evidence, before killing her and going home. Michonne asks if Rick thinks that they can do anything, because she believes that they can. Seeing Rick's continuing reluctance, Michonne asks what they did to him, but Rick just reiterates that they have to go back, not answering when Michonne asks what they'll do after that. Rick reassures Michonne that he has never stopped loving her, and she hands over the PRB. As the storm clears up outside and the sun rises, Rick and Michonne notice a burning helicopter crashed into the side of the building nearby. Rick realizes that it's their helicopter, crashed by the storm, and Michonne had saved their lives with her daring escape. Michonne realizes that Jadis and the CRM will believe that they had died in the crash, and that they can go home, but Rick still refuses to go home.

Sadly looking out the window, Michonne tells Rick that his son - the one who Rick hasn't asked about - calls his father 
"The Brave Man"
, and R.J. and Judith tell each other the story about what Rick did. As a result, R.J. had started calling himself 
"Little Brave Man"
, something that Michonne loves. Michonne recalls 
Nat
 
telling her
 
"I know how it ends"
 when Michonne had insisted upon continuing her search for Rick. Nat still had Michonne's back even though he knew how her search would end and while Michonne was so sure that Nat was wrong, he wasn't: Michonne found Rick, but she didn't. This is not how Michonne had imagined things going at all, incredulously pointing out that they just got a way out, and yet Rick wants to stay with an army that has kept him against his will for years. Rick insists that he has to ensure that Michonne is protected and to keep the CRM from coming for their home. Rick admits that he doesn't know for sure that the CRM is coming for Alexandria, but they could one day. Rick has been looking the other way on their atrocities such as killing innocent people, reminding Michonne that she had wanted to stop the CRM too. If Rick stays, he can make sure that Judith and R.J. are protected from them, but Michonne calls her husband out on his bullshit.

Rick explains that the first man that Michonne and Nat had killed was 
Okafor
, the man who had saved Rick's life and wanted him to become a part of the CRM to move up and help Okafor change it. Rick didn't have anything left, so he gave himself over to Okafor's mission. Michonne points out that it's Okafor's mission, not Rick's, and asks if he remembers the life that they had together, telling Rick that what they were building has kept people alive. Michonne saw Rick standing behind Thorne, a soldier at attention for this army, and she thought 
"he's a prisoner here and we have to break out. You don't choose to stay in prison. When the doors open, you leave".
 However, Rick states that they've been crawling around in the dirt for a long time, losing people that they love, and this felt like a chance or a way to stop that, not to surrender to it, but to fight for everyone. Michonne insists that the 
Civic Republic
 isn't his responsibility and Rick has a family, but Rick feels that it is his responsibility. Okafor's gone and Thorne has gone over to the CRM completely, meaning that Rick is the only one left to carry out Okafor's plan.

Michonne points out that there's a lot of maybes in Rick's argument: Rick is trying to keep them safe by maybe changing the CRM one day, who might come after their home and put it in danger. Michonne asks if Rick really won't come home to his wife and kids, but Rick continues to insist that this is something that he has to do, not something that he wants to do so he won't go with her. Michonne recognizes that Rick is lying, but she declares that it doesn't matter: Michonne is going back to her kids whom she had left to find Rick. Michonne furiously grabs her belongings, a kitchen knife, and breaks off a wooden lamp leg to use as a makeshift 
spear
. 
"Well, I found you. I fought for you. I tried to reason with you. I pleaded with you, and now, I have to go. You're lying, and you'll see it, and it'll be too late".
 Michonne furiously leaves, but devastated, stops down the hall to compose herself while Rick does the same in the apartment. After a moment of waiting for Rick, Michonne begins to leave and starts down the stairs. Rick follows her, not noticing the CRM helicopter approaching in the distance.

In the lobby, Michonne finds a large 
herd
 wandering around outside and readies her makeshift weapons as Rick runs to join his wife. Outside, the second CRM helicopter fires missiles into the crashed helicopter, destroying it and destabilizing the building. Rick pulls Michonne out of the way of falling debris that shatters the glass windows in the lobby, letting the herd in. Rick and Michonne quickly flee back inside, leaving Michonne's weapons on the floor. Rick and Michonne desperately try to find a way out as walkers storm the crumbling building. Michonne wants to find a place to hunker down until the number of dead thins out, but Rick tells her that they'll only get trapped if they do that and they can't breach from this high up, even if it's a defensible position. Sarcastically referring to Rick as Commando, Michonne points out that she doesn't even have a weapon and asks how they're supposed to fight past all of those walkers. Michonne finds more walkers in a science lab as cracks form in the concrete walls and she leads Rick into an unlocked gym.

Rick ties the doors closed, explaining that the CRM will destroy any evidence that they exist, hence destroying the crashed helicopter. The whole building is buckling, but Michonne finds a 
suicide
 note next to a corpse wearing a headset hooked up to a fuse box with a controller in its hand. The note reads 
"it's just time. When I conceived of 
Greenwood
 it was so clear -- like-minded innovators in various fields seeking to live off the grid, to create a new, more sustained, and hopeful tomorrow. Our motto -- Progress and Redemption Through Innovation -- is now like a sick joke to me, but I can't face how much I have failed everyone. I cannot go another day continuing to watch our mission die. I am sorry. Let me be remembered as one who refused to leave the world the same way I found it. 
Lakshmi Patel
".
 Rick sees that the notices on the bulletin board reads things such as 
"Trust in Your Ability to Adapt and Overcome. Your Past Doesn't Define You"
, 
"Recover Regenerate"
 and 
"Keep Hope Alive!"


Michonne notes that when people try to save the world their own way, it tends to go to shit. Michonne compares the CRM to Greenwood, telling Rick that Greenwood thought that they knew it all too, although they didn't kill innocent people like the CRM. Rick tells Michonne that the Civic Republic still stands, promising to find a way to stop the killing, but Michonne just compares Rick to Lakshmi. Michonne is incredulous that Rick is willing to sign up for lifelong duty to the enemy, but Rick states that this is about ending the enemy. Although Michonne believes that this isn't Rick, Rick asks her how Rick's willingness to give up his hand and his life for her isn't Rick. Rick believes that this is what he needs to do to keep Michonne safe, but Michonne tells her husband that the only time that she feels safe is when she's with Rick. Michonne insists that they don't have to be afraid, but Rick believes that they do. Michonne asks if she should tell R.J. that his father didn't want to know anything about him because he was so afraid, but Rick states that he's not The Brave Man and Michonne shouldn't have come. Rick was taken away and he didn't have a choice, but Michonne did. Furious and in tears, Michonne accuses Rick of not knowing anything anymore, and asks if this is who Rick is now: a soldier of the CRM, someone who is moving up and possibly someone that Michonne should be afraid of now. Michonne doesn't know what Rick's capable of anymore, he's lied to her and continues to lie to her. Michonne furiously demands to know if Rick doesn't think that she's not beating herself up for not being with her kids anymore, that Michonne isn't wondering how she'll ever live with herself if something ever happens to herself, but Rick insists that that's why she should go. Calming down, Michonne declares that she doesn't know who Rick is because the Rick that she knew would never talk to her like that.

As the building continues to buckle, Rick declares that they're getting out of here and breaks off a weight bench seat to use as a shield against the walkers while Michonne grabs a bar to use as a weapon. Together, Rick and Michonne force their way out of the gym and battle the zombified Greenwood residents as a seamless team, even inadvertently getting a shared kill at one point that results in Michonne getting splashed in the face with walker blood, much to her annoyance.

In the stairwell, the chandelier breaks loose of the celling and falls on Michonne, trapping her legs underneath. Rick and Michonne attempt to move the chandelier, noticing walkers approaching from the other side of some fallen rubble blocking the door to the next floor. Michonne urges Rick to go, but he just orders her to grab her makeshift spear and handle the walkers while Rick deals with the bolts holding the chandelier together. As Rick works, Michonne dispatches a walker, but her spear gets trapped in the body of a walker behind it which is able to force its way down to her. Rick gives Michonne his knife to stab the walker with and she manages to free her spear as more walkers make their way up the stairs from below and from behind the fallen rubble. Rick again refuses to leave Michonne, telling her that that's never happening, something that she had needed to hear. Dispatching any walkers that get too close, Rick and Michonne finally manage to free her and Rick promises that she never has to thank him.

Rick and Michonne reach the 7th floor, dispatching a couple of more walkers in their way, and take cover in the apartment which is on the side of the building that hasn't started buckling yet. After a moment's hesitation, the couple kisses and makes love on the bed.

Laying together, Rick asks Michonne about R.J., and Michonne tells Rick that it's nuts how much his son looks like him. Aside from the light brown skin and having Michonne's eyes, it's hard to tell that she had anything to do with making R.J. Their son is stubborn like both of his parents, and he has Rick's good, kind heart which is the part of R.J. that reminds Michonne the most of Rick. As the couple kisses, a Roomba cleaning the floor startles Rick, much to Michonne's amusement. Having just gotten one before the world ended, Michonne explains that it cleans the floor on a timer, thus explaining why the apartment is so spotless. Rick notes that the city's intact with no burned out buildings, fallen walls or bullet holes, just walkers who are all rail thin and Michonne guesses that the residents of Greenwood had run out of food and died of starvation. Rick points out that they had kept this place running a good while, but Michonne states that they did more than that: they kept innovating. The people of Greenwood were probably sick of scavenging and wanted to create another way. Michonne is confused that they apparently didn't have crops, but Rick points out that even if they did have them, crops fail which could've contributed to Greenwood's demise. 
"One bad harvest -- Something has to burn to bring it back,"
 says Rick, recalling what 
his father
 did when Rick was a child, much to Michonne's confusion. Rick believes that if he can change the CRM, there will be a real chance for future generations, but Michonne tells Rick that he's still lying to her and more importantly, Rick's lying to himself.

As Michonne sits up and starts getting dressed, Rick asks about the X on her back. Michonne explains that it was an old college 
friend
 of hers that Michonne had 
let into Alexandria
. Michonne was searching for Rick every day with 
Daryl
 and, with no body and no trace of Rick, Michonne couldn't stop believing that he was still out there needing help, needing her. Everyone thought that Michonne was crazy, but her friend Jocelyn encouraged her to keep looking. Michonne was seven months pregnant with R.J. and Jocelyn, who was sick and twisted, stole Judith and some other kids and branded Michonne and Daryl. Michonne and Daryl stopped Jocelyn, but Michonne doesn't want to go into how, not wanting to reveal how she was forced to kill all of the kids in 
Jocelyn's Group
 aside from 
Winnie
. After Michonne confirms that she had killed Jocelyn, Rick is pleased. Following that incident, Michonne stopped looking for Rick because she had to take care of the baby and Judith, but she kept believing that Rick was not gone forever, something that she still believes. As Rick gets dressed, Michonne asks if he cut off his hand to get away and he was trying to come home, both of which Rick confirms. 
"You're still trying. I see it. Even through the bullshit. You have the button. You could've hit it, Rick. You haven't. You say you can't go home, but... I don't think you can go back".
 Her voice breaking and touching her husband's stump, Michonne tells Rick that she's sorry for what the CRM did to him.

The apartment shakes as their part of the building starts to destabilize and Rick insists that they have to go as they're running out of time. However, Michonne refuses, telling Rick that they need to decide what's next right now. Even though the building is collapsing, Michonne refuses to leave until they've decided. 
"Nat used to say "you gotta know when to go". It's not time to go. Not until we know where we're going".
 Reluctantly sitting on the bed, Rick lays the PRB between himself and Michonne and she asks why Rick had come after her when Michonne had left earlier. On Michonne's prompting, Rick admits that Michonne is the love of his life, and he couldn't just let her go. It felt like Rick's heart ripped itself out of his chest and walked out of the door when Michonne had left. Michonne urges Rick to come home with her, but Rick insists that it's not that easy. Michonne reveals that when the CRM attacked her friends, she got hit with the 
Chlorine Gas
 too. Michonne nearly died and she was holed up in 
a mall
 for a year with Nat trying to recover. The CRM took a year from her, from Michonne's time with her kids. Michonne admits that she had lied to Rick, and she doesn't know how Judith is or if she's okay because Judith had stopped answering the walkie. With how much the CRM has taken from them, Michonne wants to know why Rick is going to give them any more. The hope that Rick has in the CRM, sacrificing himself, is not real while Rick's family is real. Their love for each other doesn't get denied no matter what Rick keeps trying to tell Michonne or himself. This back and forth is hurting Michonne and making her become someone that she doesn't recognize. Rick is hurting her and Michonne knows Rick well enough to know that that is not how he loves. As Rick breaks down, Michonne asks what the CRM did to him, wanting to know what is really going on here.

Rick tearfully explains that the CRM took 
Carl
 and Rick lost his son again. 
"When I got taken, I fought, and I fought, and I just -- I tried to get away, by -- by -- by how I would dream. I'd meet up with Carl in my dreams. And that's how I survived in here. Kept me alive. And then one day he was just gone. He just left. But then I started dreaming of you. And there you were. You and I fell in love in different ways, and it kept me going. And then you were gone, too. And, I couldn't see your face anymore, just like I couldn't see Carl's. I can't live without you. Without you, I die."
 Rick admits that he's figured out how to do that, how to be dead and live now. Rick is terrified that if Michonne comes back into his life and he learns how to live again, Rick will lose her again and he won't figure out how to die all over again, the loss of Michonne will be something that Rick won't be able to survive this time. Rick had needed to get ahead of his fears by making her leave before Michonne could help him to live again. Sobbing, Rick explains that if he could just think that Michonne lives on longer than him without Rick knowing for sure, Rick can at least believe that she's still out there somewhere, living her life. If Michonne actually dies and Rick sees it, he won't be able to survive it. As Rick explains, Rick is shown walking with a young Carl at 
Ross' Farm
 before Carl vanishes, as well as 
his dreams of meeting Michonne in the park
.

Michonne gives Rick a newly engraved iPhone that she had 
Benjiro
 make for him, this one with a portrait of Carl, the one person who Benjiro had been unable to get right for Rick. Rick remembers Carl as a young boy and at Alexandria before his death, finally able to remember his son's face thanks to Michonne's gift. Michonne asks what Carl would say if he was here with them right now and what Carl would want his father to do with this new chance to be with the ones that he loves. Despite all of the odds and all of the years, Michonne found Rick and she came here through all of the hell that they've both been through to take him home. All of that isn't for nothing and it isn't for them to just go their separate ways. 
"We go home, Rick, and we figure out how to protect it together. That's how we make it all make sense. We love on each other, as hard as we can, while we can."
 Rick kisses his wife, finally agreeing to go home with her.

The next morning, as the building begins to go into complete collapse, Rick and Michonne prepare to make their escape while the PA system announces that the elevator only has 10 minutes left of reserve power. Together, the couple fights their way through all of the zombified Greenwood residents in the hall and enter the elevator, sharing a passionate kiss as it takes them to the lobby. Rick and Michonne fight their way outside through the herd still streaming into the building and run across the street to a line of electric vehicles hooked up to their charging ports. In the collapsing apartment lies the PRB, smashed by Rick and Michonne before their departure.

Climbing into and disconnecting a truck from its charging port, Rick discovers that it's a stick shift, much to his annoyance as Rick can't drive a stick shift with his left hand gone and replaced by a prosthetic. Rick and Michonne switch spots, sharing another passionate kiss in the process, before Rick notices that the car has tanks of ethanol in the backseat despite being an electric car. Michonne realizes that the car is a hybrid, running on both electric power and ethanol. The Greenwood car has enough fuel to get them home which Michonne notes that they have to thank those people for who clearly thought that they could do anything. Rick agrees, optimistically quoting 
"we can make this whole damn world ours if we want to."
 A pleased Michonne agrees, noting that it sounds like something that she would say. Rick reveals that he was quoting her, and they drive away as walkers close in on them. The building collapses completely as Rick and Michonne drive away, smiling at each other, heading home to Alexandria together.

Michonne will appear in this episode.



"
The Last Time
"


Rick
 and Michonne make love while a nearby table is full of lit candles, ramen wrappers, empty soda cans, liquor bottles food dishes and a hand drawn map of 
Cascadia Forward Operating Base
. Near the couple lies Rick and 
Jadis
' uniforms on a table with a sewing kit and a small pile of sand, suggesting that they had buried Jadis. On the floor lies Rick's bag, Jadis' 
rifle
, the couple's 
machete
, 
spear
 and 
hatchet
, as well as 
Danger
's lighter, the iPhone engraved with 
Carl
's portrait and their wedding ring. 

In a series of voiceovers, Rick says that he remembers it all, who they were, who they are now and Michonne tells her story to 
Elle
. 
Okafor
 explains that Rick and 
Thorne
 both possess something that he believes the 
CRM
 needs to become what it needs to be. Jadis quotes 
Negan
 that 
"people are a resource"
 while 
Nat
 explains that he's good at building and burning things, but it takes more than that at the end of the world. 
Beale
 notes that Rick had tried to escape four times and wonders why he's here. Thorne recognizes that there's someone that Rick loves out there while Michonne tearfully asks Rick if he still loves her which Rick promises that he always does.

Picking up the ring, Rick puts it on Michonne's finger. Michonne tells Rick that 
"it sounds simple, right? We go in, you get the 
briefing
, I get the dossier she left behind. We bring what we know to the 
city
, then go 
home
. Together".
 However, Michonne states that it's never that simple.

Near Cascadia Base, Rick and Michonne, wearing the two uniforms, walk away from Jadis' parked helicopter and kiss. Rick and Michonne split up and Rick approaches the front gate with his hands raised. Rick introduces himself as Sergeant Major Rick Grimes to the 
Frontliners
 at the gate, acknowledging that they probably think that he's dead. As he's let into the base, Rick recalls 
his father
 telling Rick that he didn't need to be scared, that it was just the burning.

Outside, the disguised Michonne creeps along the perimeter fence as a bloated walker follows her and a Frontliner approaches from the other direction. When the Frontliner arrives, only the walker can be seen which he quickly puts down with his rifle's 
bayonet
. As the Frontliner reports that the threat has been neutralized and he's going to take a sweep of the perimeter, Michonne drops out of the tree that she had climbed onto the edge of the campus. Finding Jadis' quarters, Michonne picks the lock and looks around the room which is filled with Jadis' artwork.

Michonne frantically searches through Jadis' room for the dossier without success. Finally, on the windowsill near a portrait of 
Gabriel
, Michonne finds the dossier hidden inside of the cat sculpture that Jadis had been 
working on
 when Rick had approached 
the Scavengers
 for help against 
the Saviors
. In the cover letter, Jadis outlines the truth about 
lying
 to Elsick, about Rick being a "
B
" when she had traded him, the well-organized 
network
 of communities that Rick had created, his strategic abilities, the 
Savior conflict
, Michonne's abilities and loyalty to Rick and her role in the death of Okafor. Jadis also tells whoever finds the letter about Alexandria and urges its destruction to ensure the survival and safety of the Civic Republic. Michonne angrily tears the dossier up into little pieces that she then collects and keeps so that no one can find them. As Michonne goes to leave, a Frontliner pushes an envelope under the door, only to have it be stopped by Michonne's foot. As the woman enters, believing that Jadis is home, Michonne grabs a coil of wire off of the table, overpowers the Frontliner and strangles her to death before stomping on her head to ensure that the woman doesn't reanimate.

In a flashback, as they lay together, Rick tells his wife that he had missed her so much that words can't even say it right. Michonne reassures Rick that he doesn't have to, and she knows. Rick wonders if they're crazy, and Michonne calls them certifiable.

In flashbacks, Rick kills 
Pete Anderson
, Michonne stabs out 
the Governor
's eye, Rick jumps off of the 
RV
 onto the hanging 
Library Survivor
, and Michonne fights walkers on 
Oceanside
's beach.

By the entrance to the base, Frontliners move crates of supplies, including stuffed rabbits. On her way out, Michonne picks up a stuffed rabbit that had fallen and gives it to a passing Frontliner. Growing concerned by the implications, Michonne remembers leaving the 
King County Café
 with Carl, defending Rick from walkers as he carries an injured Carl during the 
Alexandria Walker Invasion
, facing off against 
Jocelyn's Group
, fighting walkers with 
Judith
, hugging her children, and burying Carl with Rick after the 
Bombing of Alexandria
.

Suspicious, Michonne makes her way to an auditorium as a briefing for the Frontliners starts. The presenter tells his audience that one of the most sensitive aspects of 
Operation N1W
 is the Child Evacuation Protocol. The projector switches from a map of 
Portland
 with drop zones marked to pictures of various children.

In a flashback, Michonne asks if they were born this way. The two remember Rick shooting at the Saviors in the 
Satellite Outpost
, and killing 
Gareth
, a bound Michonne kicking 
Merle Dixon
 in the face and decapitating 
Crowley
, and Rick getting flung through a window. Rick tells Michonne that he guesses so..

In flashbacks, Rick aims his gun, Michonne holds her sword and fights walkers, and Rick falls off of his horse and is impaled on rebar.

In the auditorium, the presenter tells his audience that, through CRM Frontliner embeds living in Portland under false identities, the organization has, over the years, had operatives enmeshed in the Portland school system to facilitate an evacuation of selected children. Sitting in the audience, Michonne watches the presentation with growing shock and horror at what the CRM is planning. The presenter explains that once the operation on Portland begins, children will be airlifted away from three school sites that will result in an evacuation of possibly 10 percent of the children in the city before Portland is gassed and its population is liquidated.

In a flashback, Rick tells Michonne that they will tell the Civic Republic what the CRM does, like the 
Massacre of Nat's Group
 and whatever else they do. Rick and Michonne know that if they don't expose the CRM's actions, no one else will. Rick states that you don't leave people behind while Michonne agrees that this is the shit they do.

In a series of flashbacks, two CRM Reclamation Team members confront 
Al
, CRM forces swarm 
the Perimeter
, and Beale 
leads
 Okafor's funeral, crops grow in Alexandria, oil shoots into the sky from 
a well
 and the Commonwealth train passes through the 
depot
. After waking up from his coma in 
Harrison Memorial Hospital
, Rick touches some dead flowers, Michonne arrives at the 
prison
, 
Ezekiel
 stabs a walker, and 
Daryl
, Negan, 
Morgan
, 
Eugene
, 
Carol
, and 
Maggie
 appear at various moments of their journey, ending with Rick making his way through the hospital after awakening from his coma.

In the auditorium, the presenter explains that the bubble windows will be in blackout and the children will not see or hear what's happening to the city. The man gives advice on handling the children and the trauma that both the children and the participating forces will experience. Michonne keys her radio several times.

In a flashback, Rick tells Michonne that they'll get back to the Civic Republic in Jadis' helicopter. Rick will fly them to 
jump points
 for the refuels that the CRM won't expect. If anything happens at the base, Michonne is to key her radio and Rick will get back to her as soon as he can and Michonne states that he will if she can be gotten back to.

In Beale's office, Rick's radio experiences several bursts of static from Michonne signaling him. Rick turns down the volume and brushes it off as it being Thorne who had gone through this and thought that it would be good to talk it out.

The presenter directs the Frontliners to keep the children's focus on the comfort items that they'll furnish the kids with and to tell the kids that they will be okay rather than it will be okay. Any one of the children could prove to be the difference in their civilization's survival. The presentation stops on a child who looks very similar to 
R.J.
 and Michonne flashes back on spending time with Carl, Judith and R.J. Unable to take it anymore, an utterly horrified Michonne leaves.

Emerging outside, Michonne prepares to make her escape the same way that she snuck in. Michonne reaches the point that she had sneaked into the base, but can't bring herself to leave with everything that she's learned. Michonne turns back, grabbing a large case of 
M67 Grenades
.

The elevator returns, but the occupant proves to be Michonne who tells Rick that they can't go home yet. Having gotten the Echelon Briefing and seen the Frontliner briefing respectively, Rick and Michonne both know that the CRM are about to launch another genocide. Michonne warns Rick that there's an entire tent of bombs outside, the CRM are going to evacuate the kids and then kill a whole city of people. With the CRM about to enact their plan and no time to warn anyone, Rick and Michonne are the only ones who can stop them. 
"We have to stop them, because we can stop them",
 Michonne concludes and Rick agrees that they can still go home, but the CRM must be stopped first. As Rick joins her on the elevator, Michonne asks her husband what's in the case Rick brought with him.

In the woods, Thorne sees that Beale isn't near the perimeter fence as Rick had claimed and wonders what Rick's up to.

In Beale's office, Michonne threads wire through the grenades in the supply case that she took, crafting a makeshift bomb. An impressed Rick asks how she came up with this and Michonne reveals that she took some inspiration from Nat. Packing up, Rick reveals that Beale had told him that Rick could lead the CRM one day, causing Michonne to laugh, guessing that Rick was right after all: he could do this all by himself. Rick suggests that they could just go, but Michonne tells her husband that this is what they have to do, asking what sort of world they're making for their children if they walk away from something like this. Emotional, Rick tells Michonne that he's mad at the time that he's missed, at not seeing their kids growing up, and Rick thinks about that time, and he just wants to go back. The couple kisses and reassures each other that they are back, and this is the shit they do.

On the tarmac outside, the entire Frontliner corps sits waiting before a stage for the CRM Force Command to brief them on their mission.

Thorne enters Beale's office looking for Rick and finds it empty aside from Rick's prosthetic hand which he has abandoned on the windowsill. Thorne instantly realizes that something is very wrong.

Rick and Michonne enter a large tent behind the gathering Frontliners where numerous canisters of 
Chlorine Gas
 are being stored and begin unloading their makeshift bomb. As the briefing commences, Rick and Michonne wire grenades connected to each other to the cannisters lining both sides of the tent. Once they're finished, Rick promises his wife that this is the last time that they'll be apart and while Michonne knows that she should be scared, she's not because of Rick. Rick gives Beale's sword to Michonne, and they open the large supply crate where Rick and Michonne have hidden the zombified Beale and the Frontliner that Rick had killed.

Thorne recalls Rick enlisting her help to get Michonne into the consignment program, telling Thorne that the CRM would think Rick emotional and indebted to Michonne if he did it and Thorne telling Rick that she put her neck out for the two and they need to take care of this. Thorne remembers playing poker with Rick and Rick's insistence that his wife isn't gone. Thorne finally puts the pieces together and realizes that "Dana Bethune" is actually Rick's wife.

Rick and Michonne each attach the end of the wire from one of the rows of the grenades to one of the walkers. Cutting the two free of their bonds, Rick and Michonne start Beale and the Frontliner following them in opposite directions, turning the two walkers into makeshift fuses for their bomb. Outside, Rick and Michonne make a run for it through the shipping containers behind the tents, but Thorne stops them at gunpoint. Aware that Rick had lied to her, Thorne demands answers. Shooting at their feet, Thorne forces the two to remove their helmets and bag and orders them to turn around, go back inside and undo whatever they did and when she finds Beale they're going to regret this.

Holding hands, Rick and Michonne head back to the tent while Thorne somewhat frantically assures herself that they're going to fix this. 
"It never died. It won't stop. It can't stop",
 Michonne declares. The two walkers reach the ends of the tent and the ends of the wire that they're attached to. Taking advantage of Thorne's shock at seeing a zombified Beale, Rick and Michonne dash to the side as the pins are pulled on all of the grenades attached to the chlorine gas cannisters. Michonne has Rick pull a CRM flag down over them and cuts open a water tank, spilling water over the couple as an additional form of protection from the deadly gas that's about to be released. The grenades detonate, creating a massive explosion and shockwave that consumes Major General Beale, the CRM Force Command and all of the Frontliners as well as releasing all of the deadly chlorine gas, killing the entire gathering of more than 2,000 people.

In the aftermath of the explosion, zombified Frontliners begin wandering around. Under the flag, Michonne tells Rick that they have to wait just a little bit longer as the gas breaks up quickly. Wearing a gas mask, a still alive Thorne searches for the couple. Rick decides to rush Thorne for the mask while Michonne gets the other mask, citing the fact that Michonne is the armed one of the two. Pulling wet cloth over their mouths, the couple rushes out and Rick attacks Thorne who accuses Rick of destroying their chance and the whole world. Walkers converge on Rick, giving Thorne the chance to run away and retrieve her gun as Rick tries to fight them off.

As Thorne tries to get a bead on Rick, Michonne -- now wearing a gas mask -- attacks her with Beale's sword. Recognizing Michonne as the woman who Rick was trying to get to, Thorne demands to know how she found Rick, and Michonne tells her that she never gave up and never gave herself up like Thorne did. Michonne demands to know where Rick is, and Thorne tells her to turn around as a zombified Frontliner approaches, and Rick is cornered against a container by the walkers. Thorne shoots at the walker who Michonne uses as a shield before shoving it headfirst into the other woman's bayonet. Thorne insists that Michonne doesn't understand because in a dead world love is dead, but Michonne angrily states that love doesn't die. Kicking Beale's sword off of the ground and into her hand, Michonne gets under Thorne's guard and stabs her in the chest and reiterates that love doesn't die. Rick manages to pull the pin of a grenade that one of the walkers is wearing and takes cover as it detonates, blowing up the walkers.

Much to Michonne's relief, she finds Rick unharmed after the explosion, having been shielded by some of the walkers closest to him. Michonne drops the sword and the two hug. Dying, Thorne hands Rick her gas mask, telling him that 
"Okafor was right. He was right. You just have to hope Beale was wrong".
 Attempting to escape, Rick and Michonne find walkers closing in from all directions. Michonne climbs on top of one of the shipping containers as Rick grabs a gun from one of the walkers and shoots several to cover his wife's escape. Michonne helps Rick up in turn and they remove their gas masks as the chlorine gas finally breaks up. Rick and Michonne jump from container to container, making their escape from the walkers and the base through an area free of walkers at the other end of the containers.

A Civic Republic 
newscaster
 reports on the wide-ranging ramifications of Operation N1W and Rick and Michonne's exposure of the CRM's atrocities. With the demise of the entire Frontliner force and CRM Force Command, including Major General Johnathan Beale, and the shocking revelations regarding all of their operations and activities, the 
Civic Republic Council
 voted unanimously for emergency oversight over the remaining forces of the CRM. The CRM's command hierarchies and layers of operational secrecy indicates that infantry units didn't participate in the atrocities perpetrated by the highest levels of the CRM, providing hope for immediate 
reform of the organization
. In another stunning vote by the CRC overturning CRM guidance, free movement has been established for the Civic Republic. Citizens are now allowed to leave at will and the city will welcome new citizens as they arrive. With oversight of the military in the CRC's hands, the CRM's priority has shifted beyond the Civic Republic's defense to engaging with, assisting and even airlifting any survivors or communities that they may encounter.

Rick and Michonne ride in the back of a CRM helicopter, looking at the iPhone with Michonne and Judith's portrait and 
Benjiro
's message of hope that had helped to bring them back together. Michonne takes Rick's shaking hand in comfort.

As Judith sits on the steps of a house wearing Rick's old 
Colt Python
 and her 
katana
, Michonne finally makes contact with her daughter over the radio. In a field nearby, Rick and Michonne emerge from the helicopter and rush to greet their children, having finally returned home, although Rick hesitates briefly after having been away for so long and missed so much of Judith and R.J.'s lives. Sobbing, Judith hugs her father, telling Rick that she knew that he was still out there, 
"I just never wanted you to feel alone".
 Rick admits that he thought that he was, before realizing that he wasn't. Judith tells Michonne that she got her back and Michonne reminds her daughter that Judith told her to. Meeting his father for the first time, R.J. asks if he's The Brave Man which Rick and Michonne confirm. Touching R.J.'s 
hat
, which had once been Rick's before he'd passed it down to his children, Rick tells his son to call him Dad. R.J. states that he knew that Rick would come back, that he believed it. Rick and R.J. hug for the first time which turns into a group hug of the reunited Grimes family. CRM helicopters fly overhead, carrying supplies to help other communities in need thanks to the changes that Rick and Michonne had brought to the organization.

Trivia
[
]


Michonne was originally slated to have a cameo appearance in "
Days Gone Bye
", but it was never filmed.


Glen Mazzara
 admitted during his Q&A at comicbook.com that Michonne and the 
Governor
 were the hardest characters to cast.


Robert Kirkman
 stated 'We looked at a lot of talented people that were really fantastic but we were waiting for that one spark, that one moment where everyone was completely in agreement and completely excited and we felt like we had the essence of this fictional character that just randomly appeared in another person, and that person was 
Danai Gurira
. She kind of came in and really blew us all away. She's got incredible presence, and she's got a theatre background, and is very physical and was just perfect for the role.'


In preparation for the role Gurira practiced swordsmanship with a sword instructor, additionally she viewed several samurai films. 'I worked with a sword master - he's also a stunt man' - Gurira explained 'you just work very intensively. We just worked all the time. She wasn't trained in the bamboo forests of Japan. She figured it out, but there are aspects of even the way she's portrayed in the comic book where there's just a calm about how she utilizes it that I found very interesting.'


Upon discussing on implementing the comic book counterpart traits, Danai stated "I was trying to really investigate a character and allow her to have as much dimension as possible and crack it open even more. What you see through the writing and vision of the creator, you add to it by bringing your full humanity and by really delving into the character's background and their motives and fears; all those things can make a multidimensional character come to life. That's how I've been trained from the beginning and how I've created characters in the past on the stage or through my playwriting. I plan to bring all of that to the table to allow Michonne to be as rich and complex as possible. I'm excited to bring her to life as someone who really has a lot of life and a lot of complexity.
[9]


She owns a personal necklace as a memento.
[10]


Just like her comic counterpart, Michonne's signature weapon is a 
katana
 which she found at the start of the apocalypse.


While not confirmed on the show, many instances allude to Michonne's profession pre-apocalypse being a lawyer, like her comic counterpart. Michonne's knowledge of laws, acting to construct governing laws in the communities, her techniques when interrogating new survivors, her familiarity with prison tattoos as noted with 
Magna's
, and her pre-apocalypse affluent lifestyle that could be afforded by being a lawyer all allude to that being her profession.


Even though Michonne and Rick never got married, Angela Kang revealed in an interview "They were a committed couple to each other but were not officially married and they were both OK with that. For all intents and purposes, she was Rick's wife. That's kind of our thinking about it."

Rick ends up actually proposing to Michonne in "
Become
".


Michonne has caused the most amputations out of all other characters.


Michonne has killed the eighth largest amount of living characters with a total of at least 43 victims, 
Morgan
 has the seventh largest with at least 45, 
The Governor
 has the sixth largest with at least 62, 
Rick
 has the fifth largest with at least 68, Daryl has the fourth largest with at least 78, 
Carol
 has the third largest with at least 102, 
Simon
 has the second largest with at least 172, and 
Negan
 has the largest with at least 225.


Michonne is the third longest living female character in the TV Series, the second longest being 
Maggie
 and the longest being Carol.


Michonne is one of the six 
TV Universe
 characters to appear in 
The Ones Who Live
, the others being 
Rick Grimes
, 
Anne
, 
Aiden
, 
Bailey
, and 
Gabriel Stokes
.


Michonne is one of the twelve characters in the 
TV universe
 to be pregnant during the events of the apocalypse. The others being 
Maggie Rhee
, 
Lori Grimes
, 
Eileen
, 
Ava
, 
Vida
, an unnamed 
Sanctuary Worker
, an unnamed 
Kingdommer
, 
Jane Carroll
, 
Rosita Espinosa
, 
Nabila
, 
Grace Mukherjee
, and 
Rachel
.


It has been confirmed that 
Season 10
 is going to be Danai Gurira's final season, appearing only in a handful of episodes.

This is proven true, as she appeared in five episodes and her final episode is "
What We Become
".


However, she made a surprise return in "
Rest in Peace
".


In 
Season 9
, Michonne, like Daryl, bares a 
X
 shaped scar on her back. "
Scars
" reveals she was branded this scar by 
Winnie
, on 
Jocelyn
's orders.


Michonne is the fifth most-appearing character, having appeared in 95 episodes.


Michonne's last name was confirmed to be 
Hawthorne
 in 
The Walking Dead: Onslaught
.

It is interesting to note that the last name has not been used in credits or on the show nor has it been mentioned by any of the cast and crew in interviews and other media. The surname 
Hawthorne
 is solely referenced to in 
The Walking Dead: Onslaught
.


However, Angela Kang later confirmed on Twitter that Michonne's surname was indeed Hawthorne. Unlike her comic counterpart, it's her maiden name rather than her married name.
[2]


Michonne is a playable character in other media such as 
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Mobile
, 
Magic: The Gathering
, 
Brawlhalla
, and recently 
Fortnite
 where she and Daryl Dixon were simply abducted by 
John Jones
.


In "
A Certain Doom
", Michonne is mentioned by Daryl as he sets traps with Carol as they talk about her mission to find Rick.


Michonne appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
", "
A New Deal
", "
Variant
" and "
Outpost 22
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Michonne has been captured eight times.

She was temporarily captured in the episode "
This Sorrowful Life
" by 
Merle
.


She was temporarily captured second time in the episode "
Dead Weight
" by 
Philip
 alongside 
Hershel
.


She was captured in the episode "
A
" by 
Gareth
 at 
Terminus
.


She was captured again in the episode "
East
" by 
Saviors
 led by 
Dwight
.


In a flashback, she was captured in the episode "
Scars
" by 
Jocelyn's group
.


She was captured years later in the episode "
The Calm Before
" by 
Whisperers
 alongside Daryl, 
Carol
 and 
Yumiko
.


She was captured in the episode "
What We Become
" by 
Virgil
.


She was captured by the 
CRM
 in "
Gone
" of 
The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live
. However, it was Rick who captured her, and it was a part of a plan between Rick and Michonne.


Michonne is one of twelve characters to survive the 
TV Series
 who also survive in the 
Comic Series
, the others being 
Maggie Rhee
, 
Eugene Porter
, 
Aaron
, 
Hershel Rhee
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Magna
, 
Yumiko Okumura
, 
Lydia
, 
Juanita Sanchez
, 
Michael Mercer
, and 
Pamela Milton
.


Michonne and 
Maggie Rhee
 are the only characters introduced in 
Season 2
 that are confirmed to be alive.

Michonne, Maggie, and 
Nate
 are the only characters introduced in Season 2 to not die in the 
TV Series
.


It's possible that Michonne's fake name she uses in the Civic Republic, Dana Bethune, is a reference to her actress 
Danai Gurira
 and to civil rights activist 
Mary Bethune
.


In "
Bye
", broke a previous record number of 68 walker kills at the 
Harvest Point
 culling facility as mentioned in "
What We
".

This record presumably refers to the number of kills gotten in a single day, not the number of kills total.


The previous holder of this record was Rick.


According to Danai Gurira, the moment Michonne started falling in love with Rick, albeit subconsciously, was when he bit out 
Joe
's jugular in "
A
".
