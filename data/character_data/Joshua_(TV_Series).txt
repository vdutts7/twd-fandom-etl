Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Joshua's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he had a 
mother
 and 
grandfather
.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Joshua and his family joined a community called 
the Kingdom
.



Season 7
[
]


"
The Well
"
[
]


Joshua walks around town with another boy while holding a soccer ball.



Season 8
[
]


"
Some Guy
"
[
]


In a flashback, Joshua is with his mother and grandfather as she kneels down and comforts him, placing a flower picked by him into her armband before hugging him. Joshua and his family are among the Kingdommers to gather in the center of town and listen to 
Ezekiel
's speech about his confidence in the 
militia
. He smiles as he listens and cheers with the other townspeople. Later, he and his grandfather are saddened when they realize his mother was among the Kingdom militia killed by the Saviors.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"
[
]


Joshua is among the Kingdommers rounded up by the Saviors when they invade the settlement at night. After Ezekiel sets off a distraction, Joshua flees the Kingdom to the safe house with the other residents.



Season 9

"
Who Are You Now?
"
[

Following the six-year time jump, Joshua has not been seen in the Kingdom nor was he among the Kingdom refugees to relocate to Hilltop or Alexandria, suggesting he either left the community or died due to unknown causes. Regardless, his current location and fate remain unknown.

Trivia
[
]


It was revealed that this extra was selected by director 
Greg Nicotero
 from the background cast to be included in the scene with his mother. The name 
Joshua
 was assigned to this extra upon shooting the scene, though he was left uncredited and had no lines.


With the second, multi-year time jump in 
Season 9
, Joshua's fate remains unclear as all child extras from the communities were removed from casting due to the age differences (ie. their characters would be 5-6 years older in the show and their real-life ages would not match their characters' age and physical growth).
