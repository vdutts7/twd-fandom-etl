,,,Nothing is known about Crystal's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"Crystal survived the early stages of the outbreak and took residence in a 
FEMA
 camp where she was later evacuated to a safe-zone named the 
Hilltop Colony
, upon where Crystal settled into the farming community where she became integrated with the fellow residents, most notably 
Gregory
 and 
Paul Rovia
, and thus became a prominent member.
Crystal was present at the time of the arrival of 
the Saviors
, a notorious group of survivors who demanded half of the Hilltop's supplies in exchange for leaving the farming community unscathed. Though initially reluctant to comply the Saviors demonstrated their motives through publicly executing a 16-year-old resident 
Rory
. Following this barbaric event, the colony entered into a period of dread and submission and thus were forced to comply under 
Negan Smith
's rule, were due to their limited resources and manpower they were unable to rebel against their savage oppressors.
Throughout the following months, the community begrudgingly began to gather supplies to present towards the Saviors in their desperate attempt to keep them at bay. Crystal was assigned as a member of a supply group tasked with routinely delivering a portion of supplies directed towards one of the Saviors compounds.
Approximately 20 months into the apocalypse, Crystal was part of a supply exchange conducted between the Hilltop and the Saviors alongside 
Craig
, 
Andy
, 
Ethan
, 
Tim
, and 
Marsha
. Upon delivering the supplies, Negan personally felt unsatisfied with the amount received and thus had both Tim and Marsha executed and Craig imprisoned located in one of the Saviors' compounds. Negan ordered the remaining Hilltoppers to return home and, in exchange for Craig's release, kill Gregory and return back with his head as evidence of his death.
Upon returning from the failed delivery, Crystal watches as Ethan stabs 
Gregory
, and attempts to stop 
Rick
 when he tackles Ethan. She watches in horror as Rick stabs Ethan and is frozen in shock after Rick gets up after killing Ethan. After regaining her senses, Crystal punches him but she is grabbed and thrown to the ground by 
Michonne
 before she can do anything else. A short time later, Michonne watches from inside the Barrington House as Crystal cries over Ethan's corpse. She is among the townspeople to attend his funeral in Hilltop.
Crystal is among the several Hilltoppers killed during the Saviors' tainted weapons attack on Hilltop. She was either killed during the battle itself or was injured and later succumbed to her wounds from the tainted weapons.
