“


So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie. And I owe my life to you all, twice over. A bunch of us do. 
Enid
 says that you want 
Gregory
 to get us to fight the Saviors with you. Is that true? (...) Do you think we can win, that we really could beat them? Us? (...) Well, Enid says you could show us the way. I'm ready.

Maggie

Trivia
[
]


Bertie had lines with 
Gregory
 in her trailer at Hilltop in "
Something They Need
" but the scene was cut.
[2]


In an Instagram clip, Karen Ceesay shared a story that she suffered a big cut on her forehead days before filming so the costume department gave her a teal scarf to wear on her head during the episode, including her scene with Gregory.


In "
Mercy
", Karen Ceesay revealed that she asked production if she could be included in a shot in the episode as she noticed she was not in the camera's range during filming. As a result, they filmed the short shot of Bertie and Maggie in the beginning of the episode. The actress revealed that she and Lauren Cohan were talking about curtains, as audio in that shot wasn't being included in the episode.
[3]


In the same clip, Karen confirmed that Bertie is the TV series counterpart for 
Brianna
.


In "
The Bridge
", it was revealed that Bertie serves as a teacher who gives lessons to the children of the Hilltop.


As of Season 10, Karen Ceesay was promoted from Co-Star to Also Starring.


Bertie was credited in "
What It Always Is
" but did not appear in the episode. According to the actress, she had lines with 
Aaron
 but the scene was cut.
