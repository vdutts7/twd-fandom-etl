,,,"Although his personality is not well known, Tomas was shown to be an untrustworthy, sly, hostile and homicidal individual. He was shown to be a remorseless, cold-blooded murderer as shown when he murdered his ally Big Tiny after the latter was infected, and then tried to murder 
Rick Grimes
 twice, an act that eventually led to his own demise.","Nothing is known about Tomas' life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was a convicted criminal being held in the prison for an unknown crime.","At the onset of the outbreak, a riot started at the prison. Tomas, 
Oscar

Andrew

Big Tiny
, and 
Axel
 were escorted to the cafeteria by a guard. They were locked inside as the guard went out to call for backup, but he never returned. The five inmates then spent the next 10 months locked inside the cafeteria, without knowing what was going on outside and survived off the large quantity of food left behind in the cafeteria.

's leg.
Confused about what had just happened, Tomas and the other prisoners ask who Rick and his group are, thinking that they are bandits that have raided the prison. Rick tells Tomas and the others about what has happened to the world, which the prisoners were totally unaware of. Realizing that this prison is the safest place to live, Tomas threatens Rick's group, claiming that the prison belongs to the prisoners, and Rick and his group must leave. After an intense discussion, Rick makes an agreement to attain a share of the cafeteria's food in exchange for helping the prisoners clear out walkers from a cell block for the prisoners to live in. During the process of killing walkers, Tomas acts increasingly belligerent towards Rick and the others. Big Tiny gets deeply scratched by a walker and says he feels fine and nothing was going to happen. As the other prisoners ask Rick if there is any way of saving Big Tiny's life, Tomas kills Big Tiny with no hesitation by brutally smashing his head in. This raises concern for Rick and Daryl, who prepare to take him out if he makes any further hostile moves. Later, the group enters the laundry room with the entrance to the other cellblock, and Rick instructs Tomas to open a single door. After opening both and allowing in the full group of zombies, Tomas justifies his actions by saying ""Shit happens."" While the group members are killing walkers in the laundry room, Tomas then intentionally swings his weapon too close to Rick whilst attacking a walker, and then pushes another walker onto him. Rick manages to survive after Daryl stabs this walker in the back of the head. The prisoners finish killing the remaining walkers. Tomas shrugs it off with a comment, to which Rick nods his head and agrees, saying ""I get it. 'Shit happens'""; then after they stare each other down, Rick drives his machete into Tomas' skull, killing him.","Killed By
