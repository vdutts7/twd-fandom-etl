Overview


Cole is a courageous man, who is one of 
Maggie
's most trusted allies. He isn't afraid of voicing his own opinions even if they contrast Maggie's, such as convincing her to stop for the day when she wants to keep going to 
Alexandria
. Cole is also a skilled fighter, enough so that he is recruited to go to 
Meridian
 to take out the 
Reapers
. However, when the Reapers attack the group, he ends up being one of the group's first victims to the Reapers when his hand gets cut off and throat slit.



Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Cole's life prior to or as the outbreak began. 



Post-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Several years into the outbreak, Cole joined a community called 
Meridian
. A few years later, Meridian was attacked by a 
hostile group of raiders
, forcing him and the remaining survivors to flee.

"
Home Sweet Home
"


Cole accompanies 
Elijah
 when going to meet 
Daryl
 and 
Carol
 with Maggie, and is introduced to the two by the latter as her companions. Cole joins the four when Carol shows Maggie the remains of 
Hilltop
, and explains how 
Negan
 was both there when the 
Whisperers
 attacked and the reason 
Alpha
 died. Cole asks if they're supposed to just live alongside Negan in 
Alexandria
 despite the fact that he burned down the Hilltop and killed Maggie's husband, to which Daryl replies that they're still figuring things out.

As Carol leaves to head back to Alexandria, Cole, Maggie and Elijah begin to lead them to where the rest of their group is camped. Daryl trails behind Maggie, 
Kelly
 catches up and volunteers to help with the mission, as she also wants to look for 
Connie
. The group walks for most of the day, until Cole informs Maggie that there is only half an hour of daylight left. Maggie wants to keep going, but Cole convinces her to call it a day and find some shelter. Maggie decides to clear out walkers from nearby a parking lot, which Daryl and Kelly are uneasy about but go along with. Things go well at first, until Maggie notices a group of walkers coming out of a container and attempts to close the door, injuring herself in the process. Luckily, she manages to close the door with Daryl and Elijah's help.

In the morning, the group wakes up and prepares to leave, when they're interrupted by a walker. As Elijah dispatches it, Cole wonders where Kelly is, since she's supposed to be on watch. Just as they're about to arrive to the rendezvous, they see a smoke cloud rising in the distance. Horrified, Maggie runs ahead, closely followed by the others. Maggie desperately searches for Hershel in the burned-out building, but doesn't find anything apart form the corpses of two of her group members. 

Cole is sure that this is the work of the 
Reapers
, a group that attacked and destroyed their former home and apparently followed them to 
Virginia
. Maggie is determined to find the rest of the group and her son. Daryl finds some footprints, including Hershel's, and determines that the group fled north. He also assures Maggie they will find the group responsible. After a while, the trail splits, so the group decides to split up as well, with Daryl and Maggie heading in one direction and Elijah, Cole and Kelly in the other. Cole hears some noises, so instructs Elijah and Kelly to take cover. When they decide to move again, Elijah remains still.

Later, as Maggie and Daryl are struggling to fight against a highly tactical and well-adapted survivalist 
Reaper
, Kelly manages to shoot the man with Daryl's dropped crossbow, incapacitating him as Cole and Elijah join up with her and surround him. As Maggie tries to get the man to tell them who he is and what his group wants, he merely responds with "Pope marked you" before pulling the pin on a grenade in his satchel. Maggie, Daryl, Kelly, Cole, and Elijah all duck down and away from the ensuing blast, with blows the man into a red mist.

Maggie later manages to find Hershel hiding in a tree, and the group heads back to Alexandria. They stop at the same storage yard from before for the night. As they finally reach Alexandria, they find it in near ruins, with many of the walls destroyed and knocked down, buildings burnt, and crops trampled by the Whisperers during their initial assault on the settlement. Cole subsequently joins the community with his comrades, as Maggie glares at a watching Negan.

"
Acheron: Part I
"


Cole is chatting with fellow Wardens 
Frost
, 
Agatha
, and 
Duncan
 when Maggie and her group's return to Alexandria after their mission at 
Fort Connors
. She is overjoyed to see her friends again and chats with Cole and the others. Later during a meeting, Cole listens as Maggie explains that Frost, Agatha, and Duncan were separated and believed to have been killed after 
Reapers
 attacked their 
village
. Cole and his fellow Wardens agree to accompany Maggie and a group of Alexandrians to Meridian to take out the Reapers and secure the food and water supplies to feed everyone in Alexandria.

Part of a group consisting of Maggie, Daryl, Alden, Frost, Elijah, Gage, Negan, Agatha, Duncan, Roy, and Gabriel, the survivors utilize Negan's familiarity with the DC area to travel to Meridian. Due to the heavy rain storm, the survivors are forced to head into the subway tunnels to complete the journey. While in the tunnels, they come across hundreds of body bags, many containing walkers in them. At some point while dispatching the body bag walkers, 
Gage
 and 
Roy
 go missing, along with the group's ammo and supplies. Shortly after this realization, a large group of walkers appear, forcing the other survivors to move forward in the tunnel without being able to search for Gage or Roy. He is able to make it into a subway car before the walkers are able to catch up with his group.



"
Acheron: Part II
"


Cole and the rest of the Meridian mission survivors make their way through the subway tunnels and successfully fight their way through the undead to safety, despite losing 
Gage
, who was killed after running away from the group and becoming separated. With the storm subsided, Cole and the rest of the group traverse down a road when suddenly 
Roy
 is shot and killed and a flying knife severs his hand clean. The Reapers have launched an ambush on the survivors.
