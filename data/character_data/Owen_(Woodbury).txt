Trivia
[
]


Owen is named after the actor who portrays him, Owen Ridings.

The actor has a sister, 
Eryn Ridings
, who also played a prison child named 
Eryn
.


In the 
Making Of
 video for "Infected" on the AMC website, Owen Ridings can be seen running down the stairs as he escapes the cell block, but this scene was changed as he played the role of the dead child.


While his death was never clearly seen on-screen, his death was confirmed by the actor.


Owen was supposed to appear outside working in a garden with his mother, but the scene was cut.
