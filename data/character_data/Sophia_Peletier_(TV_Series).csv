,,,"Sophia was a shy, quiet and smart young girl. Although her personality was not well shown, it is assumed she was very nice, as stated by Carol in ""
The Grove
"", who said that ""[Sophia] didn't have a mean bone in her body"". It can also be said that she was good at making friends, as she was close to Eliza Morales and Carl Grimes, who seemed to care about her deeply.","Sophia was born in 1998 and grew up under the loving care of her mother and the verbal and physical abuse of her father, who consistently neglected her. When she was an infant, Sophia used to wake up at 3:00 a.m. every morning and cry, causing her 
father
 to become irritated and stay with a friend until she calmed down.
Throughout her childhood, Sophia and Carol were victims of verbal and physical abuse from Ed. At some point, Sophia was taken by Carol to a shelter in Atlanta in an attempt to get away from Ed, but after a day and a half, they went back to him. After they went back, Ed beat them both severely.","During the onset of the outbreak, Sophia and her family traveled towards a supposedly safe-zone in Atlanta. On the way, they got caught in a traffic jam and befriended 
Shane
, 
Lori
, and 
Carl.
 Sometime after the city was napalmed by the military, they formed a campsite outside the outskirts of Atlanta, along with other survivors.","Killed By
Zombies
 
(Alive)
While Sophia is trying to find her way back to the group, she is attacked and bitten on the left shoulder by a walker and either dies of the infection or blood loss. Eventually, a zombified Sophia is found by Otis and is put into Hershel's barn.
Rick Grimes
 
(Zombified)
After Shane opens the barn and all the walkers are gunned down by the group, a zombified Sophia slowly walks out and is shot in the head by Rick.","For a more in-depth look at Sophia's relationships, read here:

.","On 
Talking Dead
, 
Robert Kirkman
 reveals that it was 
Otis
 who had placed Sophia in the barn and that she was already a walker when he found her. Since Rick nor Shane never mentioned that they were in the woods looking for a girl, and saving Carl became the main focus, Otis left for the 
high school
 and never returns before this discussion has a chance to take place.

He also mentioned that the scene where Otis placed the zombified Sophia into the barn was actually shot, but never made it to the final cut.


This means that Sophia was already dead by the end of ""
What Lies Ahead
"" since Otis left for the high school shortly after meeting the group in ""
Bloodletting
."" Thus Sophia presumably died on the day or night of her disappearance.


Also during 
Talking Dead
, show creators reveal that they shot the barn scene twice. Once with Sophia looking normal, the way the survivors wanted to see her, and the zombified version, which is the version that was aired in ""Pretty Much Dead Already"".


Sophia was bitten on the shoulder, which is what made her turn. Just before leaving her to kill the walkers chasing them, Rick makes a comment about keeping the sun over her ""left shoulder"" if she runs back to the group. When she is found as a walker, it can be seen that the walker that attacked her had bitten her on the left shoulder. It is unknown if this was done on purpose by the writers or was just a coincidence. This would mean that if Sophia understood Rick's instructions, she could have been bitten when she was on her way back to the highway.

However, when her tracks disappeared, 
Daryl
 stated that only Sophia's tracks were around. Rick specifically asked if there was signs of walker tracks when Sophia changed from following his directions.


In ""
The Grove
"", the puzzle on the table during Carol and 
Tyreese
's conversation was a picture of Sophia with her rainbow T-shirt, as revealed by 
Melissa McBride
 on the following 
Talking Dead
 episode.


Unlike her comic book counterpart, she had never started a relationship with Carl Grimes.


In ""
Look at the Flowers
"", Sophia is mentioned by 
Alpha
 during Carol's hallucinations.
