Gotta hand it to ya, you played your cards good. You played your people good! They ate that

Overview
[
]


Although he only appeared in one episode, Gunther appeared to be a particularly cruel and nasty Savior even by their standards in general, and was possibly one of the most heartless, unsavory and depraved foot soldiers among them, the other cruel one being 
Jared
. He seemed to have a hatred of 
Ezekiel
, appearing to take great pleasure in physically and mentally abusing him after kidnapping him and mocking him over how he'd gotten his people killed with a cold smile. 

At one point after being cut by Ezekiel he even went so far as to smear his own blood on Ezekiel's face in retaliation, indicating he was likely slightly mentally unstable. He seemed to be very ambitious and loyal to 
Negan
, attempting to follow the latter's orders to deliver Ezekiel to him personally and appearing to hope that he would subsequently move up in the Savior ranks and become more than just a "meaningless foot soldier" to his tyrannical leader. 

He didn't seem to care much for his fellow Saviors either, seeming to dismiss the fact that many of his cohorts were either dead or in conflict so long as he could prove himself to Negan by taking Ezekiel to him as a prize. In some respects he was also a bit of a hypocrite, as when he criticizes Ezekiel for "delusions of grandeur" and "roping his people into thinking he was a king" he fails to see the irony of those comments, which is that Negan, his own leader, had brainwashed him and the rest of his people into thinking 
he
 was a god-like figure who they knelt in the presence of. The fact that Gunther shot 
Alvaro
 dead and, in his last moments before being killed by 
Jerry
, threatened to decapitate Ezekiel and take his severed head to Negan, shows that he was more than capable of committing heinous acts of violence and murder.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Gunther's life prior to or as the outbreak began. 



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Gunther somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined.

Gunther aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 8
[
]


"
Some Guy
"
[
]


Having survived the attack on his outpost, Gunther remained hidden as his fellow Saviors were gunned down by the Kingdommers. When his enemies are massacred, Gunther follows 
Alvaro
, who was attempting to save 
Ezekiel
 from walkers, and shoots him dead through the back when he gets distracted, leaving Ezekiel completely vulnerable due to his leg injury. Gunther then takes Ezekiel, and confiscates his sword, leaving him with only his cane so that they could walk a bit faster with the plan to take him to the Sanctuary as a prisoner. While walking, Gunther taunts Ezekiel of how he would be nothing without 
Shiva
 and how "his people" are all dead. 

Coming across a gate that happens to be locked, Gunther realizes that the only way to get through would be to go over the barb-wired fence. He grabs Ezekiel's coat and throws it over the barbed wire, knocking Ezekiel to the ground, saying that he wanted to bring him back alive, but clearly can't due to walkers closing in on them and would prefer to mount his head atop a pike. Before Gunther can decapitate Ezekiel with his sword, 
Jerry
 runs up from behind with 
his battle axe
 and slices his body in half, killing Gunther instantly and saving Ezekiel's life, as well as avenging Alvaro.

Quotes

The following is a list of some of Gunther's most memorable quotes.





Season 8




"Hands up. (…) Let's 
move.
"
- Gunther taking Ezekiel captive after killing Alvaro, "
Some Guy
"





"Forgot about your blade. 
Give it to me.
 (…) You can keep the cane. (…) I'm gonna need your help. We got a big trip ahead of us."
- Gunther as he holds Ezekiel captive, "
Some Guy
"





"You made it this long. After pulling all the crap you did, you're gonna lie down now? (…) 
I'm Negan.
 Get up."
- Gunther forcing Ezekiel to get up, "
Some Guy
"





"Your people!? You mean all those sheep you roped into thinking you're a king? Yeah, I heard your story. We all did!"
- Gunther to Ezekiel about being a king, "
Some Guy
"





"You work at a circus? Yeah I thought maybe, but nah. They don't treat animals too nice at the circus. And that 
cat
 just loves you! Gave you everything, didn't it? Gave you an angle, a 
story.
"
- Gunther taunting Ezekiel, "
Some Guy
"





"Gotta hand it to ya, you played your cards good. You played your people good! They ate that 
horseshit
 right up! 
(laughs)
 They grew food for you. Built those walls for you. Hell, look at that! You got 'em all 
killed
 and they're still following you! Take away that title, what's left? Just some 
meaningless con man in a costume.
"
- Gunther taunting Ezekiel about getting his people killed, "
Some Guy
"





"It's over! Okay!? You took your shot, and it's over! (…) 
Delusions of grandeur.
"
- Gunther after Ezekiel tries to escape, "
Some Guy
"





"It is what it is. Negan was hoping to have your ass chained to the Sanctuary fence. You, the Widow, Rick. But your head on a pike will do just fine. Maybe break it up a little, avoid the obvious symmetry."
- Gunther as he is about to kill Ezekiel, also his last words, "
Some Guy
"

Trivia
[
]


Gunther's name was revealed during a 
Talking Dead
 segment.


Actor 
Whitmer Thomas
 stated that he portrayed Gunther in a way to get TV viewers to hate him by the time he was killed off.


Gunther saying to Ezekiel that his head on a pike would do just fine and then trying to decapitate him indirectly references Ezekiel being decapitated and having his head put on a pike by 
Alpha
 in the comics, although it’s unlikely this was intended.


Gunther is the only named character to be directly killed on-screen by 
Jerry
 in the 
TV Series
.
