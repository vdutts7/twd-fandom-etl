Overview
[
]


Tara initially came off as cold and hostile upon meeting 
The Governor
 as he made his way into her family's apartment building. She was seen exhibiting varying degrees of rude behavior towards him, even when 
Lilly
 insisted it wasn't necessary. 

As her character continues to be explored, we see that Tara's hard exterior is only a façade, which she presumably puts on for reasons of self-preservation or insecurity. In later appearances, she demonstrates a more friendly, compassionate, and honest nature. She is shown to be playful at times, such as when she played a game of tag with 
Meghan
, as well as when she expressed amusement at finding a yo-yo in a discarded bag with Glenn and 
Rosita
.

Tara is shown to express severe guilt for her involvement in the attack on the Prison that ultimately caused its downfall, as well as the deaths of 
Hershel Greene
 and countless other residents; even though she had little to no influence on the actual fight, she still bears the brunt of responsibility by virtue of having been there at all. This guilt eventually subsides after Tara is accepted into 
Rick Grimes
' group and receives forgiveness from him, as well as 
Glenn Rhee
 and 
Maggie Greene
. 

Throughout the fifth season, Tara shows numerous signs of developing emotional maturity and inner strength, often shown through her growing friendship with 
Eugene Porter
. The strength and determination she exhibits later gives Eugene the courage to display those same traits, saving Tara's life after she herself is seriously wounded and rendered unconscious during a supply run for the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
.

By the eighth season, Tara has grown much more cold and vengeful, especially towards 
the Saviors
, and she has a strong desire to kill them all, except for the workers and prisoners, to avenge her girlfriend, 
Denise Cloyd
, and her friends, Glenn, 
Abraham Ford
, and 
Olivia
. This shows that she is perfectly willing to eliminate human threats, just like most of the rest of her group. She was particularly hostile towards 
Dwight
, who was responsible for Denise's death, wanting to kill him despite his decision to switch sides and help them and conspiring with 
Daryl
, who likewise wanted all of the Saviors dead regardless of whether or nor they surrendered and likewise particularly despised Dwight, to do so. She was also the only one who participated in Daryl's plot to let 
walkers
 into the 
Sanctuary
 despite knowing that innocent workers and prisoners would die if they did so, showing that like Daryl, she has allowed her hatred to blind her to what is the morally correct thing to do. 

However, after Dwight lures his fellow Saviors away from their location, Tara seems to soften, and remembers how she had once been one of the Governor's people, acknowledging her own hypocrisy. When she thought she had been shot with a poisoned arrow by Dwight and would die soon, she accepted this and said she thought she deserved it for the way she had behaved before, stating she may have pushed Dwight into switching sides again. After realizing he had shot her with a clean arrow and she was not dying, she seemed to finally let go of her hatred and told Daryl she would no longer aid him in his desire to kill Dwight and all the other Saviors.

Following the 6-year time jump, and the deaths of Gregory and Jesus, as well as Maggie's departure, Tara has found herself as the leader of Hilltop. As a leader, she seems to be stern and pragmatic, but still kind, understanding, honest, and willing to listen to others. When 
Alden
 and 
Luke
 went missing, she wasn't willing to put an entire group of her people at risk to find them, by going out to face an unknown threat, preferring to return to Hilltop to get more information before acting. Though she appears certain in her decisions, she openly admits to 
Yumiko Okumura
 that she doesn't know if she knows what she's doing, inviting her to talk to her if she ever disagrees with one of her decisions, and is also quick to forgive Yumiko and her group for going against her orders to search for Luke, understanding their fear for the safety of their friend.

In her final moments, Tara proved her bravery and strength of character, as she fought to the death against 
Whisperers
, fighting to protect her friends until the very end.

When 
the Governor
 arrives at their apartment, Tara reluctantly allows him inside. After he tells them his story about what had happened before at this camp and introduces himself as Brian, Tara explains that she was in training to become a police officer. At Lilly's insistence, Tara allows him to stay in one of the empty apartments of the building.

After her father David passes away due to his cancer, Tara cries at his bedside. When he turns and almost bites her, the Governor saves her life. Later on, Tara thanks the Governor for saving her life and fist bumps him. 

Following this event, Tara and her family leave with the Governor, thinking he can possibly take them to a safer place and protect them. On the road, they are swarmed by a herd and in an attempt to escape, Tara runs away and twists her ankle, but is saved by Lilly. They trudge through the forest but are saved by another group of survivors.

Tara and her family are then granted shelter at Martinez's camp as long as they contribute. Later that day, Tara flirts with 
Alisha
 while Alisha is getting a cut treated by Lilly. They then would start a relationship over the following days. When the Governor takes leadership of the camp, Tara and Alisha help secure a fence around the campsite to protect it from walkers. Due to being distracted flirting with Alisha, a walker entered the camp and almost attacked Meghan. She is then left visibly shocked when the Governor manages to save Meghan.



"
Too Far Gone
"


When the Governor reveals his plan to try and take the 
West Georgia Correctional Facility
 using 
Hershel
 and 
Michonne
 as exchange hostages, Tara is the first member of the militia to accept taking part in the attack later that day. When negotiations were taking place at the prison, Rick tries to reason directly with Tara after noticing that she was insecure about what they were doing.  

After the Governor cruelly beheads Hershel, Tara realizes that she is on the wrong side and throws her weapon to the ground, refusing to be part of the battle. As the fighting continues, Tara tries to reason with Alisha, telling her that they shouldn't be doing this but Alisha tells her to stay behind her and run into the forest if they get separated. After a bomb explodes near her, a petrified Tara leaves Alisha behind. 



"
Inmates
"


Having survived the battle, Tara took refuge inside a fence to avoid being attacked by the walkers. As 
Glenn
 is leaving, he spots her in an almost catatonic state and convinces her to accompany him. 

As they reach the road, Tara mentions she regrets having trusted "Brian" and once he killed Hershel, she knew instantly that she was on the wrong side. Glenn responds that while he is not on good terms with her, he needs her help to find his wife Maggie. When walkers try to attack them, Glenn fights off the majority but collapses with fatigue. 

Tara attacks a walker that is about to bite him, repeatedly bashing its head in. She looks up to realize 
Abraham
, 
Eugene
, and 
Rosita
 have witnessed her heroic act. She then angrily and sarcastically asks them if they enjoyed the show.



"
Claimed
"


Having been picked up by Abraham's group, Tara rides along with an unconscious Glenn in the back of the army truck as she writes down coordinates on her hand with a marker so she knows where they're going. When walkers appear on the road, she watches as Abraham attacks them with a crowbar and says he's the luckiest person in the world. 

Later that day, Glenn wakes up and Tara tells him not to move as she offers him some water. He asks if while driving they passed a bus. She informs him she saw everyone dead and it's been three hours since they've passed the bus. Glenn says they need to go back, so the two of them bang on the window from the back of the truck so it can stop.

Abraham tells them that they can't stop because Eugene knows the cure, shocking them both. However, Tara follows Glenn as he leaves to keep searching for Maggie and explains that she wrote down every coordinate on her hand and she knows her way back. When Abraham and Glenn start fighting, Tara and Rosita tell them to stop as Eugene notices some walkers. The four of them run back towards the truck to help Eugene fight off walkers. 

With the army truck lost to stray bullets, Tara and Glenn walk off before they are followed by the others. As the five venture off, Abraham calls Tara a good person for helping Glenn but he believes that saving the world is more important. She says she's not a good person, and tells him to not lie to her about the real reason he's helping Eugene.

Tara walks with the group along the train tracks on their way to Terminus. Eugene tries to strike up a conversation with her, firstly by theorizing the dinosaurs could have been wiped out by the same virus that has wiped out civilization, before asking her what kind of gamer she was. While camping that night, Abraham questions Tara why is she helping Glenn and she confesses she is trying to make amends for doing something bad. The next day, Glenn comes upon another Terminus sign marked by Maggie, Bob and Sasha and sprints ahead as the rest of the group follow him. 

Later that day, the group comes upon a tower and Abraham insists they stop to rest. When a walker appears above in the tower and almost falls on top of Eugene, Tara is pushed out of the way by a protective Abraham and injures her knee. Nonetheless, she is still adamant in her support of Glenn. When the group comes upon a railway bridge in the mountainside, Abraham reluctantly parts company with Tara and Glenn, saying the risk is too high to Eugene and they will instead go around, telling them they'll likely be camped at the other side should they survive and make it through. 

Tara and Glenn enter the tunnel and find evidence of a fresh cave-in, as well as many trapped walkers. Glenn insists he needs to see the faces of the walkers to ensure none of them are Maggie and Tara helps. When the two set a diversion with a flashlight to sneak around the overwhelming swarm of walkers, Tara slips and gets stuck in the debris. Glenn, refusing to leave her, is forced to empty his handgun clip into the surrounding walkers. Out of bullets, the pair are then saved by Abraham, Eugene, Rosita, Maggie, 
Sasha
, and 
Bob
, who have now converged and joined forces.

That night, Tara is introduced to Maggie by Glenn, who tells his wife that he and Tara met on the road. An appreciative Maggie gives Tara a hug of thanks. With the newly formed group deciding on their next move, Tara agrees to go with Abraham to D.C. after they reach Terminus. The following day, Tara, now walking with a cane, arrives at Terminus with the others and is met by 
Mary
, who offers to get them settled and make them a plate of food.

The Day Will Come When You Won't Be

Tara is hallucinated by Rick in an idyllic dream with the rest of the group at Alexandria having dinner outside.



"
Swear
"


Having passed the two weeks of their supply run and after not finding anything worthy, Tara rejects Heath's proposal of heading back to Alexandria and insists they keep scavenging for ammo and medicine. While they look for supplies on a barricaded bridge blocked with cars and tarps, Tara tugs at a duffel bag lodged in a large sand pile, but the mound collapses, releasing a herd of walkers that were trapped inside, and surrounding her. Heath starts to shoot at walkers to save her before he runs out of bullets and becomes overrun. Tara tries to make her way over to help him, but she is shoved back and falls off the bridge to the river. She loses consciousness and is drifted to a nearby beach.

After being found and saved by 
Cyndie
, Tara pretends to be asleep and follows her into the woods where she discovers a bustling village inhabited by a large group of women. When the residents start shooting at her, Tara flees and takes one of the 
women
 down, knocking her out. Rachel steps in front of Tara and is about to shoot her when Cyndie again intervenes. More women emerge and surround Tara, holding her at gunpoint. The leader, 
Natania
, orders Cyndie to step away from Tara. She is then handcuffed inside a room to await interrogation. 

Natania walks into the room, joined by 
Kathy
 and Beatrice, and starts interrogating Tara about her background. Tara lies about her past and offers to leave their settlement. That night over dinner, Natania invites Tara and her friend to reside at their settlement to ensure they never reveal their location to anyone, and reveals that the men were all killed in a skirmish with another group, after which the women decided to relocate their home and stay hidden. Tara confesses that she comes from a community that killed a threatening group at an old satellite station. She suggests their groups band together. Natania agrees to send a guide with Tara to find Heath and meet with her community. 

The next day, Tara leaves the settlement with Kathy and Beatrice into the wood but soon realizes they are going to kill her. When a walker appears, she volunteers to kill it and seizes her opportunity to flee. As Beatrice catches up and holds her at gunpoint, Tara pleads that she has to get back to her friends, but Beatrice tells her it's too late, and assures her people are dead because the satellite station was only an outpost. She explains that her group tried to fight the Saviors too but lost, and the Saviors killed every man and boy over ten as punishment. 

When Cyndie helps Tara escape into the woods, she makes her swear to keep their settlement a secret and Tara agrees. Cyndie gives her a backpack with supplies nd offers to take her to where she last saw Heath. They eventually arrive at the bridge and Cyndie refuses to leave until Tara safely crosses. She makes her way across the bridge as Cyndie shoots down walkers from the top of a car. Tara looks for Heath and finds his broken glasses and some tire tracks in the dirt. She picks up a badge that says "PPP" and puts it in her pocket. She then travels towards Alexandria over the next following days, and on the way, she camps out in a gift shop and eats the food that Cyndie gave her. 

Sometime later, Tara arrives at Alexandria and is met by a broken Eugene. She is then informed of the recent events. Tara sits in the infirmary, despondent over the news of Denise's death as well as the deaths of Glenn and Abraham. Determined to seek revenge on the Saviors, Rosita asks Tara if she has any leads on guns or ammo. Tara keeps her word to Cyndie and tells Rosita that she didn't find anything during her scouting mission.



"
Hearts Still Beating
"


When Negan and the Saviors visit Alexandria, Tara approaches Olivia on the porch and hands her a canister of powdered lemonade as requested by Negan. She offers to take her place inside but Olivia declines, saying she promised Rick she would watch Judith.  

Later that day, Tara and the Alexandrians watch in horror as Negan disembowels Spencer and Olivia is shot in the face as punishment for Rosita trying to kill Negan. When Negan demands to know who made the bullet, Tara steps in and claims it was her but Eugene interjects and confesses it was him. 

Tara later accompanies the group as they reunite with the others at the Hilltop to prepare a plan to fight against the Saviors. When the group reunites, she ponders a smile. The whole group then walks towards the Barrington house.



"
Rock in the Road
"


Tara listens as Rick tries to convince Gregory to fight against the Saviors. She tells him he should do the right thing and step up, but he cuts her off. After they leave his office, Daryl reasons they might not need a large army and if they find the right supplies they could blow them up. Tara reminds him there are civilians inside the Sanctuary. Jesus tells the group it is time they met King 
Ezekiel
.

Tara accompanies the group to the 
Kingdom
, where they are reunited with Morgan and meet Ezekiel. They leave the next morning when Ezekiel refuses to fight. On their way back from the Kingdom, they encounter a blockade of cars on the highway set up by the Saviors. Tara helps to dismantle the explosives and Rosita takes some dynamite away from her, telling her she doesn't like the way it looks. 

As a herd approaches the highway, Tara, Carl, and Rosita work to block the onramp again until they are surrounded. They are eventually joined by Rick and Michonne and as they head back to Alexandria, the leftover dynamite explodes behind them. When they return, Aaron and Tobin inform them Gabriel disappeared with most of their food and weapons. Rick finds a note left from Gabriel and they head off to find him. Upon arriving at a junkyard, Tara and the group are held at gunpoint by a large group of strangers.



"
New Best Friends
"


Tara listens as Rick tries to make a deal with 
Jadis
, the leader of the junkyard group. When she refuses, Tara and the group are attacked but gain the upper hand until Gabriel defuses the situation by taking 
Tamiel
 hostage. She then watches through a tube as Rick is forced to fight 
a walker
 covered in metal armor and steel spikes. He later comes back to the group, injured but smiling, and tells them a deal has been made. 

Later that day, Tara suggests heading back to Alexandria to regroup but Rosita says they need to search for guns. Tara reasons that Rick and Aaron are injured and the people back home need food. Rosita says she will go on her own but Tara says they are sticking together. Rosita asks what her problem is and Tara says they aren't looking for a fight but getting ready for one. Rosita says it's always a fight and tells her to grow up. 

When Rick and Michonne discuss where they should look for guns, Rick says to Tara she's been out further than any of them and she can tell them where not to look, and she laughs it off nervously.



"
Say Yes
"


Tara arrives at Rosita's house to find her removing her stitches and says she was on her way to help her do that. After an awkward pause, Tara assures Rosita that it's going to work out. They have the numbers, they just need the weapons. Rosita asks if she knows where they can find that many guns but Tara doesn't answer. Rosita says she can't just wait. Tara again assures her they will find the guns and she needs to save her anger for the Saviors.

Later that day, Tara inspects the bracelet that Cyndie gave to her. She hands the bracelet to Judith as she debates the pros and cons of telling Rick about the guns at Oceanside. She's torn by her promise to keep its location a secret. When the group delivers the guns to the Scavengers, Tara looks defeated after Jadis says it is not enough and they need nearly twice as many. Upon returning to Alexandria, Tara tells Rick she needs to talk with him.



"
Something They Need
"


Tara reveals to Rick and the group that she encountered a group with guns while on her supply-run with Heath called 
Oceanside
 who had once fought the Saviors but lost, and are now in hiding. Realizing she needs to break her promise in order to acquire the guns and people to win the war against the Saviors, Tara leads the group of Alexandrians to the distant community. At Oceanside, Tara sneaks into Natania's home and holds her at gunpoint. 

Cyndie suddenly enters Natania's home and Tara calls her out. She is angry and hurt that Tara broke her promise, but she says she had no choice and explains that her group is taking their guns in order to fight the Saviors. She begs them to talk to Rick and join their resistance. Natania refuses and distracts Tara, giving Cyndie enough time to grab a hidden gun. Tara turns her gun towards Cyndie, and is tackled by Natania. As Cyndie holds her at gunpoint, Tara reveals that her own gun was never loaded. Natania asks for Cyndie's gun and she reluctantly complies.

As the other Oceansiders are taken captive outside by Rick and his group, Natania appears holding Tara at gunpoint. Cyndie tells her people that Rick's group wants to fight the Saviors. When Michonne warns Rick that walkers are approaching, Cyndie knocks Natania out, saving Tara's life again. The Alexandrians and the Oceansiders organize a combined defense that allows them to efficiently kill the walkers. 

When the group leaves with the guns later, Cyndie informs Tara that Natania has forbidden her community to fight the Saviors. She thanks Tara for what her group is doing. When the group returns to Alexandria late at night, Rosita opens the gate for them. She tells them they have a visitor. Rosita leads Rick's group to the Alexandria prison cell where 
Dwight
 sits behind bars. Rosita says that Dwight wants to help.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"


Tara furiously reprimands Dwight for murdering Denise. He replies that she was not his intended target. In response, Daryl slams Dwight against a wall and holds him at knifepoint. Tara tells Daryl to kill him, but Dwight tells Daryl that he served Negan for Sherry's sake and Sherry had saved Daryl, but she is gone now. Daryl reluctantly releases Dwight, believing his story. When Dwight leaves to head back to the Sanctuary, Tara and Daryl exchange glances.

The next day, Tara and the Alexandrians are left shocked as Eugene arrives with the Saviors and tells the group to surrender. When a reanimated Sasha attacks Negan and Carl uses the distraction to start shooting at the Scavengers and the Saviors, Tara joins the fight and helps Rosita after she is shot. After the Saviors and the Scavengers escape, Tara sits by Rosita's side as she recovers in the infirmary.

"
Mercy
"


As part of the Militia's plan to trap the Saviors in the Sanctuary, Tara and 
Carol
 stand watch on a bridge as they wait while the herd of walkers moves along the road below. When 
Daryl
 and 
Morgan
 meet up with them, Tara counts down to the herd's arrival and is upset as they arrive some minutes late. They vacate the road in haste and watch as the SUV they parked on the exit ramp explodes to attract the herd towards the mapped road.

While they await on a pedestrian overpass to track the bombs they planted for the herd to follow, the group spots a walker nearing the tripwire. Morgan stops the walker from tripping the explosive. On the road, a Savior caravan trips the wire and sets off an explosion. The herd approaches, drawn by the explosion. The group then parts away, with Tara leaving with Morgan. She then joins a group that prepares to attack the 
satellite station outpost
.



"
The Damned
"


Tara, Jesus, Morgan, and 
Diane
 prepare for a raid on the Satellite station. She claims they did it before and can do it again, but Jesus insists if a gun fires they won't get in. As the militia ventures inside, they use silenced pistols to put down Saviors. While they sweep the station, Tara and Jesus discover a Savior named Dean cowering in a closet, having seemingly peed himself in fear. He claims to be a worker from the Sanctuary forced from his family. Jesus decides to show mercy and let him live, but Tara is furious, desiring to kill all the Saviors out of revenge for Denise.

When they get distracted by the gunfire, Dean takes Jesus hostage, revealing his deception. Before he can shoot Tara, Jesus swiftly disarms him with his skills in martial arts. Regardless, he refuses to kill Dean, instead choosing to tie him up, much to Tara's disgust, who questions Jesus on Abraham, Glenn, and Denise. When they hear over the radio as the Saviors plan to retreat, Jesus leads the rest of the fighters to the back exit of the compound, intercepting around a dozen fleeing Saviors, including 
Alden
. Heavily outnumbered and outgunned, they surrender without a fight, but Tara angrily declares that even if Maggie listens to Jesus' reasoning, Rick will listen to hers.



"
Monsters
"


While traveling towards Hilltop, Tara watches over the captured Saviors while riding on the back of a pickup truck with 
Eduardo
. He tells Tara that Maggie will know what to do with them. Tara acknowledges him, believing she will kill them for what they've done. As the militia gets ambushed by walkers, she helps defend their prisoners, and watches as Morgan chases after Jared and his chain gang into the woods. Tara and Dianne arrive after Morgan and Jesus have their fight about the Savior's fate. Before Morgan leaves, she tells him that he is right about killing the Saviors. 

When the group arrives at Hilltop, Gregory immediately insists that the Saviors can't stay, but Maggie shuts him up and sends him away while she talks to Jesus. Tara says she agrees with Gregory that they shouldn't be allowed to stay, and Maggie notes that with families and children at the Hilltop, the arrangement would be dangerous. Jesus insists they can't kill those who surrendered, and makes plans to keep them under armed guard in two empty trailers.



"
The King, the Widow, and Rick
"


Upon returning to Alexandria, Tara tells Daryl that she understands why he spared Dwight and feels he made the right choice as Dwight is the only reason they've gotten so far. However, she is determined to kill Dwight when everything is over. Daryl suggests that they will kill him together and that they won't have to wait for the war to be over. While on their way to the Sanctuary, they crash into 
Zia
's vehicle killing her. They then encounter Michonne and Rosita, who reveal they are both heading to the Sanctuary as well and the group join forces.



"
Time for After
"


As the group discusses their plan, with Morgan having joined them, Rosita shows doubts about the plan, concerned about the workers inside the building and the plan going awry. Tara confronts her about her apparent change in attitude, and recounts how she had waited before telling Rick about Oceanside and their weapon cache, showing regret at the fact that she had not informed him earlier, which could have helped better their situation.

When Rosita leaves, Tara and Daryl continue their plan and Michonne insists on seeing it through. They drive the truck to the edge of the Sanctuary's perimeter as Morgan keeps watch. Several Saviors perched at the window are fired upon by Tara, Morgan and the lookouts as Daryl crashes the truck into the Sanctuary, breaching the walls and allowing the herd to pour in. Tara and Daryl retreat as the walkers begin making their way inside.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


Having returned to Alexandria, Tara helps Rosita unload some boxes. As she suggests that they take the air horn to direct the herd, Rosita with a smile on her face puts the heavy boxes on her arms. That night, Tara is part of the convoy that escapes Alexandria while the residents hide in the sewers. After killing all the saviors in a trap with the help of Dwight, they return to Alexandria and hide in the sewers with the rest of the residents where they would discover shortly after that Carl had been bitten by a walker and was suffering from the infection.



"
Honor
"


Tara remains in the sewers with the other Alexandrians as the Saviors' grenades continue to blow apart Alexandria above them. She listens as Dwight explains that the Saviors will soon run out of ammo and insists they stay put until the siege is over. After the explosions subside and the remaining Saviors leave, Tara says goodbye to Carl and she and the others prepare to head to the Hilltop for refuge.



"
Dead or Alive Or
"


Tara and the other Alexandrians evacuate through the woods towards the Hilltop. When the group comes across a walker in the forest, Tara moves in to deal with it, but allows it to cross over to Dwight, claiming that it escaped her grasp, although he dispatches it before the group heads forward. While the Alexandrians rest in the forest, Daryl and Rosita retrace their steps to cover their tracks as a vengeful Tara questions why Dwight is still alive. Daryl and Rosita agree that Dwight is still a valuable asset, with Rosita deciding to wait on dealing with him until they reach the Hilltop.

Tara, Daryl, and Rosita later look over a map at the different routes the Saviors can travel from the Sanctuary to the Hilltop, finding that most of their paths can be potentially dangerous. Dwight, however, points out that an alternate path, through a swamp is seldom used, due to the risks it poses against the Saviors. When Daryl agrees on going through the swamps, Tara tries voicing her opposition to the plan, and opts to stay behind to watch the group as Daryl gathers volunteers to assist with clearing out the swamp from walkers. 

As the rest of the Alexandrians wait at the bank, Tara spots a small group of walkers in the trees. She asks for a volunteer to help her clear them, before tossing a knife in Dwight's direction. When they are away from the main group, Dwight expresses his remorse for killing Denise, accepting that he may not be forgiven for his deed. After putting down the last walker, he turns to find Tara holding him at gunpoint. She is fixated on avenging Denise, and makes several attempts to shoot Dwight, chasing him through the forest until they stop at a clearing. 

When a Savior patrol approaches, they are forced to hide in the bushes where Tara continues to hold Dwight at gunpoint. She then turns her attention towards the patrol, who are inching closer to their position. In an effort to divert their attention away, Dwight makes his presence known, explaining that he survived the ambush near Alexandria and leads them away from the swamp. Tara is surprised by this and finds Rosita, having followed the pair. She asks why she didn't attempt to stop her, with Rosita explaining that she would have also pursued him to no end. 

Upon returning to the swamp, Daryl furiously berates Tara for allowing Dwight to leave and risking him giving away their group to the Saviors. Having seen Dwight's efforts to sway the Saviors away from their location, Tara is convinced that Dwight has changed for the better. Daryl remains unconvinced, but forgoes continuing the conversation any longer, leading the Alexandrians through the now-clear waters. Tara and the Alexandrians eventually arrive at the Hilltop gates, bearing the news of the town's downfall and the loss of Carl.



"
Do Not Send Us Astray
"


When the Saviors show up at the gates of Hilltop to attack, Tara and the militia members prepare themselves to defend the community. During the battle, Simon spots Tara and orders Dwight to hunt her down. Daryl sees Simon and Dwight sneaking up on Tara and shouts a warning, but is too late as Dwight shoots Tara in the arm with an arrow. She is removed from battle as the militia manages to drive the Saviors out.

The next day, as Hilltop cleans up in the aftermath of battle, Tara and Daryl discuss Dwight shooting her. She tells Daryl that she was with the Governor when they first met. Daryl references his brother and says he would be with the Saviors if he were still around. Tara has been vouching for Dwight since he saved their lives, 
"I saw him try and help us win,"
 she tells Daryl, but he refuses to accept her word and leaves.

That night when all the wounded in battle mysteriously turn into walkers and chaos unfolds inside the mansion, Tara sits on a bed surrounded by Enid, Rosita, and others. When Rick, Daryl, and others enter the room, Tara questions how this happened. Daryl tells her that the Saviors did something to their weapons and that everyone they cut up, got shot, they all turned. 
"Karma's a bitch",
 Tara says as she accepts her fate.



"
Still Gotta Mean Something
"


The next day after the attack, Tara meets with Daryl and she tells him she isn't sick and that Dwight shot her with a clean arrow. She reasons that Dwight shot her to save her life and probably couldn't break away to warn them about the coming attack though Daryl refuses to believe it. They disagree and Tara lets go of her vendetta against Dwight.



"
Wrath
"


When the Saviors approach Hilltop, Tara helps the residents evacuate but stays behind to fight. Alden and the other prisoners insist on helping her. Tara and the prisoners prepare to attack. To their surprise 
Cyndie
 and the 
Oceansiders
 ambush the Saviors with Molotov cocktails, preventing a battle. Tara smiles on as they finally join the battle.

After the war with the Saviors end, Tara and Rosita deliver supplies to the Sanctuary, where they greet 
Tanya
 and 
Frankie
 while Saviors are rebuilding their compound.

"
A New Beginning
"


Over the next year and a half that passed since the end of the war, the communities stablished safe routes to travel between the communities. One morning Tara is scouting one of the roads when Eugene radios her, informing her that a group will head to Washington D.C. to search for farming materials for the Sanctuary

While most of the group heads inside the Smithsonian to scavenge, Tara stays outside as a lookout along with Aaron, Jesus, and Alden. The group then leaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities. On the road, Tara and the others are informed by Daryl and Rosita that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Rick tells Tara, Gabriel, Aaron and Anne to head back to Alexandria and the rest will go to an alternate route and spend the night at the Sanctuary.



"
The Bridge
"


Having moved from Alexandria to the work camp along with several other residents, Tara is one of the lookouts posted in the crane in charge of watching over the perimeter of the construction site. One morning, she walks around with Anne and salutes Rick when she passes by his side.

In the present, Tara and members of the communities arrive nearby the nearly constructed bridge as Rick tries to lead a herd away from the other side. While everyone sprints towards to help him, Rick shoots at a box of dynamite and the bridge ignites and explodes as Tara and the rest can only watch in horror, assuming Rick to be dead.



"
Stradivarius
"


In the years following Rick's presumed death and after Michonne choose to isolate Alexandria from the rest of the communities, Tara moved to the Hilltop but not before stealing the community charter. When Maggie, along with 
Hershel
, left Hilltop to join 
Georgie's group
, Tara became a more prominent member of the community since Jesus wasn't interested in being charge despite having been elected as the new leader.

Six years later, Tara checks as residents tend to their crops. She heads inside the Barrington house to Maggie's old office and asks Jesus about any news on Maggie. He reveals she has sent another letter, where she admits to be happy. Tara then updates him on some minor problems at their community and congratulates him on being reelected as the leader. He reminds her he ran unopposed, but Tara suggests he should take Maggie's office and he refuses.

At night, Tara updates Jesus on Rosita's condition and asks what he was doing out there. Jesus confesses he was training Aaron while trying to get Alexandria on board with the fair. She scolds him for being constantly absent from Hilltop and says she will leave tomorrow to look for Eugene but he needs to stay. In the morning, Tara greets and hugs Daryl and Carol when they arrive with 
Henry
. As the rescue group gears up to go find Eugene, Jesus tells Tara he will go instead of her and next time he promises to stay, to which she agrees smiling.



"
Evolution
"


When Michonne and Siddiq arrive at Hilltop with a group of newcomers, Tara coldly greets Michonne and updates her on Eugene, Aaron, Daryl, and Rosita's situations. She then informs Magna's group that they'll have to wait for Jesus to return before deciding on their future, but they can stay until he gets back. 
Connie
 thanks her for everyone. At night, Tara takes Earl down to the jail where Henry sits in a cell as punishment for misbehavior.



"
Adaptation
"


Tara talks with Enid, Alden, 
D.J.
, and 
Marco
 to organize a search party for the group that went out to look for a missing Eugene since they haven't returned. 
Luke
 offers his help and goes out with Alden. When the original search group arrives back later that day, Tara looks in sadness at Jesus' corpse. Tammy tells Tara that the Hilltop will now look to her for leadership, reminding her that includes getting justice for Jesus. Tara affirms she understands. 

Shortly after, Tara, Daryl and Michonne interrogate the captured girl. She claims to not have a name and that her group were good people just trying to survive. Michonne asks if her people know about Hilltop but the girl begs to be left alone. Outside, Michonne says she's heading back to Alexandria and Tara tells her she's going to allow the new group to stay because it's what Jesus would have done. She then assists the funeral and puts the final nail in his coffin.



"
Omega
"


Tara leads 
Magna
 and her group in the search for Alden and Luke in the woods. They find a group of walkers feasting on their horses and kill them, while checking they aren't 
Whisperers
. Connie notices that the horses were cut open and skinned with knives. Tara realizes that 
Lydia
 lied about it just being her mother out there and decides they should go back to Hilltop until they find out what this is.

The next day, Tara watches from a guard post as Magna and 
Yumiko
 return to Hilltop. Yumiko apologizes to Tara for leaving and Tara tells her to talk to her next time. Suddenly, Yumiko spots a small group of Whisperers approaching Hilltop as guards grab Kelly to get her inside, while Connie hides in the cornfield. 

Tara calls out to Daryl and Magna below to join them on the guard post. In front of the gate, 
Alpha
 leads a group of Whisperers. She introduces herself and tells them she just wants her daughter back.  



"
Bounty
"


In a flashback, Tara and Jesus ride up to meet Carol, Ezekiel, and Jerry on a clearing in the woods to trade some medicine for sick people back in the Hilltop. She tells them that she has left Alexandria after not agreeing with Michonne's decisions and hands Ezekiel the community charter before leaving.

In the present, Tara listens as Alpha offers trading Alden and Luke for her captive daughter. When the group discovers Lydia and Henry are missing, Tara helps look around the community for them. After Lydia is eventually found later that day, Tara watches from the gates as the hostage exchange is done successfully and the Whisperers leave. At night, Tara is informed by Daryl he will go search for Henry after discovering he has left to retrieve Lydia.



"
Chokepoint
"


Tara and Magna's group clear a tree from their path to the Kingdom to ensure the roads are cleared for Alden's convoy carrying the food and trade goods for the fair. Kelly lets Tara know she's worried about Connie, but she assures her she's fine with Daryl. When a small herd of walkers approaches the group later that day, they get in position and remind themselves to watch for the Whisperers. Suddenly, the Highwaymen ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara after helping to take down the herd. They then escort them safely to the Kingdom. Upon arriving, Tara greets Carol and Ezekiel, and updates them on the recent events regarding the Whisperers. 



"
The Calm Before
"


Tara watches from the crowd as Ezekiel declares they've finally accomplished Rick, Carl, and Jesus' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. She then sees as Daryl, Michonne, and the convoy arrive. Tara is glad to see the group together again, but spots Lydia among them. 
"The plan was to bring Henry…just Henry"
 she says angrily to Daryl.

When the communities leaders reunite inside the theater, Tara listens as Michonne says she's finally ready for Alexandria to help out. 
"We're here now,"
 she says. Gabriel announces Alexandria is willing to grant asylum to Lydia, but Tara warns if her mother retaliates it'll be against Hilltop. Michonne reminds her that none of them were trusted when they were first introduced to Rick's group, and Tara relents.

They all agree to send some of their own to Hilltop to guard against any potential attacks from the Whisperers and Michonne decides to re-establish the charter, establishing that an attack against Hilltop counts as an attack against all of them. Ezekiel then retrieves the original charter as Tara and Michonne finally make up. They all sign the charter, and Michonne tells Gabriel he should sign for Alexandria as the head of the council.

Later that day, Tara walks with a group who is going to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. She decides to stay instead and leave later with another escort and then fist bumps her companions as they leave for the woods. While talking with Gabriel and Rachel about looking for areas for the residents to train in case of a fight, Gabriel tells her he thinks she's a good leader and she knows it. Tara smiles and then goes to gear up. 

At some point later that day, Tara is somehow among the residents kidnapped by Alpha and taken away to a barn in the woods where they are about to be attacked by the Whisperers but are found by Ozzy, Alek, and D.J., giving the group a chance to fight back. During the fight, Tara manages to take down a Whisperer. In the middle of the chaos, Alpha arrives and the group is subdued. She then decapitates everyone as Siddiq is forced to watch, only leaving him alive as a witness. Tara's decapitated head is later put by Alpha on one of the several pikes used for the Whisperers' border.

The next day, Daryl, Michonne, Carol, Siddiq, and Yumiko find the border and watch in horror at the victims, a reanimated Tara being among them. They then put down their zombified heads to properly rest. When the group returns to the Kingdom, Siddiq delivers the tragic news and narrates how Tara and the others fought together as a family in their last moments. He finishes the story by encouraging everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.
