Overview


Andrea is strong, cautious, and brave. She was extremely protective of her younger sister before her death. Never one to shy away from a challenge or a fight. Andrea is stubborn, opinionated and first and foremost interested in keeping herself and those she cares about most out of harms way. Her closeness to Amy is what directly influences her into becoming suicidal around the end of season one and possibly her reason to punish 
Dale Horvath
, as she blames him for not letting her die in the way she wanted to and continuing to make her live in the cruel post-apocalyptic world.

During season two, she begins to become more independent, even considering leaving the group, and wanting to keep the gun her father gave her, despite Dale's disapproval due to her lack of gun knowledge and brief suicidal streak. However, after adequate training with 
Shane Walsh
, she becomes quite efficient with firearms and became a strong protector for the group and is more than willing to protect the group from any danger. It is shown that Andrea looks up to Shane as a better leader for the group than Rick and follows him on many crucial decisions such as abandoning the search for Sophia and killing the walkers in Hershel's barn. Her new attitude causes her to neglect helping around the farm in favor of sitting on Dale's RV with a gun much of the time, earning her the ire of the others for not doing her share of the farm's chores. By season three, she had been separated from the group after the farm was overrun, and was saved by 
Michonne Hawthorne
, with whom she forms a close bond.

After being brought to 
Woodbury
, she begins a relationship with 
the Governor
, which eventually ends when Andrea realizes that the Governor has a dark, sadistic nature. During the second half of the third season, it is shown that Andrea possesses strong leadership abilities as shown by a speech delivered to the Woodbury people following an attack by Rick and his group and does not see a war between the two groups as necessary. Andrea was shown to have become very bold as shown by her attempt to kill the Governor in order to protect her former group from certain death by the man but unfortunately failed, leading to her tragic demise.

Season 1


"
Guts
"


Inside a department store, Andrea points a gun in 
Rick
's face as he and 
Glenn
 enter. 
"We're dead because of you,"
 Andrea tells him, furious at his recklessness. Morales informs Rick that his gunshots have attracted numerous hordes of walkers. 
"You just rang the dinner bell,"
 Andrea seethes, as the group's attention turns to a crowd of walkers outside that are slamming themselves against the outer set of glass-pane doors, furiously trying to gain entry.

Andrea and the group questions Rick about what he was doing roaming around the streets of Atlanta aimlessly. He tries to explain he was trying to flag down a helicopter. Jacqui suggests that it was just a hallucination. 
"I saw it,"
 Rick insists forcefully. T-Dog tries to make radio contact with the camp, but fails to get a signal, wondering if they might have better luck on higher ground. Suddenly, muffled gunshots are heard. 
"Oh god, is that Dixon?"
 Andrea says in disbelief, as they all leave to investigate.

On the roof, Rick and the group find Merle firing at walkers with a rifle. T-Dog chastises him for wasting bullets and attracting more walkers. Merle scoffs at him and calls him a slur, which sets off a fight between the two. Andrea screams at him to stop as Merle beats T-Dog and presses a handgun to his forehead. Rick intervenes, hitting Merle with the butt of the rifle and handcuffing him to a pipe.

Morales informs Rick there's no refugee center and that they are part of a larger group of survivors staying outside the city, but T-Dog can't reach them on the radio. 
"We're on our own,"
 Rick says. With the streets no longer safe, Rick suggests they try to escape underground. Jacqui says that the building might have access to the sewers, prompting Andrea and the group to head back downstairs to the basement. In the basement, Glenn concocts a plan and sends Andrea and Rick to watch the storefront while he and Morales head down the sewer.

At the front of the store, Andrea and Rick keep watch. 
"Sorry for the gun in your face,"
 she says to Rick, who claims he's helping the group escape to earn their trust and understands what Andrea did, but he tells her: 
"Next time, take the safety off." 
She says her gun
 
was a gift and she doesn't know how to use one. 
"We may have occasion to use it," 
Rick tells her. A while later, Andrea spots a necklace with a mermaid pendant. Rick encourages her to take it, insisting shoplifting rules don't apply anymore. Andrea pockets the necklace, when the walkers break through the exterior glass doors and begin pounding on the interior set. Glenn, Morales, and Jacqui arrive to report that the sewer is not an option. Andrea and the group heads to the roof.

On the roof, Rick spots a cube van at a nearby construction site. The group discusses the difficulty of moving past the walkers undetected. 
"They smell dead. We don't. It's pretty distinct,"
 Andrea says. Rick latches onto the concept of scent and how the dead use it to differentiate between themselves and the living. A while later, Rick and Morales collect a dead walker from the alley. Inside, Rick acknowledges the walker's lost humanity and then begins hacking the dead body to pieces with an axe. Andrea then helps smear the guts onto Rick and Glenn. 

Andrea, T-Dog, Morales, and Jacqui race to the roof to follow Rick and Glenn with a pair of binoculars as T-Dog tries again to radio the others. Suddenly, Andrea and the rest watch as rain begins to fall rather heavily and washes the guts' smell off of them. Rick and Glenn fight the walkers and manage to get inside the cube van. On the roof, Andrea and the group worries that they're being left behind but celebrate as Rick drives back for them.

Andrea and the group grab their bags and rushes from the rooftop toward the loading dock, with no concern for unlocking Merle's handcuffs. They manage to get inside the van as the walkers break into the store. Rick drives away from the city as the group catches their breath. They look around at one another and a guilt-ridden T-Dog admits to the others he dropped the key, leaving Merle trapped on the roof, still handcuffed to a pipe. Andrea then asks Rick, 
"Where's Glenn?"




"
Tell It to the Frogs
"


Andrea and Amy reunite once she returns to the camp. When 
Carl Grimes
 and 
Sophia Peletier
 find a zombie, they scream, prompting the adults to rush to them and killing it. Andrea and Amy watch in disgust as the zombie's head is separated from its body. Later, she is doing laundry with her sister, Jacqui and 
Carol Peletier
. As the women share what they miss most, she admits she misses her vibrator, prompting the women to break out in laughter. 
Ed Peletier
 walks over to the women in curiosity and tells the women they should be working and not laughing. Sick of Ed's attitude, she begins to stand up for herself and the others, tossing him his laundry saying that if he doesn't like it, he can do it. Ed throws the laundry back at her and responds that he won't smack her just because she's "some college educated coos". With heated tensions, Carol and Amy try to separate the two, which results Carol in being slapped and 
Shane Walsh
 attacking Ed in a fit of rage.

Vatos

The next day, Andrea is fishing with Amy, recollecting memories they had with their father while fishing, and how he raised them differently because he knew they would be special and different. Later, she returns to camp with a bunch of fish and they all have a nice dinner at night. Dale asks Andrea to back him up on the watch thing, but she disagrees. Prior to the dinner, she is in Dale's RV looking for wrapping paper to wrap the mermaid necklace for Amy, since it is her birthday soon. Unfortunately, zombies attack the camp, killing several people, including Amy, which leaves Andrea very, very distraught as Amy dies in her arms.



"
Wildfire
"


A deeply disturbed Andrea hovers over her sister's body for countless hours, waiting anxiously for her to turn into one of the undead and hardly ever keeping her eyes off her. She pays little attention to most of the people around, refusing to be distracted. She even resorts to pointing a gun at Rick when he comes near her and tries to get her focus off of Amy. Dale at the end of the day tries to comfort her by telling about his wife's death, to which she opens up shortly afterward. Andrea witnesses Amy's transformation finally, and after a moment of holding her, shoots her in the side of the head.



"
TS-19
"


Along with the rest of the survivors, Andrea finds herself in the CDC. She is in a deep state of depression since Amy's death, and tells Dale that, despite the idea that they can start a new life, there's nothing left for her to live for. When the building's energy resources begin to run low, a countdown is initiated. 
Dr. Edwin Jenner
, the sole doctor to remain at the building, explains it as the process of "decontamination", and that the building is sealed shut and there is no way out. Andrea, devastated by the fact that she has lost everything, decides to remain in the building even when Dr. Jenner unlocks the door of the basement to allow the other survivors a chance to escape. Jacqui, Dr. Jenner, and Andrea have decided on their fates, until Dale remains in a way to convince Andrea not to. Both Dale and Andrea decide to stay momentarily, until the dying seconds. Just before the C.D.C. building explodes as the process of decontamination, both Dale and Andrea escape the building and find cover behind sandbags. Surviving the self-destruction of the C.D.C. building, they reunite with the other survivors and drive off.

"
What Lies Ahead
"


Following their escape from the CDC, Andrea begins punishing Dale for guilting her into leaving the CDC, effectively robbing her of making her own choice. Stopped on the highway, Andrea is caught off-guard when a herd approaches, and is forced to seek refuge in the RV bathroom. As a walker shuffles into the RV, Andrea tries to re-assemble her pistol in haste, causing enough noise to alert the walker. Dale's quick thinking gives Andrea the means to defend herself, and she plunges a screwdriver through her assailant's head as it lunges at her.

Andrea wanted to use the pistol to dispatch the walker instead of a silent weapon, and a gunshot would have alerted the rest of the herd. Dale, Rick, and Shane believe it is in the best interest of the group to only allow those who have been properly trained to use firearms. This makes Andrea even angrier with Dale. In searching for Sophia, the group is drawn to a church. There, Andrea overhears Shane and Lori's discussion and Shane agrees to leave when the chance comes. After, Andrea confronts Shane and asks to go with him.



"
Bloodletting
"


The survivors continue searching for Sophia. Andrea is attacked by a walker, but she is saved by Maggie on horseback. Back at the RV, there is still tension between her and Dale, even as he asks for her forgiveness for some of the decisions he has made on her behalf. He reluctantly returns her father's pistol to Andrea, but asks that she doesn't make him regret it.



"
Save the Last One
"


Dale, Carol, 
Daryl Dixon
, and Andrea spend the night on the highway in the RV, though Carol's sobbing keeps everyone awake. Andrea decides to join Daryl in a midnight search for Sophia. During their walk in the woods they discuss Sophia's chances, and come across a suicide victim by hanging. Though the suicide worked, it didn't prevent reanimation and the man now hangs helplessly in the tree as a walker. Daryl asks Andrea if she wishes to continue on living. She bargains with Daryl that she will answer his question if he puts the suspended walker out of its misery. Her response to Daryl's question is "I don’t know if I want to live... or if I have to, or if it’s just a habit."



"
Cherokee Rose
"


Andrea and the other survivors who remained on the highway arrive the next morning at the farm of 
Hershel Greene
, where Carl was taken after being shot. Though Andrea plays a minor role in this episode, she is part of the most notable scene with the survivors attempting to retrieve the 'swimmer' from the bottom of one of the five wells on Hershel's property. As Glenn is lowered into the well to lasso the water-logged walker, the pump breaks. As Andrea and the other survivors struggle to re-stabilize the rope, Glenn dangles precariously within the walker's grasp. Once this near-tragedy is averted, Andrea, along with the other survivors, attempt to hoist the walker out of the well before killing it to avoid contaminating the well. However, the walker's body is too badly deteriorated and strained by the weight of the extra water it has absorbed to withstand the stress of being pulled from the well. Its body is ripped in half as it crosses the threshold, and the bottom half falls back into the well. Andrea and the other survivors are disgusted, moreover frustrated that the well is now contaminated despite their best efforts.



"
Chupacabra
"


Andrea begins to transition from a depressed and unstable personality into a stronger and more dependable survivor, showing a desire to help the group and concern for others when she takes leadership of one of the sub-groups that leaves the farm to search for Sophia, and later elects to take watch on top of the RV. She has increased her gun-wielding prowess and believes that she is now able to dispatch threats from a distance with proficiency. She is excited upon spotting a lone walker approach the farm, as it presents an opportunity for her to prove herself to the others. Though Rick and the other survivors advise her not to shoot, Andrea fires on the walker from atop the RV but learns afterward that it was actually Daryl, limping back from his difficult ordeal in the woods. Luckily for Daryl, her aim is not quite spot-on just yet, as the bullet only grazes his head. Though Andrea is mortified that she almost killed Daryl, it may prove to be only a minor setback to her growing confidence.



"
Secrets
"


Andrea apologizes to Daryl for shooting him and he forgives her. A short time later, Andrea continues to sharpen her shooting skills under Shane's tutelage, but has difficulty hitting a moving target. Adding yet another layer of difficulty, Shane distracts and agitates Andrea, trying to simulate a live environment. He eventually goes too far when he brings up Amy, but the two reconcile when Shane asks her to go with him on a dangerous mission to check out a lead on Sophia. Andrea follows Shane into a house to discover charred and rotting corpses and no signs of Sophia. A group of walkers are alerted to their presence, and the two are forced to bolt for the exit. More walkers have collected in the street and are blocking their escape. Shane clears out the walkers around their car, and assigns Andrea to cover the street. She can't seem to shoot any of her targets in the head, and walkers continue to advance on her. Shane picks off the nearest one and then lowers his weapon indicating that it's sink or swim time. As a walker gets almost within arm's length, She blasts a hole in its head before it touches her, and she becomes much more precise, nailing all head shots thereafter. Andrea walks towards the car but stops to take aim at the next wave of walkers closing in and the scene ends, but it is assumed that she dispatches them flawlessly. On the way back, Andrea grabs Shane's crotch. Shane stops the car and says "Come on then" and the two have sex.



"
Pretty Much Dead Already
"


After the discussion regarding the walkers in the barn, Andrea prepares herself in the RV to guard the barn as Shane requested. Dale tries to warn Andrea about Shane, but Andrea supports Shane's sentiments, adding "He's not a victim." After Andrea leaves, Dale makes an attempt to hide the group's firearms, fearing Shane's pending aggressive reaction to the news of the barn walkers. Rick, Hershel, and 
Jimmy
 return with two fresh walkers who had been trapped in the swamp. Before they can load them into the barn with the others, Shane goes over the edge, declaring that he's had 'enough.' After killing the walker that Hershel was escorting, Shane proceeds to break open the barn doors, releasing the horror within. Andrea quickly takes a spot next to Shane, forming a firing line to repel the walker onslaught. Andrea, Shane, Glenn, 
T-Dog
, and Daryl gun down the walkers as they emerge, until zombified Sophia appears, stunning all except for Rick, who steps up to dispatch her.

Emotions run high in the aftermath of the 
barn walker massacre
. 
Beth Greene
 goes over to her mother 
Annette
 to mourn, but Annette is not dead and attacks Beth. Andrea drives a scythe through the zombified Annette's head to end the struggle. After the funeral, Andrea and 
T-Dog
 pile corpses into Otis's truck, saying that Shane did what needed to be done. Dale protests, suggesting that a new problem with Hershel was created in the wake of resolving the safety concern of the barn walkers. Andrea, T-Dog, and Shane all burn the barn walkers behind the barn.



"
Triggerfinger
"


At the farmhouse, everyone is preparing for dinner when Shane realizes Lori is missing. Andrea says that Lori had asked her to watch Carl, and they conclude that she had left in search of Rick and Hershel. Shane goes after Lori. After retrieving her, Shane talks to Lori about their affair and that his feelings remain strong, but doesn't mention the sexual encounter with Andrea. The next morning, Shane, Andrea and Daryl are preparing to go after Rick when Hershel's car approaches and Rick's crew piles out. Andrea asks what they should do with 
Randall
, a survivor whom Rick, Hershel, and Glenn rescued the night before. Rick discusses releasing him away from the farm when he heals. Shane sees Randall as a threat and wants to kill him outright. Outside, Andrea tells Shane she agrees with him about Randall and about several other things, but says that his presentation leaves something to be desired. Shane says that he regrets not leaving with her when they had the chance.



"
18 Miles Out
"


Andrea is first shown on top of Dale's RV, keeping watch. Lori asks if she has seen Hershel or Maggie anywhere, and told her to get them immediately. Maggie scolds Beth for thinking about suicide as Lori and Andrea listen from nearby. Andrea mentions that Lori shouldn't have taken the knife away from Beth, and that Beth needs to make her own choice. Lori is shocked by the notion, commenting on Andrea's own suicidal situation, showing that she resents Andrea for not helping with the chores. Andrea says that she helps keep the camp safe, which is more important than laundry, and also resents Lori for having been so lucky to retain her family through the apocalypse, noting that suicide is a viable option for others who have not been so fortunate. Andrea leaves the conversation with Lori and offers to relieve Maggie on keeping an eye on Beth. Andrea advises Beth on how to deal with the pain, but also leaves the door open for her to make her own decision, believing that she will come around and not attempt to kill herself. Unguarded, Beth locks herself in the bathroom and attempts suicide with shards from the smashed mirror. Andrea runs to the farmhouse after Beth's attempted suicide. Lori reports that Beth didn't cut herself deeply. Andrea is happy to hear the news, but Maggie believes that Andrea's gamble was reckless, and tells her off.



"
Judge, Jury, Executioner
"


Dale asks Andrea to guard Randall so that his efforts to change the minds of the camp are not found to be in vain, and if she thinks Randall should be executed, arguing that despite the state of the world, keeping their humanity is a choice. Andrea reluctantly agrees to keep watch on Randall. Shane approaches the shed and asks Andrea if she would stop him if he were to try to shoot Randall. She says that she would, remarking that she had a great teacher. Shane shares his suspicion that Rick won't be able to go through with the execution. Later, the group gathers in the house. Rick asks for everyone to share opinions. Dale believes that they should give Randall a chance to prove himself, but everyone disagrees and sees Randall as a much greater potential threat than asset. Dale believes that even if he doesn't deserve a chance to become a part of the camp, that he doesn't deserve to die for a crime he may never commit. Andrea is the only one who eventually comes over to Dale's side, and says that they should find another way to deal with Randall. After Carl interrupts the execution, Dale investigates a strange sound in the field and is attacked by a walker. Daryl comes to Dale's rescue, but not before he is mortally wounded. The group is horrified to discover Dale's condition, and Andrea notes that he is suffering that someone should do something. Daryl eventually puts him down.



"
Better Angels
"


A scene running alongside Dale's funeral shows Shane, Daryl, Andrea, and T-Dog hunting down walkers. Hershel permits all but Shane to move into his house. Rick plans for himself and Daryl to bring Randall out to a nearby town and leave him there. Rick tells Andrea to help Hershel watch over the farm while they are gone. Andrea asks, “You want me to babysit Shane?” Rick says yes, because she is close to Shane.

Later, Andrea and Glenn are working on Dale’s RV. Glenn cries because he misses Dale, and is ashamed that he did not agree with him earlier, as Andrea did. Andrea comforts him and tells him Dale knew that Glenn did not really want Randall to be killed. They fix the RV. A thorough search of the farm shows no sign of Randall. Shane buries his gun and shouts to the group Randall escaped and is armed. Rick assembles Glenn and Daryl to go with him and Shane to track him down.



"
Beside the Dying Fire
"


When Carl shoots Shane, the herd travelling through the woods near the Greene farm is drawn to the sound of the gunshot. Andrea contemplates heading out to look for the missing survivors when Glenn and Daryl return, reporting that Randall had reanimated. Soon the group discovers that they have a much bigger problem - a large herd approaching. Lori is in a panic, not knowing where Carl is, while the rest of the group decides to get into vehicles and try to lure the herd away from the farm. T-Dog and Andrea pair up in Otis's truck, with Andrea firing at walkers from the passenger side while T-Dog drives. Andrea along with the other survivors rack up numerous kills before concluding that there are far too many walkers to manage, and their best chance is to flee. As Andrea and T-Dog make their way back to the farmhouse, Andrea gets out of the car, telling Lori and Beth to get in. Lori then tells Andrea to go get Carol, who is cornered by two walkers.

As Andrea manages to take care of the immediate threat to Carol, a walker looms dangerously close. Carol warns Andrea just in time, but as the walker is dispatched from point-blank, the weight and momentum of the dead corpse manages to knock Andrea over and land on her, temporarily pinning her. T-Dog, Lori and Beth are watching this from the car, and a walker's arm was blocking part of the window they were looking through, not allowing them to see that Andrea had indeed killed the walker, so they assume that she is dead, and they drive off. Andrea pushes the walker off of her, noticing that T-Dog, Lori, and Beth have drove away without her, and Carol has ran off. She then tries to flag Rick down as he, Carl and Hershel are fleeing from the farm, but they don't see her. She has no alternative but to run and shoot the numerous walkers pursuing her throughout the night. After what seems to be a long, exhaustive fight for survival lasting into the early morning hours, Andrea finally runs out of ammunition and energy, and is toppled by what may have been the last nearby walker of the group that had been pursuing her from the farm. As the walker is about to bite, it's head suddenly vanishes, leaving only a bloody stump. Bewildered and exhausted, Andrea looks up at her savior: a hooded figure toting a blood-stained katana blade and two pet walkers.

Andrea unsuccessfully tries to convince Michonne to leave her, saying she can take care of herself. Andrea, however, is successful at convincing Michonne that they need to move out now instead of waiting a few days like Michonne had originally planned due to the walkers that surround their location. Andrea, Michonne, and her two pet Walkers flee out of a back entrance of the game building.

 about the big event for the night, he avoids telling her.

She is told later by Merle that Philip wants to talk to her, and that it is urgent. Philip informs her that Michonne has broken into a private area and slayed a group of captive Walkers, and that she threatened Philip with her sword. When Andrea asks why he was keeping Walkers captive, Philip does not give her the answer just yet.

Going back to the room she shares with Michonne, Andrea asks an agitated Michonne why she did those things. "You're freaking me out," Andrea says, watching her hurriedly pack their things. Michonne continues to go on about how suspicious Woodbury really is, and Andrea says, "You are not making any sense." However, she decides to leave with her anyway.

As the pair of them are walking towards the gate to leave, Merle spots them and prevents them from going. He speaks briefly to a guard, and when Andrea tries to talk to him, he says, "I'm going to need you to back up." Confused, she turns to Michonne and asks if they can stay a little while longer. Andrea says that Woodbury is the refuge they have been seeking for 8 months, and that they should stay. Michonne gives her an ultimatum: either come with her, or stay in Woodbury without her. When Andrea hesitates, Michonne scoffs, "You just slowed me down anyway", and leaves her.

Later, while she is sitting at a bench and feeling hurt, Philip approaches Andrea. He comforts her, saying he has something in mind that will help blow off steam. That night, Andrea and the rest of Woodbury look on as Merle and Martinez face off in an arena of Walkers. The two men kick and punch each other, surrounded by Walkers, while Philip and the rest of Woodbury cheer.

Andrea becomes angry, accusing Philip of being "sick". Philip pulls her aside and says that they have pulled out the zombies' teeth, so that the men cannot be harmed and that it is just for fun. Philip says that he is teaching the people to be brave. Andrea still appears upset by this, as Merle defeats his opponent.

Carl, still believing that Andrea is dead, mentions her when listing the names of deceased female members of the group as possible names for the newborn baby.



"
Hounded
"


Andrea has been accepted as a member of Woodbury now, and wants to contribute in any way she can. She asks Philip if she can guard the wall, and he agrees.

Andrea meets 
Haley
 while guarding the wall, who reveals that she had lost her father and brother. When a walker approaches, she fails to kill it with her bow. Andrea jumps from the wall, knocking down the walker and stabbing it in the head.

Later, she is scolded by Philip, who does not want anyone leaving the wall. Andrea admits that she actually liked the arena fighting, but it bothered her to like them. Philip assures her nothing is wrong with liking a fight.

Sparks fly between the two later, and she ends up kissing him. They get more passionate later on, and she ends up having sex with him.



"
When the Dead Come Knocking
"


Andrea is invited by The Governor to witness Milton's conduction of an experiment on the ailing 
Michael Coleman
. Andrea questions if Milton has ever seen reanimation, to which he denies and explains that he was an only child and his parents had passed away while he was young. She later witnesses Michael reanimating and Milton repeats the experiment. The walker grips onto the bed and Milton believes that it was a positive response. Andrea believes it was just a random reanimation reaction. Milton unties Michael's restraints and repeats the experiment once more. The reanimated Michael does not hesitate and pounces on him, but before he can bite him, Andrea stabs it in the head while Milton, shaken, states that he will study his work and walks off.



"
Made to Suffer
"


Andrea informs The Governor that she wants to assist Milton in cremating Mr. Coleman; he remarks that "Woodbury's starting to grow on you." She is later seen with The Governor as he assembles a group to kill Rick and the other intruders. She volunteers to help the others, but The Governor insists that she stay behind; she nonetheless takes a gun and helps the guards shoot at Rick and the others, though she can't identify them due to the smoke. She spots 
Oscar
 and fires at him, but misses her shots.

Andrea later discovers The Governor, who had been mutilated by Michonne, and draws her gun at the latter, but doesn't fire. After approaching The Governor to comfort him, Andrea notices the tanks containing the severed heads of walkers and the corpse of Penny. She demands to know why he had them there. The Governor gives her a vague answer about the heads before brushing her next question about 
Penny
 off. Andrea is later seen at the gathering of Woodbury citizens when The Governor denounces Merle a traitor and is shocked when he reveals their prisoner to be Daryl.



"
The Suicide King
"


Andrea tries to talk Philip out of the deathmatch between Daryl and Merle, but to no avail. When the Woodbury survivors are distraught after the attack, Andrea manages to deliver a motivational speech, telling them that they have to persevere and assist in calming them down. Andrea also learns that her old group were the ones responsible for attacking Woodbury and causing the death of seven residents.



"
Home
"


The Governor visits Andrea, requesting her to take over leadership of Woodbury, insisting that he had "screwed up." Andrea later goes searching for Martinez and The Governor, who both went missing. Milton dodges her question, suggesting that The Governor may have went on a supply run. Andrea, however, doesn't believe his claims and walks off.



"
I Ain't a Judas
"


Andrea talks with The Governor, who tells her that the prison group attacked them first while he was simply attempting to negotiate. He tells her that they are "bloodthirsty." He also tells her that if she goes to the prison, she is to stay there. Andrea talks with Milton, and wants him to cover for her as she sneaks out to go the prison to make peace between Woodbury and the prison group. Milton and Andrea capture a walker in the woods to use as a deterrent. Andrea hacks both of the walker's arms off and then uses a rock to curb-stomp the walker's teeth out to prevent it from biting. Andrea and Milton are saved by 
Tyreese Williams
's 
group
 when another walker appears. Andrea arrives at the prison, learning of the fates of Shane, Lori, and T-Dog. Andrea tries to make peace, but Rick and the others make it clear that they want to retaliate against Woodbury and The Governor. Andrea learns that The Governor lied about who shot first from Rick, and Andrea's negotiation ends when Rick storms off after Andrea refuses to get them inside of Woodbury. Andrea accuses Michonne of poisoning the group, but Michonne argues that she was telling them the truth. While talking with Carol, Carol tells her to sleep with The Governor and give him the best night of his life, and then to kill him while his guard is down. Before departing, the group gives her a car and Rick hands her a handgun and a knife. She arrives back to Woodbury and sleeps with The Governor. While he is asleep, she stands over his bedside with a knife, contemplating Carol's plan. Andrea, however, puts the knife away and peers out of the window, unable to go through with the killing.



"
Arrow on the Doorpost
"


Andrea, along with Milton and Martinez arrive at an abandoned farm's barn as set by her, in order to get Rick and Philip to talk about the situation between the two groups. Andrea then, noticing the meeting began without her, strides inside the barn and tries to mediate the situation but is told by Rick that he knows about the raids, the heads and about Maggie.

Later, she tells the both of them to calm down after Philip demands Rick's surrender, and is then kicked out by The Governor. While waiting outside the barn, a small group of walkers approaches Andrea, Daryl, Hershel, Milton and Martinez, which causes Andrea, Daryl and Martinez to go kill them.

Andrea asks Hershel what Philip did to Maggie, which he answers saying "He's a sick man." Andrea is in despair and says she can't go back to Woodbury. Hershel agrees that she belongs at the prison, but warns her that once she leaves, she can't go back.

When Rick and Philip are done talking, all of them enter in their cars, causing Andrea to join Woodbury again. When they get back to Woodbury, Philip thanks her for setting up the meeting, but doesn't tell her about his plan of killing Michonne and the rest of the group. Andrea says she is glad she could help.



"
Prey
"


Milton tells Andrea about how he saw the torture room that Philip made for Michonne. He takes her to see it, and they look at all the tools that Philip plans to use. Milton tells her to go to the prison and tell them that they have to leave. She instead says that she must kill Philip. He walks in, and Andrea, in an overlooking room, points her gun through the shutters on the window. Milton forces her to put it down. Later, Martinez tells her to give him her gun, for "precautions". Andrea is later seen climbing over a wall that Tyreese and Sasha are guarding. Tyreese tries to stop her, only to have Andrea pull a knife on him. After a little negotiation, they allow her to leave. She starts a steady run, knowing that Philip will soon find out. She is running down an unknown road when she hears a car. She runs into the near woods and hides behind a tree. She is grabbed from behind by a walker, and two more approach her. She blocks them with her leg, and then kills them. She is next seen in an empty field when she hears the car again. She ducks down, but it's too late. Philip starts following her as she runs away. She goes through some debris, and Philip has to go around. She winds up at an abandoned warehouse. While inside, she accidentally tips over a bucket of tools, alerting Philip. She ends up finding a door. She opens it, finding many walkers on the stairwell inside. She closes the door, and turns around, seeing that she is cornered by Philip. She opens the door again and hides behind it, allowing the walkers to attack him. She finds a way out and leaves. She later arrives at the prison, trying to signal Rick, who is on guard in a watchtower. She is then grabbed and pulled down by Philip. Rick sees this out of the corner of his eye, and aims his rifle down there, only to come up empty. Philip somehow makes his way back. She is then seen, chained to a chair in the torture room.



"
Welcome to the Tombs
"


Andrea is seen still restrained to The Governor's torture chair. After Milton is beaten by The Governor, he is ordered to kill Andrea. When he refuses and attempts to kill The Governor instead, he is stopped and stabbed by The Governor and left to die but not before Milton leaves some pliers behind the chair. He tells Andrea about the pliers and orders her to stab him in the head once she frees herself. She tries to kick the pliers so she can grab them but she cannot in her boots. She takes off her boots to get the pliers more quickly as Milton slowly dies. After some struggle, she gets them and begins to free herself. As she begins to cut through her restraints, Milton reanimates. She manages to get one arm free as the now undead Milton stands up, ready to attack. She tries desperately to get the other arm free but is too late, for as she stands up, Milton bites her. She quickly dispatches Milton before falling to the floor. Later, Rick, Michonne, Daryl, Tyreese, and Sasha arrive at the torture room and find a pool of blood outside the door. They go in, find Milton's body, and find a bitten Andrea sitting against the wall. Michonne cries as she sees that Andrea has been bitten. Andrea requests that she commit suicide to avoid reanimation. Rick gives her his revolver and goes outside with Daryl. Michonne stays with her friend as she commits suicide, preventing reanimation and ending her life. Her body is later brought back to the prison for burial.

"
What We Become
"


Andrea appears in a hallucination where Michonne learns what she would have become if she had not saved Andrea when they first met. The hallucination starts out as a flashback, where Michonne and her pet walkers are walking through the woods, where she stumbles upon Andrea, who is fleeing. Andrea then falls to the ground and is being attacked by a walker, and Michonne becomes hesitant before deciding to let her die, walking away in silence. Andrea then screams in pain as she is devoured alive.

In another hallucination, Michonne returns to the location where Andrea was eaten alive and begins to scavenge through her belongings, taking a few of her possessions.

Trivia


Andrea is the first main character to be killed in a season finale, the second being 
Abraham Ford
, the third being 
Sasha Williams
, and the fourth being 
Rosita Espinosa
.


Andrea is the last character to die in 
Season 3
.


Andrea has had a sexual relationship with the main 
antagonist
 in both 
Season 2
 and 3 (
Shane Walsh
 and 
The Governor
). Coincidentally, she initiated a sexual relationship with the main antagonists in the sixth episodes of the two seasons: "
Secrets
" and "
Hounded
".


It was said by 
Laurie Holden
 that Andrea wasn't originally supposed to die in season 3, saying that Andrea was supposed to end up as the leader of 
Woodbury
's people, but it was changed three weeks before the shooting of the episode began. "...Everyone was shocked," Holden says in one of her interviews, "but this is 
The Walking Dead
. Nothing is certain anymore.", and it was 
Mazzara
's decision that no one supported. She said in one of her interviews that it was Mazarra's decision to kill her off for "shock value". She said, "There was somebody in charge for Season 3, who thought that it was 'cool'... to kill Andrea, because he wanted the world to go 
"Whatttt!?"
 You know? So it was for shock. It wasn't a plan, it wasn't supposed to happen. I found out the day before, and it could've been anybody. He just wanted to kill somebody big--umm... you know, for shock. But he never read the comic book, really. So, he did not realize what he was doing, and we had to shoot it. I mean--because... you know, when you're working on a film, you have to do it, so. It was very sad, because Andrea was supposed to be there for the very end. So, it was sad for me. It was sad for my 
The Walking Dead
 family. The man lost his job because of that decision. But it was never supposed to happen, and you know Andrea was supposed to end up with 
Rick
. So, this was one man's decision, who changed... 
history
. You know? But it wasn't something that anybody supported. Not any writers, no--you know? It wasn't supposed to happen."
[1]


Something similar happened to her actual death scene. The one that was aired was re-written by 
Scott Gimple
, while the original (which was written by Glen Mazzara) showed Andrea was bitten by 
Milton
 on the hand while still bound to the chair, screaming. In the end, 
Tyreese
 and Sasha were the ones who found her, and then the two freed Andrea from the chair. Sasha said that she would not leave her alone, but Andrea then insisted that Sasha should give her a gun. Sasha gave her what she wanted, and the two left Andrea to commit suicide. The shooting sound was then heard.


Laurie Holden said at the Philadelphia's Walker Stalker Con 2017 "I think the departure from book Andrea to the screen was a mistake. I mean, it's not like I couldn't pull it off. I think the whole stuff that they wrote about Andrea and the Governor was complete and utter nonsense. I did the best that I could to tell that narrative, and to justify it where Andrea kept her heart. I love Scott Gimple for giving me a gorgeous death with redemption so that you understood, and she wasn't a victim -- she died on her own terms. But I think that there was so much beautiful narrative that was lost and that she should have been there a long time, and been the leader that 
Robert Kirkman
 created in the comic book."


According to Holden during her Q&A panel at Chicago's Walker Stalker Con 2014, she was contracted for 8 seasons before the decision of killing Andrea off was brought to the table.


The only human that Andrea directly kills is herself.


Laurie Holden auditioned for the role of Rick's wife Lori, but was instead cast as Andrea.


Andrea is the third main character to predecease her comic counterpart, with the first being 
Dale Horvath
, the second being 
Lori Grimes
, the fourth being 
Carl Grimes
, the fifth being 
Jesus
, the sixth being 
Siddiq
, and the seventh being 
Beta
.


In the episode "
No Sanctuary
", a walker appears with longer blonde hair and a handcuff on one of its wrists, possibly acting as a callback to Andrea's manner of death and meant to resemble her.


"
What We Become
" marks the first time Andrea appears in some form after her death episode.

In total, Andrea only makes two total episode appearances after her death, the other episode being "
Rest in Peace
".


The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct
 implies her last name is "Harrison".

Her surname was officially confirmed to be such, during a special commercial during the 
series finale
 which starred 
Laurie Holden
 herself as Andrea, listing her full name as 
Andrea Harrison
.


This makes her one of the fourteen TV Series characters whose comic counterparts initially lacked a known last name. The others being 
Amy Harrison
, 
Dale Horvath
, 
Carol Peletier
, 
Sophia Peletier
, 
Tyreese Williams
, 
Eric Raleigh
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Lucille Smith
, 
Ezekiel Sutton
, 
Yumiko Okumura
, 
Luke Abrams
, 
Maxxine Mercer
, and 
Kayla Brand
.


Andrea is one of the seven main characters to be mentioned or appear (in hallucinations, flashbacks, or dreams) in every season after their death, the others being 
Tara Chambler
, 
Carl Grimes
, 
Enid
, 
Sasha Williams
, 
Glenn Rhee
, and 
Jesus
.

In Season 4, Andrea is first mentioned in the episode "
30 Days Without An Accident
" when Michonne attempts to locate the Governor, then again by the 
Governor
 in the episode "
Too Far Gone
" saying that their two groups cannot coexist with each other "not after Andrea," and later mentioned again in "
A
" when Michonne tells Carl that Andrea and his father helped to bring "[her] back."


In Season 5, Andrea is mentioned by Michonne in the episode "
Strangers
", telling Rick that she misses her.


In Season 6, Andrea is mentioned by Glenn to Enid in the episode "
No Way Out
".


In Season 7, Andrea is indirectly mentioned by Michonne to Rick in the episode "
Say Yes
".


In Season 8, Rick mentions her death to 
Morales
 in "
Monsters
" as one of the people he's lost over the years. Later, after the death of Carl, Michonne tells Rick that Andrea "brought [her] back" in the episode "
Still Gotta Mean Something
".


In Season 9, she is mentioned by Michonne in the episode "
What Comes After
".


In Season 10, Andrea appears in Michonne's hallucinations in the episode "
What We Become
".


In Season 11, Andrea appears in the form of flashbacks in the finale "
Rest in Peace
".


Andrea is the second main character to be bitten by a walker, the first being 
Hershel Greene
, the third being 
Bob Stookey
, the fourth being 
Tyreese Williams
, the fifth being 
Deanna Monroe
, the sixth being 
Carl Grimes
, and the seventh being 
Rosita Espinosa
.


Andrea is the second main character to die by being shot in the head, with the first being 
Dale Horvath
, the third being 
The Governor
, the fourth being 
Beth Greene
, the fifth being 
Carl Grimes
, and the sixth being 
Leah Shaw
.


A zombified Andrea appears alongside 
Milton Mamet
, 
Gareth
, and 
Rodney
 in a commercial created by Ryan Reynolds, advertising products such as DoorDash, Autodesk, Ring, and Deloitte.


All of Andrea's named human kills were zombified, except herself.


Andrea appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "Rest in Peace".

Additionally, Andrea is one of the many characters that can be heard speaking the words "We're the ones who live."
[2]


In an interview with Scott Gimple, it was revealed that Laurie Holden and several other former 
The Walking Dead
 stars were going to return for the final episode, but the idea was cut due to scheduling conflicts, and was reduced to single-recorded lines. "The speed we were moving at, it didn't seem we could do it visually in a way that seemed awesome," Gimple stated. "This was scheduled in a very tight way, and we would've had to schedule multiple shoots throughout the country to do it. Also, you know in older seasons of 
Survivor
, when they went directly from the last Tribal Council to the live event, and everybody looks completely different over the span of 30 seconds? I was a little worried about that too. Josh McDermitt's hair is blond right now. At the end of the day, looking at what we did editorially, I was pretty psyched, because it came through. And I suppose there's something to seeing the past."
