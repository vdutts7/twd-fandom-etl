Jenny and the other townspeople who escaped the Kingdom are led by Nabila to the safe house in the woods. Following the six-year time jump, Jenny has not been seen in the Kingdom nor was she among the Kingdom refugees to relocate to Hilltop or Alexandria, suggesting she either left the community or died due to unknown causes.

With the second, multi-year time jump in Season 9 , Jenny's fate remains unclear as all child extras from the communities were removed from casting due to the age differences (ie. their characters would be 5-6 years older in the show and their real-life ages would not match their characters' age and physical growth)."
