This
 was 
our home

 found 
this place

many of us

the Saviors came

Simon
 wanted what we had. He gave us our 
final warning
. Afterward, we ran and we tried to 
forget

your people
 came and asked us to 
fight
. We did because we couldn't forget. After

choice

Rick's rules aren't the only rules. You showed us the way

Overview
[
]


Cyndie is a compassionate, brave, idealistic, and helpful young woman. Unlike many in 
Oceanside
 who have become ruthless and brutal after the 
Saviors
 killed all the males above the age of 10, Cyndie is merciful towards outsiders and often goes against protocol to kill on sight. This is shown when she prevents 
Rachel
 and the other Oceansiders from killing 
Tara
, even helping her escape as long as she swears not to reveal Oceanside's location. Though she is hurt when Tara breaks this promise, Cyndie is among the few to consider joining 
Rick
's group in the fight against the Saviors, but is forbidden by her grandmother, 
Natania
, to do so.

After 
Enid
 kills Natania, Cyndie is forced to step up as the leader of Oceanside. Despite having killed her grandmother, Cyndie allows Enid along with 
Aaron
 to leave. However, it seems that she has taken on her grandmother's mindset and now refuses to join the war against the Saviors. Aaron stays at Oceanside and continues to try to convince her to join the fight. She initially ignores him, but later hears him out. He tells them that the Saviors are the reason they constantly live in fear and begs them to join the fight. During the final battle against the Saviors, it's revealed that Cyndie had listened to Aaron and finally decided to join the war.  Just as the Saviors arrive to slaughter the people at 
Hilltop
, Cyndie and the Oceansiders throw Molotov cocktails and save the town.

Now with the Saviors defeated, Cyndie lets go of the untrusting ways Oceanside carried for so long and integrated her community with the others. However, Cyndie and the other Oceansiders still harbor resentment towards the Saviors that had raided their home and killed all the men. After seeing 
Maggie
 execute 
Gregory
 for his crimes, Cyndie becomes inspired to get revenge on the Saviors that had killed their own. They kill 
Justin
, who murdered 
Beatrice
's husband and then 
Arat
 who killed Cyndie's brother with no remorse.

In 
Season 10
, Cyndie helps with the war against the 
Whisperers
 and allowed training on the Oceanside beaches, which is in contrast to back when the group was fighting the Saviors. Though Cyndie noticeably doesn't appear that often, when she does she helps out whenever she can.

In 
Season 11
, Cyndie is largely absent throughout the season due to setting out on an expedition at sea in the passing four months. But is known to have shared her leadership responsibilities with 
Rachel Ward
, during her extended absence. 



Pre-Apocalypse

Location Unknown
[

Nothing is known about Cyndie's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had a mother, brother, and was close with her 
grandmother
. At one point, she attended the county fair where she once fought with her brother on a canoe ride.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


Cyndie, her mother, younger brother, and grandmother survived the early stages of the outbreak and eventually formed a community of survivors situated at Hollowbranch where they enjoyed a peaceful existence. Unfortunately, her group would be discovered by a large, hostile 
organization of survivors
 led by 
Simon
 (who later became 
Negan Smith
's ruthless and sadistic second-in-command) and under his orders, Cyndie and her people were forced to gather and provide supplies for them under threat of death. Eventually, under her grandmother's orders, the group initiated a rebellion to fight back against their oppressors. However, due to being outgunned and outnumbered, their group was defeated and suffered many casualties, with Cyndie's mother being among them. As punishment for their defiance and to deter any further resistance, Simon had his group murder every male survivor above the age of 10. Despite her pleas, Cyndie's 11-year-old brother was personally and sadistically murdered by a woman named 
Arat
, earning Cyndie's hatred. 

Following this and being unwilling to continue working for Simon and his group, Cyndie and her group, consisting mainly of females now, fled their community and established a new home at a location called 
Oceanside
 and reestablished their community hidden from them. In order to prevent Simon and his group from finding them again, Natania ordered any survivor who happened upon the community to be immediately killed in order to maintain the secrecy of their new home.

"
Swear
"


Cyndie is walking along the shoreline with 
Rachel Ward
 when they come across a washed-up 
woman
. As Rachel insists on following protocol and killing her, Cyndie refuses and tells Rachel not to tell the others. She then drags Tara's body to the shade and leaves her with food and water. When Tara follows Cyndie back to Oceanside and is captured by the residents, Cyndie stops them from killing her and pleads with her 
grandmother
 to let Tara live, until they eventually agree.

That night, the women have supper and attempt to persuade Tara to stay with them in Oceanside. However, Tara wants to go back home to her 
girlfriend
 and the women offer to escort Tara back to the bridge where she last saw her companion 
Heath
. The next morning, Cyndie realizes 
Kathy
 and 
Beatrice
 are going to murder Tara instead and manages to save her before they can. She then catches up with Tara and helps her cross the bridge safely, after making her swear to keep their settlement a secret. Shortly after, Cyndie is brought back to Oceanside by Beatrice and Kathy.



"
Something They Need
"


When Tara leads her 
group
 back to Oceanside in the following weeks, Cyndie is angry and hurt that Tara broke her promise, but she says she had no choice and explains that her group is taking their guns in order to fight 
the Saviors
. She begs them to talk to 
Rick Grimes
, her leader, and join their resistance. When Rick and the other 
Alexandrians
 set off bombs on the outskirts of the community, Cyndie and Natania manage to subdue Tara and take her as their hostage. 

As Natania holds Tara at gunpoint and refuses to accept Rick's proposal, Cyndie realizes her grandmother is mistaken and knocks her out. Shortly after, she joins her fellow Oceansiders and the Survivors in a combined defense to help defend the community from walkers. After the deal is over, Cyndie informs Tara that she and the others have been forbidden by Natania from helping in the upcoming war and then thanks her for what her group is doing.

"
How It's Gotta Be
"


Cyndie is among the group of Oceansiders to inspect the truck brought to the community's outskirts by 
Aaron
 and 
Enid
. When Cyndie finds Natania's body after she is shot in the head by Enid, she begins to mourn her grandmother's death.



"
The Lost and the Plunderers
"


Having become the de-facto leader of Oceanside, Cyndie discusses with her fellow companions on whenever to kill Aaron and Enid to avenge Natania. After some convincing from Enid, she decides to let them live. However, Cyndie still refuses to join the fight against the Saviors, and warns them never to come back to their community.



"
Worth
"


Upon returning from fishing, Cyndie and some Oceansiders watch as an emaciated and weak Aaron kills a walker nearby before collapsing. Having been spotted in the area often by the women, Aaron is ignored except for Beatrice to tell him to find something to drink. Later that day, Cyndie and the residents find an exhausted Aaron, begging them to join the fight against the Saviors as they would otherwise continue to be fearful of the outside world.



"
Wrath
"


Just as the Saviors arrive at the 
Hilltop
 to slaughter the people inside, Cyndie, along with Rachel, Beatrice, and several Oceanside warriors, ambush the bandits with Molotov cocktails, effectively wiping them out and saving the town.

"
A New Beginning
"


During the year and a half that passed since the end of the war, Cyndie and her community had integrated themselves and start interacting with the other residents. When a group goes to the Smithsonian in 
Washington, D.C.
 to search for a covered wagon and farming equipment for the Sanctuary, Cyndie takes part in the scavenging mission. 

While looking around the stairs with members of the group, Cyndie sees an old canoe and tells 
Daryl
 it reminds her of when she would fight with her younger brother during canoe trips at the county fair. He comforts her and then they lift the canoe downstairs. Shortly after, the whole group reunites and gingerly uses ropes to drag an old covered wagon down the stairs and over the glass floor. The group then leaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities.

On the road, Cyndie and the others are informed by Daryl and Rosita that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Being forced to continue their journey through an alternate route, Cyndie witnesses as Kenneth is bitten in the arm by a walker and then kicked in the ribs by the horse. She then watches in sadness as Ken dies from his injuries and then is put down by a sobbing Maggie. That night in Hilltop, a saddened Cyndie attends Ken's funeral. When Maggie is attacked by a drunken Earl later that night, Cyndie and Alden manage to stop him from killing her.  

The next night, Cyndie watches from the crowd as Maggie gives a speech to the residents about the punishment in the community and then orders for Gregory to be executed by hanging to the shock of everyone. 



"
The Bridge
"


In the following weeks, Cyndie and her fellows Oceansiders became inspired by Maggie's actions and decided to seek their own revenge by killing the Saviors responsible for having executed all of the men and children from their group. 

Having moved from Oceanside to the work camp along with several other residents, Cyndie is part of the team of laborers working to build a bridge connecting the communities' trade routes. One morning, Enid stitches her injured hand in the camp's infirmary. When a group of walkers suddenly ambushed the lumber yard, Cyndie is among those to arrive in time to save Daryl, Jed, another Savior, and the injured Aaron. At night, Cyndie talks and laughs with others. 



"
Warning Signs
"


When the work camp is informed of Justin's death, Cyndie watches as the Saviors become furious and start accusing Daryl and Anne of being the culprits. Before a conflict can ensure between the different sides, Rick rides in the middle of the group with his gun drawn and warns everyone to back off.

Later that day, Cyndie and 
Maggie
 are patrolling the woods when they head to an abandoned house, which Cyndie claims to have lived there before Oceanside. As they deal with walkers that had been attracted by a metal banging on the roof, Rick, Daryl, and Rosita arrive in time to save them. Shortly after, they find an unconscious Beatrice in the woods who claims she was attacked from behind and that 
Arat
 is missing. Due to her being the last Savior involved in the Oceanside massacre, Arat is actually kidnapped and taken hostage for having killed Cyndie's brother.

That night, Cyndie and the Oceanside women are discovered by Daryl and Maggie before she can kill Arat. When they are asked for their motive for the murders, Cyndie emotionally recalls Arat was responsible for killing her brother without mercy and while smiling, and reveals they became inspired by Maggie's actions when she executed 
Gregory
. She then demands Arat to recall what she said when she killed her brother. 
"No exceptions,"
 Arat says. Both remember Glenn's death and walk away, leaving Cyndie to stab Arat through the back of the head with a 
spear
.



"
What Comes After
"


In a hallucination, Cyndie and members of the communities rush past an injured Rick on the bridge to kill the walkers and save him from the approaching herd before Rick manages to wake up.

In the present, Cyndie and members of the communities arrive nearby the nearly constructed bridge as Rick tries to lead a herd away from the other side. While everyone sprints towards to help him, Rick shoots at a box of dynamite and the bridge ignites and explodes as Cyndie and the rest can only watch in horror, assuming Rick to be dead.





Season 10
[

Content








In the years following Rick's presumed death, the ties that linked Oceanside with the rest of the communities were severed and Cyndie went on to lead her community on her own. When the Kingdom decided to make a fair and bring the communities back together, Cyndie rejected the offer to represent Oceanside during the big event due to additional responsibilities back home and instead sent Rachel as her representative. When the Whisperers murdered ten attendees to establish a border, Cyndie supported the idea of preparing for the impending war against their enemies and allowed the training to take place on the beach.



"
Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Cyndie and the Coalition form a militia in order to train the several residents of the communities to face any future treats. She takes part in a training exercise on the Oceanside beach. As Ezekiel and Jerry methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Cyndie and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat.

Later that day, Cyndie listens as Aaron radios Gabriel at Alexandria to warn him about the recently discovered Whisperer mask at the beach. She tries to convince the group is probably an old mask that just arrived due to the current, but Aaron is not convinced and Michonne leads a group to look for more signs of the Whisperers.

That night, Cyndie and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. The group runs out of water as a herd of walkers approaches the group. With their backs to the fire, the group prepares for a fight.

Cyndie and the group take their formations and start fighting off the herd. As they keep killing the walkers, Daryl tosses an axe to cut a tree down and have it fall to some walkers. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers.  



"
The World Before
"


When Michonne and a group arrive at Oceanside, Cyndie is informed about Siddiq's death and that Dante was an undercover Whisperer. Upon being asked about the arrival of newcomers, Rachel says that they had been welcoming people since before the satellite crashed. As Michonne suggests they use another system to vet newcomers, Cyndie witnesses as her fellow residents bring a man to the camp and accuse him of trying to steal one of the boats as well as being the Whisperer who was spying on them before. 

While the stranger begs he simply wants to get back to his family, Cyndie watches as the group debates what to do with him. When walkers suddenly invade, she helps take out the threat and secure the community. The next day, Cyndie accepts Michonne's deal with 
Virgil
 of bringing back weapons to pay off his debts in exchange for one of the boats.



"
A Certain Doom
"


Though unseen, Cyndie is among the survivors to escape the hospital in time and make it to the rendezvous point in the woods, where she reunites with her fellow survivors.

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Jennie
.
[2]


Cyndie was described as "Kind, with a world-weary toughness. Great with a weapon, but doesn't want to use them if she doesn't have to. She has survived the loss of most of her loved ones and makes an active choice to maintain a level of idealism and hope in the face of grief and trauma."


Cyndie and 
Rachel Ward
 are the youngest community leaders in the TV Series, only being in their late teens.

They along with 
Marlon
, 
Violet
, and 
Clementine
 are the youngest community leaders ever introduced in the 
The Walking Dead
 franchise.


Sydney Park was unable to film for the episode "
The Calm Before
" due to scheduling conflicts.

Had Cyndie appeared in this episode, Cyndie would've followed the ongoing trend of her appearing in the fifteenth episode of every season since her first appearance.


In "
A New Deal
", Cyndie is mentioned by 
Aaron
 as they plan to deliver aid to Oceanside and update them on events with the 
Commonwealth
, confirming that, before 
Lance Hornsby
's occupation of the community, she was still active in Oceanside and apparently sharing leadership with 
Rachel Ward
, despite not appearing on-screen since "
The World Before
".


Angela Kang
 believes that Cyndie's absence throughout the 
Final Season
 was due to being out on a sailing expedition to explore and scavenge.
[3]


According to 
The Walking Dead Universe Roleplaying Game
, after Cyndie left on her expedition, her boat was caught in a storm and sunk. She wandered west and ended up in the 
Atlanta
 area, joining a local group of survivors who inhabited three old tour boats on Lake Lanier. Unfortunately, everyone in the group (except Cyndie) was killed by a virulent disease.


Cyndie is the only character from Oceanside, to not make an appearance in the 
Final Season
.


Cyndie appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".


Cyndie is one of eight characters introduced in 
Season 7
 that are confirmed to be alive, the others being 
Ezekiel Sutton
, 
Jerry
, 
Dianne
, 
Nabila
, 
Theresa
, 
Douglas
, and 
Rachel Ward
.
