Overview
[
]


After 
Rick
's group attacks the 
Satellite Outpost
, Primo is one of the last surviving 
Saviors
. He's somewhat foolish, trying to make an escape in the wide open on a loud motorcycle, which causes him to be shot almost instantly. He spitefully tells Rick to shoot him like he did everyone else, but is stopped when 
Paula
 tells Rick they have captured 
Maggie
 and 
Carol
. Primo is shown to be unquestionably loyal to 
Negan
. Upon finding out the remaining Saviors are dead, Primo tells Rick that he is Negan, which prompts Rick to shoot him without hesitation. For a short time, Rick and the group genuinely believe Primo was Negan until they meet the real Negan.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Primo's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he may had some medical experience.
[1]




Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Primo somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as the Satellite outpost medic.  

Primo aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 6
[
]


"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"
[
]


Several hours after the pre-dawn raid led by 
Rick Grimes
 on the 
Savior
 outpost, Primo tries to escape on a motorcycle, which 
Daryl Dixon
 recognizes as his own. 
Rosita Espinosa
 shoots Primo off the bike and Daryl tackles him as he tries to flee and beats him into submission. Daryl demands to know where the Primo got the bike. As Rick holds a gun to the Primo's head, a 
woman
 speaks through the man's walkie-talkie, revealing she has 
Carol
 and 
Maggie
 hostages.



"
The Same Boat
"
[
]


Primo remains captured by Rick's group for several hours and his release is negotiated for Carol and Maggie's release from the Saviors even though Paula, the woman on the radio with Rick, denies the offer. Once Rick's group arrives at the Savior rendezvous point with Primo in tow, Carol and Maggie reveal that they had killed their captors. Realizing he is not useful anymore and has no escape from the situation, Primo tells Rick he is 
Negan
. In response, Rick unmercifully apologizes and then executes Primo in front of the others without hesitation.

Rick Grimes


After his fellow group members are killed by Maggie and Carol, Rick vigorously questions Primo about Negan. Knowing that he is going to be killed regardless if he talks, Primo instead tells Rick he is Negan and that there is a "whole world of fun" they should talk about. 

Rick apologizes unmercifully and then immediately shoots Primo in the forehead.
