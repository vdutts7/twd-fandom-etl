Overview


Duncan is a strong and hulking man who may come off as intimidating, when in reality he is caring and loyal to his friends. He acts as the muscle for the group since his strength and large stature allows him to carry and open things a normal person would be unable too, earning him the nickname "Sasquatch" by 
Negan
. He is very loyal to 
Maggie
 and obeys any orders he is given even if the order can be seen as immoral, such as stopping 
Alden
 from trying to save 
Gage
. After he is badly wounded by the 
Reapers
, he is mercifully put down by a greatly upset Maggie, with his final wish being to get 
Agatha
 home.



Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Duncan's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse


Season 11


"
Acheron: Part I
"


Upon Maggie and her group's return to Alexandria after their mission at 
Fort Connors
, she is overjoyed to see that Duncan, along with 
Agatha
 and 
Frost
, are alive and well. He playfully greets young 
Hershel
 and hoists him on his shoulders as the group talks. Later during a meeting, Maggie explains that Duncan, Agatha, and Frost were separated and believed to have been killed after 
Reapers
 attacked their 
village
. Duncan and his fellow Wardens agree to accompany Maggie and a group of Alexandrians to Meridian to take out the Reapers and secure the food and water supplies to feed everyone in Alexandria.

Part of a group consisting of Maggie, Daryl, 
Alden
, Cole, Elijah, 
Gage
, 
Negan
, Agatha, Frost, 
Roy
, and 
Gabriel
, the survivors utilize Negan's familiarity with the 
D.C.
 area to travel to Meridian. Due to the heavy rain storm, the survivors are forced to head into the 
subway tunnels
 to complete the journey. While in the tunnels, they come across hundreds of body bags, many containing walkers in them. At some point while dispatching the body bag walkers, 
Gage
 and 
Roy
 go missing, along with the group's ammo and supplies. Shortly after this realization, a large group of walkers appear, forcing the other survivors to move forward in the tunnel without being able to search for Gage or Roy. He is able to make it into a subway car before the walkers are able to catch up with his group.



"
Acheron: Part II
"


Duncan and the rest of the Meridian mission survivors make their way through the subway tunnels and successfully fight their way through the undead to safety, despite losing 
Gage
, who was killed after running away from the group and becoming separated. With the storm subsided, Duncan and the rest of the group traverse down a road when suddenly 
Roy
 is shot and killed and a flying knife severs Cole's hand clean. The Reapers have launched an ambush on the survivors.



"
Hunted
"


After the Reapers attack his group, Duncan shouts for everyone to run, then attempts to defend himself and avoid getting killed, but he gets wounded by the throwing knives. With the members fragmented into smaller groups, Duncan and Agatha manage to escape alive. Later, they arrive at a building where Maggie meets up with them. Duncan's wounds are too severe and he implores Maggie to get Agatha home safe before dying, and Maggie puts him down.



"
Rendition
"


In a brief flashback to the beginning of the previous episode, Duncan can be heard again, shouting for the others to run from the Reapers, just before Daryl takes off on his own.
