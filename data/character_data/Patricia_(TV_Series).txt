Overview
[
]


Patricia is a well-mannered, caring, and helpful woman. Though she isn't combat-proficient, her medical experience makes her an asset to the group. She is greatly distraught by the death of her husband, 
Otis
. At his funeral, she demands 
Shane
 tells Otis' final moments to see it had meaning. Shane tells the story that Otis sacrificed himself to save him so 
Carl
 could live, leaving Patricia satisfied. Unbeknownst to her, Shane had actually killed Otis so he could escape, something Patricia would never find out. 



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Greene Family Farm
[
]


Little is known about Patricia's life prior to or as the outbreak began. At some point, she and Otis dated and eventually got married. They both presumably lived nearby the Greene family (or possibly in the farmhouse itself with Hershel and his family) and when Otis was hired as their ranch foreman, she assisted him with his duties around the farm, and assisted Hershel Greene as his veterinary assistant. During this time, she befriended the Greene family and became an unofficial family member.

As the apocalypse broke out and everyone around their town was dying, the two of them decided to stay at the farm. While there, she continued to perform duties such as caring for the farm animals and helping Hershel with his veterinary work.

"
Bloodletting
"


Patricia joins Hershel and the rest of his family outside to meet 
Rick Grimes
 and is shocked to hear her husband shot Rick's son 
Carl
. Hershel tells her he needs his full kit, so she assists him with Carl's operation by retrieving his medical kit and passing him his stethoscope. She tells Rick to step back while she works and proceeds to set up an I.V for Carl. When Otis returns, she listens to Hershel talk about Carl's condition and she comforts Otis by hugging him when he claims he never saw Carl before he shot him. Later she restrains Carl when he is screaming during Hershel's surgery, and draws blood from Rick in order to help Carl. Afterwards she helps Hershel with Carl after he has stabilized Carl's blood pressure. When Rick nearly collapses from his blood transfusions, Patricia helps him up. She shows great concern over Otis' well-being, and demands that he not risk his life going to the high school with 
Shane Walsh
 to retrieve medical equipment, but Otis convinces her it's his duty. She goes outside to see Otis off and is in tears when she has to say her goodbyes to him and gives him a hug and a kiss before watching Rick give him his gun, then he leaves. She then watches him drive away and is anxious for his return back as she shakes her head as she still thinks it's too dangerous to go. She then attends to Carl and Rick again after another blood transfusion when Lori arrives, and then takes the equipment away.



"
Save the Last One
"


She remains by Carl's bedside while waiting for Shane and her husband to return. She later sews T-Dog's arm with the help of 
Daryl Dixon
's drugs (Merle's doxycycline) given to her by 
Glenn Rhee
 and tells T-Dog how lucky he is because his injury couldn't have gone untreated much longer. She jokes that Merle Dixon's "clap" (venereal disease) was the best thing that could have happened to him. Later Patricia prepares for emergency surgery on Carl by getting the trolley, equipment and lighting ready, but Shane arrives back at the farm with the supplies and Hershel tells her to stay with Carl while they go outside and Shane tells them of Otis's death. Hershel says that he will break the news to Patricia after they operate on Carl as he needs Patricia to be focused. Patricia is deeply distraught upon learning of Otis's death and is comforted by Hershel and Rick as she falls in tears and sits at the table. Her weeps and cries upset Lori and then haunt Shane as he watches her fall in tears in the kitchen.



"
Cherokee Rose
"


She joins everybody outside the house as both groups of survivors gather outside. She seems upset as Rick says Carl's gunshot was just a "stupid accident." After, she and everyone go to Otis's funeral. She pleads with Shane to tell her about Otis's last moments hoping that he did not die in vain, and she needed to know what happened. Shane comforts her and delivers his version of the eulogy to the group. Patricia seems to find some comfort from knowing his death had meaning in that he saved two lives (Shane and Carl). Although Otis was murdered by Shane, Patricia never learns this and the rest of the group are also unaware of this and believe his story.



"
Chupacabra
"


She is seen helping Rick's wife 
Lori
, 
Carol Peletier
, and Hershel's younger daughter 
Beth
 prepare for the dinner the women want to make. Carol thanks Patricia for allowing their group into her home (although technically it isn't her family home). She runs outside the house with everybody else to see why there was gunfire (Andrea shooting Daryl). After, she is seen at the dinner table sitting next to Hershel and Andrea with everyone else quietly eating. However, when Glenn mentions if anyone knew how to play the guitar, Patricia reveals that Otis played the guitar. Hershel replies that he was very good too, which makes an awkward atmosphere at the dinner table. She seems disturbed by it as it brings up memories of Otis and she stops eating. Patricia sits at the dinner table next to Hershel, which shows that she is well respected and an equal to Hershel as they are both older than the rest of the Greene Farm residents who, along with Glenn, are seated away from the main table at the "children's table".



"
Secrets
"


Patricia gets into the chicken coop, and overhears Lori and Carl joking around as they feed the chickens. She then leaves the coop and grabs a chicken and takes it to the shed to breaks its legs, after making sure that Lori and Carl outside couldn't hear by looking through a peephole in the shed wall. She then has several chickens in a sack on a wheelbarrow and takes them down to the barn, pausing momentarily to see Hershel's missing horse Nelly return. She feeds the chickens live to the walkers in the barn, looking horrified and disgusted at how ravenous they are. Later, she and Beth approach Rick and Shane and say that they would like to join them for gun training. Patricia says Otis was the only person on the farm who knew about guns, and now that he's dead they need to know how to defend themselves. Rick says he first has to ask Hershel for his approval. Beth's boyfriend 
Jimmy
 takes Patricia and Beth in Otis' blue wagon to the shooting range where Patricia is seen shooting a bottle while Rick and Shane walk by impressed, and watches everyone else, smiling, implying she's enjoying the session.



"
Pretty Much Dead Already
"


She and Carl play checkers or chess on the porch with Beth, and then watch quietly at the bickering between Shane and everyone else over the barn walkers. She runs along with everyone else to the barn and hears Shane tell everyone how the walkers are not humans anymore and they killed Otis. She is in horror when the walkers are let out of the barn and killed with shots to the head. Patricia stands quietly next to the devastated Greene family, who have to witness their walker family and friends being put down.



"
Nebraska
"


Patricia watches horrified at Beth being attacked by her walker mother Annette and assists Beth and leads her back to the house afterwards. She can be seen looking disgusted at Shane's accusations that they all knew about 
Sophia Peletier
 being in the barn and comforts Beth with a hug before helping her into the house. Later she attends the funeral for 
Annette
, 
Shawn
, and Sophia and is seen assisting Beth after she had gone into shock in the guest bedroom.



"
Triggerfinger
"


Patricia serves a bowl of vegetables for dinner to everyone and tells Shane "You're welcome" after he thanks her for dinner but immediately tells him that there's "No cussing in the house", angrily scolding him in front of everybody after he nearly swears in a conversation with Carl, to which he apologizes to her, embarrassed. She, along with a few others, greet Lori after Shane brings her back to the house after her car accident where she along with the others learn that Lori is pregnant. The next morning she is taking care of Beth and awaiting for Hershel's arrival back at the farm and claims that Beth is dehydrated. She tells Andrea that she will try her best to help by setting up an I.V for Beth, but that she can't do much without Hershel's help. When Hershel returns, he tells Patricia to set up the shed for emergency surgery. She gets Jimmy to stop staring at the prisoner by getting him to come inside. She is then seen with everybody else at the table discussing what should be done with the prisoner, and then leaves after they have finished.



"
Judge, Jury, Executioner
"


Patricia can be first seen helping Hershel and Jimmy in a field with the cows. Later she is with the group talking on what to do with the 
survivor held hostage
. She is initially sitting at the start of the discussion but stands to say to Rick that if they are to go through with executing him, how would it be done and would he suffer. When asked to make a final decision, she along with Maggie stay quiet and sit down. Later on at night, she is out in the field with the others when 
Dale Horvath
 is attacked by a walker and holds onto Maggie's hand while visibly crying before he is killed.



"
Better Angels
"


Patricia is seen briefly at Dale's funeral, and then again later when she brings a basket of eggs to the house while passing Jimmy and Beth barricading the windows on the porch. She is not present when the group moves their things into the house, nor when they discover that Randall is missing, and is most likely doing chores in the house or around the farm.



"
Beside the Dying Fire
"


Patricia is first seen in the house with everyone waiting for news of Randall's escape. She asks if he is back in the shed and suggests that Randall must have "fought back" when Daryl says that Randall was dead and a walker but wasn't bit. When the walkers invaded the farm, Hershel told Patricia to turn off the lights in the house so that they would be harder to find. When she has finished Beth tells her that the barn is on fire, to which Patricia says Rick most likely set it to draw them inside. She then tells a panicked and distressed Lori that Carl may be in the barn and set the fire. Once Carol calls her and Beth out of the house because they have to leave, Patricia attempts to flee with Lori, Beth, and Carol while holding onto Beth's hand. But before she can make it to the car, she is clotheslined by a walker that was out of her line of sight behind a car, hidden between the car and a tree and bitten in the neck, while another bites her arm, and eventually more walkers come and devour her from other areas of her body. All this time Beth is holding her hand, until Lori eventually pulls her away and they escape - all the while Patricia perishes as the walkers devour her. Later Maggie mentions her to Glenn when asking him if her family and friends have survived. When everyone meets up on the highway and talk of who they've lost and Hershel asks what has happened to her; Beth tearfully tells him her fate.

Trivia
[
]


Patricia is the last character to die in 
Season 2
.


In a deleted scene, Beth blames Lori for Patricia's death, and says that Lori threw her to the walkers to save herself. Lori denies this, claiming she was bitten and she would have dragged Beth down with her if she hadn't pulled her away.


In another deleted scene, Patricia can be seen at the gun training listening to Shane and then watching Carl learn how to shoot.


Patricia's role in the second season was expanded after McNeill was cast as the character. McNeill revealed in one of her interviews that she received a contract for only 3 episodes as Patricia in the second season, before the character got expanded into a full season character.
[1]


Patricia appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".
