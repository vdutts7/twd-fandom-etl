Overview
[
]


Gargulio initially starts as a timid, fearful, and uncourageous individual. He is shown to be observant and smart, as he was able to decipher 
Michonne
's message. Unlike 
Merle
, 
Tim
, and 
Crowley
 who merely laugh at Michonne's "biter gram," Gargulio is visibly disturbed and scared. After witnessing the gruesome deaths of Tim and Crowley, he freezes up in shock. Now with it just being him and Merle left, Gargulio is forced to step up in the hunt for Michonne. During the fight with Michonne, he manages to save Merle from a walker. Now having felt the heat of battle, Gargulio is shown to have gained more courage and bravery. While Merle is about to call it a day, Gargulio wants to continue pursuing Michonne and make sure she is fully dead. Unfortunately this new bravery would lead to his death at the hands of Merle.

"
Hounded
"
[
]


Gargulio is first seen with 
Merle Dixon
, 
Tim
, and 
Crowley
 pursuing 
Michonne Hawthorne
 after she departed Woodbury. She surprises them in the woods, attacking the group, killing Tim and Crowley before escaping. A shell-shocked Gargulio freezes up until Merle commands him to snap out of it. Gargulio reluctantly destroys Crowley's severed head before reanimation and they continue their search. Shortly after, Merle pushes him out of Michonne's way as she attempts to kill him, but nearby 
walkers
 are attracted to the noise and get immersed in the battle. Merle is in a struggle with one, and Gargulio saves his life by stabbing it in the head. After, Michonne escapes and the walkers are eliminated. Following this, Merle states that they should return to Woodbury, but Gargulio, exhilarated by the experience, wants to continue the pursuit. Arguing with Merle about this and about lying to 
the Governor
, he is betrayed and shot in the head by Merle.

.
