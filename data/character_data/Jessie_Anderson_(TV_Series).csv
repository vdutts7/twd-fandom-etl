,,,"Jessie was a smart, charming, warm-hearted woman and a loving mother with a ""bohemian spirit"". She cared deeply for those around her and would do almost anything to protect them. She understood the personal struggles of other people and did her best to encourage them and see a brighter future.
However, she had a vulnerable side to her, having lived for years in fear of her abusive husband Pete. She kept the emotional and physical pain to herself, not wanting anyone else to get hurt. That is until Rick came along and personally encouraged her to fight for her survival which had a notable effect on Jessie giving her the courage to finally stand up to her abusive husband.
After Pete's death though initially shattered her, she remained firmly protective of her two sons. She became aware of the harsh reality of the world and encourages the other Alexandrian's to fight for their survival mirroring Rick's wisdom bestowed onto her.  She adapted quickly, learning how to defend herself and acquiring the knowledge needed when it comes to handling walkers. Of all the Alexandrian's, Jessie was the closest with Rick, as she was the sole resident who helped Rick adjust into the community. The two shared a bond that eventually became romantic until her death.
According to 
Andrew Lincoln
 who has spoken about Jessie's relationship with Rick - ""she unlocks a part of him that hadn't been touched since the death of 
Lori
. She was hugely important in the rebuilding of Rick and his future at Alexandria"".
[1]","Very little is known regarding Jessie's early childhood, other than around her early teens, she attended art college where she presumably studied 
Sculpturing
, it was during this period where she met Pete upon where the two eventually fell in love together, it was through their relationship where Jessie eventually became pregnant with Ron at a young age; Jessie then married Pete several months later where around the time of their late 20's the two would later have another child Sam.
Following this, Jessie later became employed as a 
hair stylist
 amongst twelve other jobs, however due to Pete attending Medical School in order to provide for her eventually caused their relationship to suffer and thus Jessie and her two sons became victims to Pete's physical and mental abuse causing Jessie to lose her previous affection for him; however she never acted on this due to her fear of Pete.","At some point during the outbreak Jessie and her family made their way toward the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where they settled into the community and upon being interviewed by its leader 
Deanna Monroe
 was assigned as a pantry worker and became well integrated amongst the fellow residents of the safe-zone. Jessie sought to create a sense of normality for Ron and Sam both of whom had little knowledge regarding the outside world, she also began sculpting a metal owl-figure as a hobby. However Jessie and her sons were still subject to Pete's daily abuse which they kept hidden from the rest of the community.","Killed By

While making their way through a horde of walkers, Sam panics when he sees a little boy walker in the distance which causes him to freeze up and after Jessie, Rick and Ron fail to calm him down, he gets devoured by walkers.
Completely devastated by her son's death, Jessie starts sobbing hysterically; screaming out her son's name which begins to attract nearby walkers. She won't let go of Sam's hand and quickly becomes paralyzed in a state of shock as Carl attempts to encourage her to come with them.

A walker soon latches onto Jessie's shoulder to which she doesn't react to and suddenly she is swarmed and devoured while still gripping on to Carl's hand. Seeing this, Rick hacks her hand off to save his son's life, letting Jessie get dragged to the ground to be completely devoured.","This list shows the victims Jessie has killed:

Jessie was described as ""An attractive, strong, smart, charming and articulate woman with a vulnerable side. She's a mother with a bohemian spirit, and a talented artist.""


Upon being cast as Jessie, 
Alexandra Breckenridge
 explained: ""I didn't know anything. I hadn't watched 
the show
 before. I'd watched 
the pilot
 a long time ago, which I enjoyed, but I wasn't into the blood and guts at the time so I didn't continue watching for that reason. When I got the part, I watched all four seasons in a week and was having 
zombie
 nightmares. It was like cramming for an exam. I hadn't read 
the comics
 and when I first had my meeting with 
Scott Gimple
, he suggested not read the comics because the show and characters aren't always exact to the comics. If you've seen the comics, 
my character
 has short black hair with bangs and wears a headband â€” and she's a meek; she's a weaker character than I'm playing on the show, which is great because I enjoy playing a stronger character.""

Breckenridge confirmed that Jessie and 
Pete

Ron
