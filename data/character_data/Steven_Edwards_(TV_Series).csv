Dr. Steven Edwards,Contents,Overview[],Pre-Apocalypse[],Post-Apocalypse[],Death[],Killed Victims[],Relationships[],Appearances[],Trivia[],References[]
,,"Steven is a pragmatic, intelligent, but also cowardly man. As a doctor, his skills are highly valued by 
Dawn Lerner
, who Steven wants to keep himself useful too. He is shown to be willing to go to extreme methods to keep his high status, such as tricking 
Beth
 into killing his colleague 
Gavin Trevitt
 to ensure he is the only doctor at the hospital. He himself admits he knows he's a coward. Despite his manipulative nature, he generally seems to be a friendly individual, being one of the few to be kind to Beth and is disgusted by the actions of 
Gorman
 who sexually abuses others.","Not much is known about Steven's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was an internist located in Atlanta and that he and 
Gavin Trevitt
 were former colleagues.
When the outbreak began, Steven remained at the hospital waiting to be evacuated. He was forced to retreat back inside when the military dropped firebombs in the city. Eventually, he and the remaining police officers formed a group, that after a while, would ""rescue"" patients just to force them to do manual labor, under the pretext of ""repaying the debt they had with the hospital"".","Steven appears in this episode as a doctor working at Grady Memorial Hospital. He befriends 
Beth Greene
 soon after her arrival, and takes her on as an assistant (presumably in order to keep her away from 
Gorman
). He shows Beth how they dispose of bodies at the hospital, and later amputates 
Joan
's arm with the help of both Beth and 
Dawn Lerner
.
He appears to be discontent at the hospital, however he admits that he'd rather stay there than be outside its walls. He reveals he uses 
walkers
 as his motivation to stay inside, as he shows Beth a door on the ground floor which is surrounded by walkers. His strained relationship with both Lerner and Gorman is shown throughout the episode, and he threatens Gorman in order to keep him away from Beth and Joan.
He later lies to Beth about the medicine required by 
Gavin Trevitt
, which results in her accidentally killing him. He later reveals to Beth that this was in order to preserve his position in the community, and prevent himself from becoming expendable.
Edwards is first seen when Beth comes to visit him. He continues talking to her until she asks what kind of medicine 
Carol Peletier
, a new patient who happens to have been part of Beth's previous group, would need to survive. Edwards tells her what medicine to use and Beth leaves. Before walking out the door, Edwards wishes Beth the best of luck.
Dr. Edwards is present for the exchange of Officers 
Licari
 and 
Amanda Shepherd
 for Beth and Carol from 
Rick Grimes
. After Beth and Dawn are killed, Rick informs Dr. Edwards and the other patients that they can choose to leave the hospital with his group if they want. However, they choose to stay with the remaining officers.
With the multi-year time skip, the community of survivors at Grady Memorial eventually fell and everyone was killed, including Steven.

Steven Edwards (TV Series)/Relationships",,"The casting call for this character used the name 
Michael Alexander
.

Steven was described as ""Late 30s to Mid 40s. A casual, charming intellectual man. He's as quick with a witty remark as he is with a snide comment. Despite his intelligence and amiable fa√ßade, he suffers from an innate insecurity that makes him weak and self-serving.""",
