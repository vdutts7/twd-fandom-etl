Overview


Rufus is a loyal member of the 
Whisperers
, however he comes to find his loyalties to 
Beta
 are misplaced. When he, Beta, and another Whisperer find 
Alpha
's reanimated head, Rufus makes the mistake of declaring Beta as the new Alpha. Beta tells Rufus to take off his mask, and he is shown to be visibly scared. Beta pushes Rufus closer to Alpha and eventually gets his ear bitten off. Despite causing his inevitable death, Rufus sticks with Beta and doesn't seem to be fazed about dying. Beta then causes Rufus' death again by stabbing him and allowing him to be devoured by a walker.



Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Rufus' life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse


At some point following the outbreak, Rufus joined a large group of survivors known as the 
Whisperers
.



Season 10


"
Look at the Flowers
"


At the pike border, Rufus, 
Beta
, and another Whisperer discover 
Alpha
's reanimated head. Rufus deduces that 
Negan
 killed her and notes that this makes Beta the "Alpha" now. Enraged by his remark, Beta claims that Alpha can still hear him, before commanding Rufus to take off his mask. After doing so, he is asked by Beta if he can hear Alpha and what she is saying to him. When Rufus fails to answer, Beta shoves him closer to Alpha. He continues doing so until Alpha bites him and the other Whisperer flees in terror. After finally relenting, Beta takes Alpha's head off the pike and takes her with him, along with the bitten Rufus.

A short time later, Rufus and Beta are walking to an undisclosed location. Reeling from his infection, Rufus coughs, which attracts a nearby walker. Beta stands between Rufus and the walker in an attempt to shield his companion, but when the walker shows no signs of turning away, Rufus gets nervous and prepares to kill the undead assailant. Before he can, however, he is stabbed in the back by Beta, who then lets Rufus be devoured.
