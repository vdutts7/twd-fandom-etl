Trivia
[
]


While his name has not been mentioned in dialogue nor has the character been credited, the name 
Russ
 was given to the actor for the filming of "
Scars
".


Despite this extra being killed off in "Scars", he reappears alive after the time skip in "
Guardians
". This is an error due to filming not occurring in plot chronological order due to the time skip.


Russ appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.
