Nothing is known about Greg's life prior to or as the outbreak began.

"
Strangers
"
[
]


As Bob starts to wake up after being knocked out by Martin, Greg is seen looking down at the campfire which is roasting Bob's severed leg.



"
Four Walls and a Roof
"
[
]


Greg continues to eat Bob's leg. Gareth mentions that Greg and Mike was this close from capturing "that gray haired bitch who killed his mom", 
Carol
. Bob starts to laugh hysterically and Greg gets up with the others. Bob, after revealing his bite wound, says that he's tainted meat prompting Greg to spit out the food he was eating. Greg in outrage says that they might as well be eating one of the walkers, but is calmed by Gareth when he says that they cooked his leg before they ate it. Later, Greg travels along with the other Hunters to the church, after Rick leads the stronger survivors out to finish off the remaining Terminants. Greg, in the church searches it with the others, and when he is about to open the door where the remaining group members are hiding, Rick and the other half of his group ambush the Terminants. Mike and Albert are shot in the head, and Gareth gets two of his fingers shot off. Gareth orders the Terminants to surrender, and Greg does so accordingly. However, Rick does not let any of them go free, and Abraham, following Rick's cue, smashes Greg's head in with his assault rifle.

Trivia
[
]


Greg is the only named character directly killed by 
Abraham Ford
 in the 
TV Series
.


The way he is killed by Abraham is somewhat ironic, as Abraham himself gets killed by having his head bashed in with a weapon later on in the series by Negan.
