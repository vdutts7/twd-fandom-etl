,,,"Miguel is a snarky young man who is shown to be quite rude and uncooperative. After Miguel is taken captive by Rick's group, he initially refuses to talk and provokes Daryl which almost causes him to get attacked. He eventually gives in and takes Rick 's group to their base. Throughout the events, Miguel has an annoyed and irritated attitude rather than a scared one. Though Miguel is shown to be somewhat close with Guillermo such as him giving Miguel the nickname ""Little Man,"" they don't seem to be close enough to where he's willing to trade for Miguel if not given the bag of guns, which Miguel is shown to be uneasy over. However, eventually Miguel is let go with no harm done.","Not much is known about Miguel's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was born in 1996 and had a grandmother and a cousin .","After the onset of the outbreak, Miguel and the other members of the Vatos gang found refuge in a nursing home in the city, and they decided to protect all the seniors who were left behind by the nursing staff. As Daryl Dixon covers Glenn Rhee who is running after the bag of guns on the streets of Atlanta, Miguel creeps up towards the exit in the alley in which Daryl pops out and aims his crossbow at him. Miguel screams ""AYÚDAME"" (meaning ""help me"" in Spanish), prompting Jorge and Felipe to arrive and beat Daryl up, which is when Glenn arrives with the guns. They leave Daryl and abduct Glenn, but leave the guns behind due to Felipe being injured by Daryl's arrow. Miguel is then taken captive and briefly held in a foreman's office of a building. The men demand Miguel bring them to his stronghold , where they meet Guillermo . Guillermo demands for Miguel back and the guns, or Glenn would be killed. It is either that, or Rick and his men return ""locked and loaded"" in which Miguel becomes uneasy, asking for Guillermo to reconsider. Later, Rick Grimes and his party return to the base armed and ready. The door opens for the men and they usher Miguel inside and confront Guillermo for the second time. Miguel is released unharmed as an act of goodwill. At some point after encountering Rick's group, Miguel was killed along with the rest of the Vatos Gang and nursing home residents.","Killed By Unknown Cause At some point, everyone at the nursing home was killed. [1] Although it is not known how Miguel died, in a deleted scene for "" What Lies Ahead "", Rick's group returns to the nursing home to find all of the Vatos dead due to another unknown group of people having executed them and walkers invading the nursing home afterwards. It's possible that this event still happened (sans Rick's group returning after the CDC explosion).",This list shows the victims Miguel has killed: Possibly numerous counts of zombies,"For a more in-depth look at Miguel's relationships, read here: Miguel (TV Series)/Relationships Atlanta Nursing Home Guillermo † - Leader Abuela † - Grandmother Felipe † - Cousin Jorge † Mr. Gilbert † Atlanta Survivor Camp Rick Grimes - Former Enemy Glenn Rhee † - Former Enemy Daryl Dixon - Former Enemy Theodore Douglas † - Former Enemy",""" Vatos ""","Anthony Guajardo , who portrayed Miguel, had expressed interest in returning to the TV Series.
