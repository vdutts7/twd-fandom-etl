Overview
[
]


At first, Elijah seems to be a mysterious, quiet, and aloof person. Due to wearing a mask, he is initially hard to read. However, after taking it off for the first time, he is revealed to not be as stoic as he may seem, and is visibly scared of the 
Reapers
. He is shown to be a reliable friend of 
Maggie
, to whom he is extremely loyal. During their attack on 
Meridian
, Elijah becomes extremely vengeful against the Reapers, specifically 
Brandon Carver
, who murdered his 
sister
. When the Reapers are allowed to walk away, he is visibly enraged. He reminds Maggie of her promise to take revenge, which is the main factor in Maggie's decision to kill the remaining Reapers. Six months after the Reaper attack, he seems to have recovered and appears to be more open and easy-going. After the arrival of the 
Commonwealth
, he chooses to remain in 
Hilltop
, where he forms a crush on 
Lydia
, which later develops into a relationship.

"
A Certain Doom
"


In the woods, Elijah comes to the rescue of 
Aaron
 and 
Alden
 as they fight off the remaining 
Whisperers
.

Back at the tower, he arrives alongside 
Maggie
 and kills several Whisperers in an effort to save 
Gabriel
. As one Whisperer comes up behind him unnoticed, Maggie kills the Whisperer with an arrow. Afterwards, Maggie clarifies the masked man is with her.

At the rendezvous, Elijah stands by and nods at Aaron as he arrives with the others and as Maggie reunites with her former companions.



"
Home Sweet Home


Elijah accompanies 
Cole
 when going to meet 
Daryl
 and 
Carol
 with Maggie, and is introduced to the two by the latter as her companions. Elijah joins the four when Carol shows Maggie the remains of 
Hilltop
, and explains how 
Negan
 was both there when The Whisperers attacked and the reason 
Alpha
 died. As Carol leaves to head back to Alexandria, 
Kelly
 joins them, hoping to find her missing 
sister
. Maggie, Cole, and Elijah begin to lead them to where the rest of their group is camped.

After walking for hours, the five find an abandoned storage yard filled with the undead, which they efficiently start to clear out. After Maggie and Daryl struggle to shut a steel shipment container with walkers in it, Elijah steps in and helps force it closed, crushing a walker's head between the doors in the process. The survivors set up camp in the secured yard for the night, deciding to continue the rest of the way to the rendezvous point in the morning.

At sunrise, Elijah kills a walker that has wandered into the storage yard, prompting Cole to point out that Kelly was supposed to be on guard duty. Realizing she has headed off in desperate search of Connie, they go after her.

Finding Kelly trying to scale an abandoned truck in the woods with signs of recent survivor activity on the roof of the vehicle, Maggie angrily chastises her for leaving her post and putting them in danger. Daryl explains she's looking for her sister, which elicits sympathy from both Maggie and Elijah, the latter of which had lost his sister recently. After scaling the truck and searching through the contents on top of it, Elijah is unable to find anything useful in determining if Connie was there or not.

As they near the house where the rest of Maggie's group is, a smoke plume rising from its location causes Maggie to panic and rush towards it. Finding the house burned along with two of their people, 
Jen
 and 
Billy
, Maggie and Cole conclude it's the same group that attacked their village. With no sign of the others or Hershel, the group splits up to cover more ground, with Elijah going with Cole and Kelly.

Throughout the search, Elijah is visibly troubled at the idea of The Reapers having followed them. He's eventually comforted and reassured by Kelly, whom he shows his unmasked face to as a sign of trust.

Later, as Maggie and Daryl are struggling to fight against a highly tactical and well-adapted survivalist 
Reaper
, Kelly manages to shoot the man with Daryl's dropped crossbow, incapacitating him as Cole and Elijah join up with her and surround him. As Maggie tries to get the man to tell them who he is and what his group wants, he merely responds with "Pope marked you" before pulling the pin on a grenade in his satchel. Maggie, Daryl, Kelly, Cole, and Elijah all duck down and away from the ensuing blast, with blows the man into a red mist.

Maggie later manages to find Hershel hiding in a tree, and the group heads back to Alexandria. They stop at the same storage yard from before for the night, Elijah gives Kelly an apple, and Maggie thanks her for being a friend to him when he needed it, having apparently talked to him at some point about her.

As they finally reach Alexandria, they find it in near ruins, with many of the walls destroyed and knocked down, buildings burnt, and crops trampled by The Whisperers during their initial assault on the safe zone. Elijah subsequently joins the community with his comrades, as Maggie glares at a watching Negan.

"
Acheron: Part I
"


Elijah is part of a group consisting of Daryl, Gage, Maggie, Carol, Alden, Rosita, Lydia, Gabriel, Jerry, Roy, Kelly, and Magna who raid the abandoned 
Fort Connors
 military base for food supplies. He remains on watch on the roof as the women make their way into a hangar by rope to collect supplies. After the mission, Elijah returns to Alexandria with his fellow survivors. He is happy to see that fellow Wardens 
Frost
, 
Agatha
, and 
Duncan
, are alive and well. Later during a meeting, Elijah listens as Maggie explains that Frost, Agatha, and Duncan were separated and believed to have been killed after 
Reapers
 attacked their 
village
. Elijah and his fellow Wardens agree to accompany Maggie and a group of Alexandrians to Meridian to take out the Reapers and secure the food and water supplies to feed everyone in Alexandria.

Part of a group consisting of Maggie, Daryl, Alden, Cole, Frost, Gage, Negan, Agatha, Duncan, Roy, and Gabriel, the survivors utilize Negan's familiarity with the DC area to travel to Meridian. Due to the heavy rainstorm, the survivors are forced to head into the subway tunnels to complete the journey. While in the tunnels, they come across hundreds of body bags, many containing walkers in them. At some point while dispatching the body bag walkers, 
Gage
 and 
Roy
 go missing, along with the group's ammo and supplies. Shortly after this realization, a large group of walkers appear, forcing the other survivors to move forward in the tunnel without being able to search for Gage or Roy. He is able to make it into a subway car before the walkers are able to catch up with his group.



"
Acheron: Part II
"


Elijah and the rest of the Meridian mission survivors make their way through the subway tunnels and successfully fight their way through the undead to safety, despite losing 
Gage
, who was killed after running away from the group and becoming separated. With the storm subsided, Elijah and the rest of the group traverse down a road when suddenly 
Roy
 is shot and killed and a flying knife severs Cole's hand clean. The Reapers have launched an ambush on the survivors.



"
Hunted
"


After the Reapers attack his group, Elijah attempts to defend himself and avoid getting killed. When Maggie is lassoed by a Reaper, Elijah rushes in to free her only to be captured himself and hauled away.



"
Out of the Ashes
"


After somehow escaping the Reapers, Elijah reunites with 
Gabriel
 and they both find Maggie and Negan. Maggie tells Elijah that Cole, Duncan and Agatha are dead and Daryl and Frost are nowhere to be found. Gabriel suggests they wait for Daryl and Frost. Maggie smiles in agreement.



"
On the Inside
"


Elijah, Maggie, Negan and Gabriel hide from the Reapers, who are searching for them and they listen from the basement. Daryl finds them and manages to distract Carver long enough for Maggie's group to escape. Elijah and the group quietly sneaks out of the basement and escapes.



"
Promises Broken
"


Elijah and the group try to think of a way to get inside Meridian while Negan insists that the mission isn't worth it and that they should go home. Maggie pressures the group to move forward, and Gabriel refuses to go home having failed their mission. Negan promises to stay on the condition that he and Maggie would be even from then on, and Maggie reluctantly agrees. Maggie hits on the idea of gathering a horde of walkers to attack Meridian with, and Negan teaches the group how to blend in with the walkers with face masks and control herds, remembering his time as a Whisperer, though Maggie initially has trouble. Later, Maggie admits to Elijah that Negan is useful, but doesn't know if she can keep her promise. 

Elijah, Maggie and Negan wear walker masks and lead a 
herd
 toward a building. They open the doors to the building and release a massive herd of walkers. The walkers join the other herd on the road. Elijah, Maggie and Negan lead the horde toward Meridian.



"
For Blood
"


Elijah and Negan maintain the horde. An explosion sends shrapnel into their limbs. Elijah and Negan lead the horde toward the wall. Elijah, Negan and Maggie fight Reapers and walkers in the courtyard with Daryl joining to help them. 
Leah
 radios the Reapers with orders to pull back. After the courtyard is cleared of Reapers, she launches rockets at Maggie's group below.



"
No Other Way
"


Elijah and 
Negan
 manage to escape from the 
hwacha
 and meet up with 
Maggie
 who treats Elijah's injuries.

Elijah and Negan later join Maggie in ambushing 
Brandon Carver
 who Elijah recognizes as the Reaper who had murdered his sister 
Josephine
. Brandon's nonchalant attitude and lack of remorse infuriates Elijah who attacks Brandon, but proves to be no match for him. During the fight, Brandon kicks Elijah in his injured leg, sending him to the ground where he creates a distraction, allowing Negan to subdue Brandon. Elijah signals Maggie to kill Brandon for him, but she is stopped by 
Daryl
 who wants to trade Brandon to 
Leah
 for the supplies that they need.

Supported by Maggie and a crutch, Elijah makes his way to the meeting spot, insisting that even if he has to be left behind, Maggie needs to take 
revenge
 for Josephine. When Leah manages to turn the situation in her favor and Brandon mockingly blows kisses at him, Elijah advances on Brandon to take his revenge despite Leah's warnings. However, Elijah exhausts what remains of his strength and collapses before Brandon who prepares to kill him. Elijah is saved by 
Gabriel
 who wounds Brandon with a sniper rifle and forces Leah to take Daryl's deal. As Leah, 
Boone
 and 
Washington
 leave, Elijah, too weak to move, reminds Maggie of her promise to take revenge upon all of the Reapers for everyone that they've lost, prompting her to kill Boone and Washington and wound Leah who gets away. Grabbing one of Elijah's 
kamas
, Maggie drives it into Brandon's chest, killing him and getting Elijah his revenge. Elijah later sits on a porch looking at his weapon as the others collect the food.

Elijah returns to 
Alexandria
 with the others where the other 
Wardens
 support him. Seemingly traumatized by his experiences, Elijah just shakes his head at their questions.

Six months later, a recovered Elijah is a part of Maggie's community at 
the Hilltop
 when they enter into a standoff with Commonwealth soldiers led by Daryl.



"
The Lucky Ones
"

Marco
. Lydia tells them that she's decided to join the 
Commonwealth
. Elijah remarks that a lot of people have been leaving. 
A stranger
 soaked in blood approaches on horseback, then falls off his horse. He gives Lydia a map and says that a slaughter is taking place, before succumbing to his wounds. Maggie studies the stranger's map but says they lack the resources to help whoever sent the stranger. Elijah, Marco, and Lydia decide to head out on their own to help the stranger's group. Maggie changes her mind and accompanies Elijah and Lydia on their mission while Marco stays behind. Elijah, Lydia, and Maggie go to the complex to fight the Commonwealth troops after reuniting with Aaron.



"
The Rotten Core
"

kamas
 to 
Annie
's throat during a brief standoff at 
Riverbend
 before 
Negan
 defuses the situation. Elijah subsequently joins 
Aaron
 and 
Gabriel
 in searching the building for more survivors.

Later, as a part of Maggie's plan, a masked Elijah hides on the rooftop as Aaron and Gabriel lure 
Toby Carlson
 and two of his men up there. As the Commonwealth soldiers are distracted by the other two men, Elijah sneaks up on them and attacks, killing 
Green
 and the other soldier with his kamas while Maggie and Annie take out Toby's other men. Elijah watches as Aaron shoots Toby, causing him to fall off of the roof where Toby is devoured by his own reanimated victims below.

In the aftermath of the fight, Elijah helps Maggie and Lydia to put down Toby and his victims and to dispose of the bodies of the Commonwealth soldiers.



"
Trust
"


Elijah is on 
the Hilltop
's walls when 
Lance Hornsby
 arrives with the 
Commonwealth Army
, demanding access for an inspection looking for the 
Riverbend
 survivors and the Commonwealth's missing weapons. After 
Maggie
 reluctantly gives it to them, Elijah silently steps off of the wall.

Later, discovering Lance intimidating 
Hershel
, Elijah slams Lance up against a wall, leading to a standoff. After 
Daryl
 backs Maggie up, Lance agrees to leave and Elijah releases him with a glare.



"
Acts of God

Commonwealth
 soldiers inside. Maggie tells the group to follow the trail back to Lance's camp and end this. Suddenly Marco is shot by Leah, who survived the explosion which Elijah becomes distraught over.

"
A New Deal
"


After 
Lydia
 states she plans on joining 
Aaron
 on his trip to 
Oceanside
 to inform 
Rachel
 and 
Cyndie
 of their plan, Elijah walks over and affectionately puts his hand on her shoulder. He walks away as 
Carol
 jokingly teases Lydia. As 
Judith
 goes to hug 
Gracie
, Aaron, Lydia, and Elijah, along with 
Jerry
, leave for Oceanside.



"
Variant
"


Elijah, Aaron, Jerry, and Lydia are still making their way to Oceanside. Elijah and Lydia flirt with each other as Aaron smiles. After noticing a large 
herd
 of 
walkers
 coming down the road towards them, Aaron and Jerry have a small argument over what to do, but eventually go off-road to keep moving as Aaron wants. As they go off-road, a single walker turns its head, as if looking at the group.

Later, the group’s wagon gets stuck in a divot in the woods, and Elijah and the others try to pull it out. They finally do, but Jerry gets hit in the leg by the wagon, injuring him. Aaron spots a nearby site, an abandoned renaissance fair park, and suggests they take a rest inside. They arrive and begin setting up for the night. Lydia brings Elijah some wood to make a fire and kneels down to help. Elijah and Lydia start staring lovingly at each other and Elijah goes in for a kiss. However, Lydia backs away at the last second, causing an awkward silence. She then tells him she's going to get more kindle and leaves.

After Lydia and Aaron notices a small herd of walkers pouring into the fairground, they leave to go get Jerry and Elijah. The group briefly holds the walkers at bay, killing several, but are forced inside one of the buildings as the walkers continue swarming them. Aaron estimates the herd is at least fifty strong, and Elijah wonders aloud how they managed to get inside. The knob on a nearby door begins turning, and Jerry presses himself against it, holding it shut. Jerry asks when the dead began opening doors, and Aaron assumes it is the work of the Whisperers. Aaron then sends Lydia and Elijah through a hole in the roof, while Aaron helps Jerry get up. 

Lydia and Elijah help Jerry up, sitting him against a box. Elijah spots a small opening in the herd, and Lydia suggests they make the short jump. Aaron lets them head down so that they can flank the herd. The next morning, successfully having cleared the rest of the herd, Aaron and Jerry talk as Lydia and Elijah ready themselves to leave. As they head out, Lydia kisses Elijah.



"
Faith
"


In the woods, 
Lydia
 puts down a walker with her knife against the objections of Elijah who is worried that it could've been one of the climber variants. Although 
Jerry
 makes a joke about it, 
Aaron
 warns the others that they all need to stay alert as they don't know if their 
encounter
 with a climber was a one-time thing or not and there might be more of them out here. Aaron notices footsteps nearby, but Lydia recognizes them as being human, not walker. Aaron's group readies themselves to defend against possible threats, but 
Luke
 and 
Jules
 emerge from the trees instead. The friends are happily reunited with each other while Aaron introduces Luke and Jules to Elijah whom they have yet to meet. Jerry invites the two to join them in journeying to 
Oceanside
, but Luke explains that 
"it's gone, man. It ain't ours anymore. These guys in white gear 
showed up
 and... said they were from the Commonwealth"
 with Jules adding that they had just taken over. Aaron is surprised as they had 
made a deal
 with the Commonwealth, but Luke tells him that something must've changed as the Commonwealth Army is tracking him and Jules right now and they're dead if they're found. Luke suggests getting far away from Oceanside as humanly possible which Aaron agrees with. Shocked by the news, everyone begins moving out.

Aaron's group puts down several walkers and Luke and Jules explain that they were out scavenging and thus they weren't present when 
Lance Hornsby
's men arrived at Oceanside. They were hiding behind the houses trying to figure out what the hell to do with Luke wanting to stay and fight. However, 
Rachel
 wasn't having it and she insisted that they had to go, warn everybody and tell them what was coming which is why Luke and Jules had left in the end. Luke and Jules haven't seen Rachel or any of the others since and Luke feels guilty that they didn't stay and fight. Jerry and Aaron reassure them that they've got the group and everyone else now who are heading for Alexandria right now. Luke asks if that includes his old 
group
 which Aaron confirms. Hearing the sound of engines nearby, everyone quickly hides behind the wagon. Lydia and Elijah realize that the soldiers are closing in and that they can't outrun them. Spotting a 
herd
 moving nearby, Lydia looks at one of the dead walkers and gets an idea.

That night, Aaron's group, 
covered in walker guts
, moves with the massive herd, Lydia whispering directions to the others to move east. Two Commonwealth jeeps drive up and begins leading the herd in another direction, forcing Aaron, Lydia, Elijah, Jerry, Luke and Jules to follow them in order to maintain their cover. Lydia is bumped into by a walker, causing her to drop her knife which is then picked up by a variant walker that's amongst the herd.



"
Family
"


In the woods, a Commonwealth jeep leads a large 
herd
, amongst them 
Aaron
, 
Lydia
, Elijah, 
Jerry
, 
Luke
 and 
Jules
, 
covered in walker guts
. Spotting a break ahead to the right, Aaron whispers the message that it's now their chance with the others planning to make a break for the trees. However, as the group begins to make their break for it, a soldier pulls up on a motorcycle, leading a second herd in from the side that joins up with the massive herd that the jeep is leading, trapping Aaron's group amongst the walkers once more. From the other side, a third herd is brought in by another motorcycle, resulting in a massive herd of thousands of walkers having been corralled together by two Commonwealth jeeps and two motorcycles. Having completed their mission, the soldiers drive off, leaving the herd heading towards 
the Commonwealth
 itself which is just miles away.

As they continue, Aaron spots an abandoned RV up ahead and directs the others towards it. Putting down a walker in the RV, Aaron, Jerry and Lydia manage to get inside, but Jules gets swept away by the herd and Luke goes after his girlfriend. Trying to enter the RV, Elijah gets caught in the herd and as Lydia desperately tries to hang on to her boyfriend's hand, she is bitten in the left arm by a walker before Aaron and Jerry pull her into the RV as Elijah gets swept away as well. As the herd continues on towards the Commonwealth, a number of walkers begin banging on the RV's door, trying to get at the survivors within.

After 
amputating
 Lydia's arm, Jerry heads back into the herd to find Luke, Jules and Elijah. However, while Luke and Jules emerge from the herd in the Commonwealth, there remains no sign of Jerry and Elijah.



"
Rest in Peace
"


As 
Gabriel
 opens the gate of 
the Estates
 for the trapped residents, the crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in 
Alexandria
 and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified 
Lance Hornsby
, Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of 
suicide
. Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rifle, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back.

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates.

Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

A year later, Judith spots Elijah and Lydia and greets her friends who now work as couriers for the combined communities while continuing to date each other. Lydia, who has a prosthetic left arm now, hands Judith a package that she says is supposed to be a surprise before she and Elijah walk off together. Inside, Judith finds her old compass that she had 
given to Negan
 and a letter from Negan reading 
"Judith, this has always helped me find my way. I'm returning it to you now in the hope that it can guide you to your dreams. Thank you for letting me use it."


In Alexandria, Daryl and Carol, who is now wearing her hair short again as she did before Rick's disappearance, look at the old memorial wall of the people that the community had lost. Alexandria has been fully rebuilt and is thriving again with the residents enjoying everyday life together. Aaron, Gabriel, Coco, and 
Gracie
 greet Lydia, Elijah, Judith and 
RJ
 and Lydia gives Gabriel a package from Father 
Grant
 and his 
old congregation
. Daryl and Carol join them while Jerry and 
Nabila
, walking through town as their daughters play outside, smile at them. Aaron admits that he never thought that they'd get back to any of this, although he had hope. Aaron calls them all very lucky, but Gabriel corrects Aaron that it's effort rather than luck. They have a lot to be proud of in their family, community, and future.

Trivia
[
]


In "
A Certain Doom
", Elijah was portrayed by stuntman 
Joshua Lamboy
.


The weapons that Elijah is seen carrying are two Japanese sickles called 
kama
.


According to Angela Kang in 
Talking Dead
 for "
No Other Way
", the role of Elijah was originally much smaller but after Okea Eme-Akwari's audition tape of him performing silent grief, they decided to expand his role and give him more story.


Originally, Elijah was intended to have first encountered 
Maggie Rhee
 shortly after departing on her first expedition with 
Georgie
, however, this was later scrapped, likely due to the expansion of Elijah's character upon the casting of Okea Eme-Akwari.
[2]


Elijah appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Alex Meraz
 confirmed that Elijah was originally going to be the one to kill 
Carver
, before they later changed it to Maggie.
[3]


Elijah is the only named resident of Meridian, Warden or otherwise, confirmed to be alive.
