Overview
[
]


Alpha is shown to be a highly intelligent, cold, psychopathic, sadistic, cunning, and egocentric woman who is a hardened, determined survivor and a strong leader to those in her group.

Alpha has been willing to commit murder from a young age, killing her own father at only the age of nine. However, Alpha claims that her father deserved it, although it is unknown what she meant by this, it suggests that she may have been the victim of abuse or something similar that had pushed her to such an extreme at a young age.

While telling her story to 
Hera
, Alpha states that, before the events in the 
Baltimore shelter
, she did what a woman like her was supposed to do - what they were told.

She appears to enjoy being in a position of authority and does not take kindly to anyone who opposes her, as she has brutally murdered her own 
husband
 in front of their young 
daughter
 after he refused to abandon their fellow survivors during a walker attack, 
Matias
 after he refused to listen to her by attracting unwanted attention, and 
Helen
 after she voiced disdain for her decisions as leader. Alpha appears to despise anyone she views as being weak and justifies cold-blooded murder as a way to eliminate weakness from her group. This was displayed when she slaughtered 
Sean
 due to him crying after Helen's decapitation at her hands shortly before. She is shown to have no qualms about killing anyone, whether they be adolescents, or the elderly as shown by her brutal slaughter of members of the 
Coalition
 in order to send a message to her enemies. She is also a skilled knife wielder, being able to hold her own against 
Daryl
 and severely wound him despite suffering severe injuries herself.

For a period of time between the events in the shelter and joining the Whisperers, Alpha recognized that she 
"went 
mad
"
 in the shelter and tried to repent for her actions. During this period, Alpha attempted to be a good person and a good mother and was subservient to 
Brooke
 aside from arguing about Lydia and Alpha's more realistic view of the world as compared to Brooke. However, 
a threat
 brought out Alpha's ruthless side in force to protect her daughter. Alpha states that 
"I ran towards repentance. But you can't run forever."
 The end of these events would see an end to her attempts to be a good person which she later referred to as the "death" of Dee and the beginning of Alpha, the version of Alpha that had completely abandoned her good side in favor of being a ruthless survivor.

Alpha is shown to have completely devolved into nothing but a hardened and primitive survivor. She doesn't even use her real name anymore and rarely reminisces about her past, showing that she has completely shed the identity and life she once had and has adapted fully to the post-apocalyptic hell. She sees no hope for mankind returning to its original state and views survivor communities as destined to fail, believing that devolving into wild animals is the only true way to survive. Alpha is also a great manipulator and psychological torturer who has successfully been able to manipulate and brainwash nearly a hundred survivors into becoming savage, psychopathic murderers almost completely loyal to her and the primitive lifestyle of the group while completely abandoning their previous lives and identities much like her. 

Despite her extreme methods of survival, Alpha is a strong survivor and her effective leadership has kept many people alive, affirming the belief that her savage ways make people stronger. However, she does not appear to care for her fellow Whisperers on a personal level and Lydia herself reveals that those who are lost, taken captive, or killed are left behind and no attempts are made to rescue or avenge them. She will quickly murder any members who question her decisions or displease her. Her lack of personal care for her group was exemplified when she nearly allowed a helpless 
infant
 from her group to get eaten alive by approaching walkers simply due to it crying, viewing the act as a part of "natural selection".

Alpha is a terrible mother and is nothing but cruel to her young daughter and only remaining family, having psychologically abused her into thinking her father was the abusive parent and that she was kind and protective towards her, even allowing Lydia to be physically abused by their fellow group members as well as herself. Despite this, Alpha may not be completely heartless and may only want her child to survive, subjecting her to cruel treatments in order to make her strong and ensure her survival, regardless of the psychological torment Lydia has endured. She even actively kidnaps Alden and Luke and goes to the 
Hilltop
 in order for Lydia to be freed and returned to her, something she apparently has never done for any other Whisperer. Despite her cruelty towards Lydia, it is evident that Alpha sincerely loves her child as shown by her shedding tears in "The Calm Before" after Lydia refuses to leave 
the Kingdom
 with her and she murders a fellow Whisperer in order to prevent the group from learning her one true weakness: her love for her daughter. Despite this, her desire to maintain her power over her group is likely stronger than her love for Lydia, which is likely the primary reason why she murdered the Whisperer who witnessed her crying. However, Alpha wasn't always this harsh to Lydia, showing an obsessive worry for Lydia's safety on 
Brooke's Steamboat
 and even breaking down after she saw just how much pain her actions had caused her daughter. This was before Alpha fully became Alpha however and thus before she became as fully ruthless as she later was.

After disowning her daughter, Alpha begins to second guess her choice and it becomes apparent that she sincerely misses Lydia, even building a secret shrine to her at their former camp. She begins to show mercy towards others who are in a similar situation as her such as when 
Frances
 almost risked the Whisperers' lives by crying over having had to abandon her son thus leading her to comfort her in private. Another instance is when Carol attempts to shoot her to which she forgives, sharing the experience of a mother knowing what it's like to lose a child (though despite this she still sent a 
Whisperer
 to trap and kill Carol as revenge for this). Regardless however Alpha appears to have gotten over her feelings for Lydia as time went on and remains dedicated to keeping her dominance over her group and tormenting her enemies into respecting her territorial boundaries, though she is not completely without reason as she chose not to punish the Coalition for trespassing into her territory 3 times previously and instead chose to extend her boundaries as punishment.

However, it is gradually revealed that it has been Alpha's intention all along to destroy the Coalition rather than simply keeping them from entering her lands as she personally entrusted 
Dante
, a newcomer to her group, to infiltrate Alexandria and sabotage the community from within, tearing them apart through fear. She also has secretly been sicking herds on Alexandria and Hilltop to slowly wear them out, showing her strong desire to destroy her enemies. It is shown that Alpha holds personal vendettas strongly as shown when she personally lured Carol, Daryl, and their group into a cave containing her horde to kill them all.

Upon encountering her daughter again in "
Stalker
", Alpha again demonstrates her love for her child and expresses her desire for Lydia to succeed her as the leader of the Whisperers after her death, showing that her cruel treatment of Lydia has been leading to this and that Alpha truly respects her daughter's abilities. However after Lydia rejects her again and insults her by claiming her way of survival is not the only way, she appears more angered and bloodthirsty than ever and openly declares she will exterminate the communities and take utter pleasure in it. 

Despite this, Alpha's love for her child remains intact in spite of her final betrayal even though she vows that she will kill Lydia herself in order for her to be truly free. She even develops a genuine fondness and attraction to Negan and claims she wants to abandon the Whisperers and start a new group with him, showing that she is still capable of loving others in spite of her decent into a savage, primitive survivor. Ultimately however, Alpha's cruelty towards her daughter and desire to end her would ultimately be her undoing as she is lured into a trap by Negan through circumstances orchestrated by Carol and brutally murdered. She dies a psychopathic, cruel and savage mass murderer and a hated, despicable mother willing to kill her own child for refusing to conform to her barbaric ways of survival.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Mid-Atlantic, United States
[
]


Not much is known about Alpha's life prior to or as the outbreak began, when she was nine, Alpha killed her own father, claiming 
"he deserved it."
 Based on her accent, she grew up or lived somewhere in the Appalachia region of the United States, possibly somewhere in western part Maryland. In adulthood, she had a husband named 
Frank
 and a daughter named 
Lydia
. She appeared to be an abusive but protective mother to her daughter, once slapping her after she nearly suffocated herself to death after being tangled in a plastic tarp to ensure she would never do it again.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Baltimore, Maryland
[
]


Alpha, along with Frank and Lydia, survived the initial stages of the outbreak. After 23 days, she and her family remained in a moldy basement with a group of survivors. Alpha was eager to leave, but her husband insisted that they stay. Alpha eventually cut her hair off to spite Frank, who liked her hair long, explaining that she could do whatever she wanted since it was the end of the world.

After 43 days, the undead began to overrun the outside of the building. A fellow survivor, 
Matias
, started to have a panic attack and wanted to leave the basement. Alpha, knowing noise could draw them in, smothered Matias to death by crushing his windpipe, believing that he was too weak to survive this world. Later that night, unknown to the group about the virus infecting the living, a reanimated Matias began to attack the group. Alpha then attempted to lead her family to safety by escaping, but Frank tried to save their friends, which resulted in Alpha 
murdering
 him.

"
Dee
"


In a flashforward, Alpha addresses an unseen audience, stating 
"let me tell you how I died."


In the present, Dee walks onto the back deck of 
Brooke's Steamboat
 where 
Brooke
 and 
Lydia
 are talking about Lydia's dress. Noticing Dee's plainer clothes compared to herself and Lydia, Brooke asks if she would be more comfortable in a suit, but Dee wonders why she'd ever wear one. Brooke claims that it's just a joke and assures Dee that she looks great. When Brooke asks Lydia if her mom looks great, Lydia just shrugs and Dee tells her that looking good doesn't mean anything. Brooke tells Lydia that it feels nice though and fixes a flickering light bulb while Lydia looks nervously at her mother. Dee questions if having the lights on are a good idea, but Brooke tells her that the guards are on duty and they have been trawling this area for weeks, it's clear. Taking Lydia's hand, Brooke leads her away, leaving Dee alone on deck.

Entering the bar, Dee takes off her jacket and sits next to 
Mr. Langston
 and watches Brooke and Lydia through the bar's mirror. The bartender, 
Billy
, asks Dee why she isn't sitting with her daughter and suggests that Dee should make more of an effort, offending Dee. Billy tells Dee that she looks like shit and someone has to say it. Dee states that Billy hasn't earned the right and he mentions that he's only been there for a couple of weeks, but he's seen how it works. 
"Brooke bends over backwards making everything nice. People like you show up looking like drowned opossums, taking advantage of what's provided,
" Billy accuses asking if she knows how many people would kill to be there. Billy suggests that if Dee doesn't want to be there, she should just go back to her room. Dee firmly tells Billy that she came for Lydia and Billy asks why she's sitting across the room then. Billy then leaves to get more wine and Dee notices the outside lights flickering in the reflection in the glass of the door that Billy exited through.

Emerging out on deck, Dee turns off the outside lights. Hearing a noise, Dee looks on shore and sees figures moving through the 
fog
. Following Dee on deck, an annoyed Brooke turns the lights back on and tells her that the figures on shore are just the dead. Dee tells Brooke that she doesn't trust Billy, but Brooke is skeptical as Dee doesn't trust anybody. Changing the subject, Brooke states that Lydia has not so subtly reminded her that her birthday is coming up and suggests that Lydia is on to them. Brooke asks for Dee's help with Lydia's party as Lydia deserves a nice surprise. Dee knows, but she's worried about resources, especially since Lydia is the only kid. Brooke insists that it's been over a year, and they've given Dee more than enough time to adjust. Children need structure and normalcy, schedules, rules and celebrations are important. Dee worries that Brooke is setting Lydia's expectations too high while Brooke feels sorry for Dee who is so caught up in what could go wrong that she can't enjoy the good stuff which is having a negative effect on Lydia. Brooke insists that there's a time for both caution and joy and she has scheduled it all out so that they can carry each other's burdens. 
"Otherwise, what's the point? Lydia is a sweet girl. She deserves more than this."
 Dee slowly advances towards Brooke with a knife, apparently intending to attack her. However, one of the steamboat's fishing nets swings between them with a walker inside and Dee uses her knife to put it down. Covered in walker blood, Brooke silently holds out her hand and Dee hands over her knife without another word to her.

In a flashforward, Alpha tells her audience that she was nine when Dee killed her father. However, Alpha claims that he deserved it. After her father's death, things were fine she guesses, and Dee did what she was supposed to - what women like her are told to. Then the world fell apart and she got stuck in a 
basement
 with her husband 
Frank
. Alpha doesn't know if she meant to kill Frank, but she's glad that she did.

In the present, Dee lies on her bunk and gets up after hearing a splash outside. Dee looks out her cabin window at the shore, but she can't see the source of the splash.

That next morning, Dee enters the bar to mop when Brooke asks if she saw the missing Mr. Langston after room checks. However, Dee only saw him getting drinks at the bar. Brooke asks if anyone heard anything, and Dee remembers the splash that she had heard and defends not bringing it up because the swamp is always making all kinds of noises. 
Nolan
 agrees with Dee that it could've been anything and Dee suggests that they ask Billy who was serving Mr. Langston. Walking out on deck after Brooke talks to Billy, Dee gives him a suspicious look.

Dee demonstrates setting out silverware to Lydia who tells her mother that Brooke says that she needs another dress for a garden party. Neither Dee nor Lydia knows what that is, but Lydia starts going on about her love of fairies who live in gardens. Dee cuts her daughter off, asking Lydia believes in fairies before resuming her silverware lesson. Making sure that no one else is watching, Dee slips one of the knives into her pocket just in case something goes wrong and she needs a weapon. Dee suggests that a garden party sounds nice, but Lydia tells her mother that she can go while Lydia will stay. Dee warns Lydia that Lydia will die without her, but Lydia believes that Dee thinks that she'll die either way. Dee promises that she can save her daughter and she won't let it get her, but Lydia states that she has Brooke. Hurt and upset, Dee orders her daughter to finish without her and leaves.

As Dee composes herself, she notices a reflective light flashing against the wall next to her. Heading outside, Dee finds Billy who seems to drop something into the water as soon as he notices Dee's approach. Billy asks for Dee's help with the anchor, but she accuses him of dropping something in the water. Dee guesses that it was a mirror and asks what's out there before calling for Brooke. When Brooke arrives, Dee accuses Billy of signaling someone off-shore with a mirror that he dropped in the water when Dee caught him. Billy insists that Dee is lying with Nolan backing him up that there's no one out there as the swamp is filled with the dead. Dee asks where 
Erika
 is since she was supposed to be helping Billy. Erika calls out that she was putting the other net away and was with Billy up until two seconds ago and they were working. Dee points out that Billy was also the last person to see Mr. Langston too and suggests that Billy was responsible for the old man's disappearance. Brooke calls it a big accusation, but Dee reminds Brooke that Billy has only been there for three weeks, and they don't know him. Dee wants Brooke to get rid of Billy and, noticing the knife in Dee's pocket, Billy accuses Dee of wanting to kill him. Pulling out the knife in a non-threatening manner, Dee tries to defuse the escalating situation, but Billy jumps overboard.

As Nolan races to look for Billy, Brooke confronts Dee about threatening Billy with a knife. Dee insists that Billy read it wrong, but Brooke realizes that this is why Lydia is afraid of her own mother. Upset, Dee orders Brooke not to talk to her about her daughter. With Dee having just cost them a worker, Brooke orders her to cover Billy's shifts until she finds someone else. If Dee ever treats anyone like that again, she's gone. With the dead, the snakes and the gators, Brooke is sure that Billy will never make it out of this swamp. Having witnessed these events, Lydia runs away, chased by Dee.

In the future, Alpha tells her audience that she went 
mad
 in the Baltimore shelter, but that she tried to repent for her actions.

In the present, Dee knocks on the door of her cabin, calling out to her daughter and trying to get Lydia to talk to her. However, Dee finds the room empty, and Brooke tells her that Lydia needs some space. Dee demands to know where Lydia is, but Brooke wants to know 
"what sort of terrible thing would frighten a little girl so much that she hides from her own mother?"
 Dee tells Brooke that Lydia is hers and that everything that Dee does is to protect her child. Dee insists that she's the only one that can keep Lydia alive and make sure that she keeps herself alive. Dee again demands to know where her daughter is, but Brooke refuses to answer, instead asking to what kind of a life is Dee keeping Lydia alive. Drawing her knife, Dee threatens to kill Brooke if she doesn't tell her where to find her daughter.

Their argument is interrupted by screams from the deck which the two women rush to check out. Brooke and Dee find one of the guards dead with his gun gone and hear men rounding up the rest of the crew. Brooke realizes that one of the men is Billy and wants to go for the armory to try to save her people, but Dee is only interested in finding and escaping with Lydia. Brooke finally tells Dee that Lydia is in the dinghy and Dee rushes off to find her daughter while Brooke heads out in the other direction to try to save her people from Billy and 
his gang
.

As Billy demands that Dee and Lydia surrender themselves, threatening to start killing hostages, Dee sneaks up and slits the throat of the 
man
 holding Brooke captive. Taking his gun, Dee shoots and kills 
another
 man that advances towards her, sparking a fight between the steamboat residents and Billy's gang. Taking advantage of the chaos, Dee pulls the rope to release the dinghy and jumps into the water after it. Boarding the boat and pulling up the tarp to reveal Lydia, Dee orders her daughter to listen to her and be quiet and lay down which the terrified Lydia agrees with. Dee tells her daughter that the people on the steamboat turned on them both and she is going to take them away from there to someplace safe. Dee rows them ashore as the gunfight on the boat continues and several people jump ship.

On shore, Dee and Lydia encounter a 
herd
. Dee quickly puts down a few walkers, but her knife gets stuck in the head of the last one. Unable to free her weapon in time, Dee falls to the ground and ends up pinned beneath the walker's corpse as more walkers show up and start devouring the survivors of the steamboat around them. In a desperate move, Dee cuts open the body of the walker on top of her, covering herself in its blood and pulls Lydia under the corpse with her, smearing Lydia's face in walker blood as well. The 
camouflage
 works and conceals Dee and Lydia from the herd until they finish devouring the survivors and move on. As they hide, Dee reassures her daughter of her love for her and that they are safe now.

Once the herd passes, Dee cuts them out from under the walker's corpse and another corpse that had fallen on top of it and, having Lydia close her eyes so that she doesn't see the carnage around them, leads her daughter away. As they continue through the swamp, Dee spots a despondent but still alive Brooke nearby. Dee sits her daughter down, gives Lydia her bunny and covers her ears with a pair of earmuffs so that Lydia doesn't hear what happens next. Drawing her gun, Dee approaches the battered Brooke and accuses her of promising her daughter the world and then taking it all away. In turn, Brooke accuses Dee of being sick and being responsible for the fall of the steamboat, but Dee is unrepentant, having done what she had to do in order to save Lydia, what a real mother does. Brooke reveals that everyone else is dead, but Dee doesn't care as they would've killed Lydia too.

As Dee prepares to shoot Brooke, Lydia rushes between them and refuses to allow her mother to kill her friend. When Lydia won't relent, Dee shoves her daughter aside and takes aim again. However, Dee stops when she sees Lydia curled up into a ball nearby and singing "Lydia the Tattooed Lady," the comfort song that Frank would use on their daughter. Relenting, Dee tells her daughter that Lydia's right and she's not going to kill Brooke and gets her daughter to calm down. Dee replaces Lydia's earmuffs and puts the gun in the bag that she leaves with her daughter as proof that she's not going to kill Brooke. Walking up behind Brooke and shushing her, Dee states that Lydia was right: death is too forgiving for Brooke. Taking her knife, Dee slices open Brooke's left cheek from just below her left eye, through her lips and stopping at her chin. Covering Brooke's mouth to muffle her cries, Dee tells Brooke that this is Dee's mark and everywhere Brooke goes, Dee will be there to remind Brooke how she failed Lydia. Returning to her daughter, Dee walks away, leaving Brooke behind.

Continuing their walk through the swamp, Lydia wants to go back to the steamboat, but Dee reminds her that there is no boat anymore, it's just them now. Lydia knows that this is what Dee had wanted, for Brooke to be wrong and Dee tells her that Brooke was wrong, and she was teaching Lydia a lie and it is now time for Lydia to know the truth and Dee loves her daughter enough to show her. However, Lydia doesn't want to be with her mother, she wants to go to her birthday party. Dee begs her daughter to be strong, but Lydia tells her that Frank said that it's safer with people. Dee insists that Lydia has to learn to survive without people as people hurt each other, let each other down and are chaos. Lydia states that people aren't chaos, Dee is. Dee acknowledges that Lydia doesn't like her much right now, but she's all that Lydia's got, and Dee won't fail her daughter again. Lydia demands to know where her father is, and an emotional Dee tells Lydia that her father was weak, and Lydia can't be like him.

The two resume walking and eventually reach the 
Sunny Creek RV Park
. After checking that one of the trailers is empty of the undead, Dee and Lydia enter, and Dee finds an energy bar for them to eat. Finding a tea set in another room, Dee suggests that they can have their own party, but finds Lydia outside. Lydia draws her mother's attention to what she thinks is people from the boat, but is in reality a small herd of three walkers. Dee calls her scared daughter behind her and Lydia tries to run into the RV, but Dee stops her. Taking advantage of the fact that she and Lydia are still camouflaged by the walker blood covering them, Dee slowly leads the herd backwards, announcing that it's time for her to show Lydia how to survive. Dee lures the walkers under the trailer's awning, but Lydia refuses to watch Dee and learn how to deal with them. With their shouting catching the herd's attention, Dee yanks the awning on top of them, but accidentally drops her knife in the process. Dee manages to retrieve her knife, lures the walkers to the other side of the awning and then stabs each of them in the head through the canvas, putting them all down. However, Lydia runs off into the trees, chased by her mother.

In a flashforward, Alpha tells her audience that 
"we're all we have. We do what we think is right. Even if it hurts the ones we love."


In the present, Dee desperately searches through the trees for Lydia, finally finding Lydia sitting by a creek. Terrified, Dee yells at her daughter to never run away from her again, but Lydia shushes her, telling her mother that the fairies are here, she heard the trees talking and they want to take her away. Lydia begs Dee to let her go and Dee embraces her daughter and tearfully apologizes for everything. Dee admits that she's been so selfish because Dee has been so scared of the thought of this world without her daughter in it that she never thought about Lydia in this world. Dee wonders what kind of a life this is, recognizing that this isn't any place for a child.

Taking out her knife, Dee has Lydia close her eyes and prepares to end Lydia's life and her own in an act of 
mercy
 so as to spare her daughter the horrors of this world. However, Dee hears whispers around her, reassuring her that they see her, and they are there. 
People
 wearing walker masks emerge from the trees and surround Dee and Lydia, whispering that they see them and are there to save them and order them to whisper. Dee demands to know who they are and what they want. The leader removes her walker mask and identifies herself as 
Hera
. Telling Dee to whisper and not speak, she kicks Dee in the face, knocking her out.

In a flashforward, Alpha tells her audience that she was keeping herself from her nature but that was the end of Dee and the beginning of Alpha. Alpha's audience is Hera's removed face with Alpha saying that Hera showed her love. After killing Hera, Alpha has turned her face into her walker mask as part of her final transformation from Dee into Alpha, the ruthless leader of the Whisperers.

According to Lydia, her mother watched many survivor communities thrive and then eventually fall, including 
Brooke's steamboat
, and she thus evolved into a more hardened survivor willing to resort to whatever measures necessary to survive. Alpha ended up spending over a year on the steamboat with her daughter. While on the steamboat, Alpha, although not remorseful for killing Frank, recognized that she 
"went 
mad
"
 while in the shelter and tried to repent for her actions by being a good person and a good mother to Lydia who was afraid of her mother after witnessing Frank's murder. In the years that followed, Alpha would tell Lydia the reverse of events in the beginning, that Frank was the abusive one and she was the one trying to protect Lydia, that a reanimated Matias killed her father, and not Alpha herself.

After the fall of the steamboat, Alpha and Lydia were rescued by the 
Whisperers
, led by a woman named 
Hera
, who Alpha had romantic interests in. Alpha refers to the end of the steamboat and joining the Whisperers as the "death" of Alpha who, for all of her faults, had been trying to be a good mother and a good person before 
a threat
 ended the community. This caused Alpha to fully embrace her ruthless side rather than trying to suppress it. Alpha and Lydia either were banished, left the group, or went on a supply run and 
encountered
 the former country musician known as 
Half Moon
 at a hospital. After bonding, Alpha recruited him to join her. Not wanting to be reminded of his celebrity, Alpha gave him the face of his friend and called him "Beta", and her "Alpha". 

Upon returning to the camp, Alpha assumed control after killing Hera. Alpha then let her turn and used her face as her mask. Picking up new survivors along the way, she instructed them to use this practice and all of the group members were forced to shed their previous identities and names, becoming nothing but hardened and primitive survivors. They survived off the land, moving from place to place. The group communicates whilst moving among herds by whispering with gruff voices, hence their name, similar to what a walker may sound like if it could talk. By herding walkers, the group was eventually able to culminate a large horde numbering in the thousands to be used as a potential weapon.

Outside Hilltop, Alpha and the Whisperers wait for them to bring Lydia to her. 
Daryl
 asks them to leave and Alpha signals for more Whisperers to show up. 
Magna
 asks Alpha if they killed their people. Alpha says no and promises if they don't bring her Lydia there will be conflict. Daryl then decides to walk outside to talk to Alpha face to face.

Alpha instructs one of her people to bring someone as Daryl walks outside. He then informs Alpha he's ready to fight her people to ensure she doesn't get Lydia back, when he then spots one of the Whisperers with a 
baby
. Alpha explains they're animals and 
"animals have babies."
 Suddenly, a couple of whisperers bring up a tied up Alden and Luke. Alpha offers to trade both of them for her daughter.

Meanwhile, a herd arrives and Alpha instructs her people to draw them away. Suddenly, a Whisperer's baby starts crying, which attracts the walkers over. Alpha shrugs at the mother, indicating she should leave the baby to die. Alden and Luke scream for them not to but Alpha explains it's natural selection. She then watches as 
Connie
 runs out of the cornfield, sling-shots a walker, and grabs it.

Later, Daryl goes outside and hands Lydia over to Alpha in exchange for Alden and Luke, who are embraced by Enid and Magna's group. Lydia apologizes to her mother and Alpha smacks her across the face, ordering her to address her as Alpha like everyone else. She then smiles at Daryl as they leave.  



"
Guardians
"


In the woods, Alpha questions Lydia about her time at Hilltop. She talks about their farmland, supplies, and weapons, but leaves out their dealings with other communities like The Kingdom. Alpha's disappointed over her lack of intel so Lydia asks if that's the only reason she came for her. 
"What a stupid question"
, Alpha says.

A while later, Alpha and the Whisperers stop in the woods to rest. unknown to her, 
Henry
 watches them from a close distance. Suddenly, 
Beta
 grabs Henry from behind and tosses him in front of Alpha. He says he's been tracking Henry for a while, but Henry's been tracking them for longer. Alpha questions him as Beta threatens to break his arm. Henry relents and reveals he came alone to get Lydia. She calls him stupid and punches him in the face. Alpha decides Henry's coming with them.

In the woods, Alpha asks Lydia why she didn't mention Henry, but she says he wasn't worth mentioning. Alpha reminds her that he just risked his life to save her, so she must be lying. They arrive at the 
camp
, which is full of people without their walker masks. Alpha instructs Beta to tie Henry to a tree and to get Lydia a new mask.

Later, Alpha taunts Henry when two of her own approach her and question why they gave up two people for her daughter. 
"I don't like that math"
, 
Sean
 whispers. Alpha reminds them she did it to get information. Sean issues a challenge for her leadership role. Alpha laughs in his face and Beta grabs the man from behind and holds a long knife to his throat. 
"You're changing the rules again"
, he says calmly.

Alpha confirms he has the right to challenge her position, but she has the right to defend it. She then turns her attention to 
Helen
 and suggests it's actually her who wants to be the new leader. Helen tells Alpha she failed everyone by putting them in danger. Alpha tells her that her people voluntarily follow her because she keeps them safe. Alpha then wraps a wire around Helen's neck and decapitates her as Henry looks on in horror. Alpha then hands the head over to Sean, tells him crying is for the weak and stabs him in the stomach.

In her tent, Alpha tells Beta about the time before the apocalypse when she hit Lydia hard for almost suffocating in a dry-cleaning bag. She tells him that people do whatever it takes to protect those they love. 
"We need to be ready when they come for the boy"
, Beta says. They both agree Henry can be useful and they need to find out if Lydia truly has feelings for him.

At night, Beta takes Henry to Alpha. She makes Lydia pick up a knife and tells her to kill Henry with it to prove what side she's on. Lydia begins to cry as she approaches Henry. Alpha warns her not to be weak like her father and that if she doesn't kill him, Beta will kill them both. Suddenly, a small herd of walkers show up and begin eating the unmasked Whisperers. Alpha and the others quickly put on their masks to try to lure the herd away as chaos unfolds in the camp.



"
The Calm Before
"


In the woods, Alpha ambushes a couple from Hilltop and kills them. She then proceeds to scalp 
Hilde
 to use her hair as a wig and her dress as a disguise to infiltrate the Kingdom's fair.

Later that day, Alpha walks around the fair in her disguise. She observes the trading booths, paints and people celebrating. 
Ezekiel
 notices her and introduces himself. She presents herself as Deborah from 
Alexandria
 and asks him to show her around. Alpha is then somehow able to kidnap several residents and has them be taken away to a barn in the woods. That night, Alpha sits down next to Lydia in the movie theater and quietly tells her not to say anything. Outside, she confronts Lydia about being a traitor but she tells her this is a better way of life. She then threatens to scream if she doesn't leave and Alpha tells her she was never one of them. Lydia breaks down in tears as Alpha leaves.

Alpha then arrives at the barn as the kidnapped residents try to fight back and proceeds to kill them all. However, she lets 
Siddiq
 live to warn the others and to try to divide the communities by scaring them. She then decapitates her victims and places their heads on pikes in the middle of a border, separating the Whisperer's land and the communities.

Later that night, Alpha approaches Daryl and the group tied to a tree in the woods. Assuming the ambush is because of Lydia, Daryl tells her that she will not be getting Lydia back to which Alpha questions him if he thinks this is truly about Lydia. She tells them she ran into trouble on the road as she wipes her bloody knife on her pants. 
Michonne
 warns her if she tries to get Lydia back they'll respond in force, but Alpha assures her Lydia isn't her concern anymore, worrying Daryl who questions what she means. She takes out a shotgun and declares that Michonne's group is in no position whatsoever to threaten her and that this habit needs to be broken. She orders Daryl to follow her.

At dawn, Alpha forces Daryl to the top of a cliff where a massive horde of walkers and Whisperers walk beneath them. Alpha says Daryl's communities are a joke and that her way of life is best for her people. She then tells him his friends at the camp are fine, but the next time his people cross into her land she'll release the horde into theirs. She clarifies she marked the border and Daryl asks if she killed Lydia. Alpha tells Daryl she didn't and doubts he can protect her. He tells her she's wrong and leaves. 

In the camp, Beta asks Alpha about Lydia. 
"I want to be alone"
, Alpha orders him, but a Whisperer accidentally witnesses her crying. She stabs him in the neck, making sure no one sees her being weak.



"
The Storm
"


Sometime following her attack on the communities, Alpha and the rest of the Whisperers move to a warmer state to avoid the harsh winter during the next months. In their camp, Beta tells Alpha 
"the time away has been good for the pack."
 Alpha reminds him she'll need to be strong for what comes next and Beta assures her she will be. He then whips her arm with a branch to make her strong, giving her very similar marks as what she did to Lydia.





Season 10

Content








Several months after the blizzard, Alpha orders 
Dante
, due to his loyalty and because Lydia doesn't know him, to join Alexandria as her spy and sabotage the community from the inside. 



"
Lines We Cross
"


Alpha is remembered in a post-traumatic flashback 
Siddiq
 has to the prisoners' last stand. She looks at Henry with an evil smile and then holds her bloody machete following the decapitations.

In the present, 
Daryl
 and 
Carol
 visit the spot where Alpha showed Daryl her massive 
herd
, now gone. As the two begin to leave, Carol notices something in the trees below. Alpha emerges and wordlessly glares up at Carol.



"
We Are the End of the World
"


In the past, Alpha and Lydia walk among walkers covered in blood when they come upon an 
injured woman
 being devoured. Alpha tries to mimic the walkers' behavior when Lydia drops her earmuffs and screams. They are forced to run and seek shelter inside an abandoned hospital, where they find a 
man
 wearing a ski mask.

In the present, Alpha and Beta talk about their enemies and the fear they possess on them. He says they should return so they won't forget about them, but Alpha questions his loyalty towards her decisions. Beta says he would never question her and is sent to collect walkers for their herd with the help of 
two
 
sisters
.

Back in the past, Alpha explains to the masked man that she and her daughter don't mean harm. He allows them to stay for the night. Later, Alpha cleans Lydia in a bathtub. Lydia is scared by the sound of walkers but Alpha insists she just listens to it. They look through supplies and eat. The masked man explains to Alpha that he doesn't want to hear her singing and that the sound of the dead is the only sound he never wants to end.

In the present, Alpha witnesses as Beta orders Frances to be killed and demands they leave her alone. Beta follows her and says she needs to punish Frances. Alpha angrily tells him to not question her and claims he would never understand what it feels to lose a child. She then orders him to send Frances to a tent where she will be waiting. In the past, Lydia tells Alpha that she wants to be like her. Alpha is thrilled by this but tells her to stop calling her mama. Back in the present, Alpha meets with Frances in a tent. She orders her to remove her mask and kneel. Alpha grabs Frances' head and prompts a scream heard throughout the camp, but ultimately pardons her.

In the past, Alpha walks around the hallways of the hospital and encounters some walkers. She starts killing them and is joined by the masked man. Afterward, he helps Alpha open the walkers' carcasses so she can use the blood later on. She jokingly decides to call him "B" and claims that makes her the "A". When she tries to see his face under the mask, he demands she leave at sunrise and not come back.

Back in the present the next day, Alpha leads a group of Whisperers to a field to gather more walkers. Suddenly, a satellite crashes through the sky and the herd starts to scatter. Frances witnesses a walker with a strapped baby carrier and starts having flashbacks to when she abandoned her son. She runs towards Alpha and jumps on her causing the herd to get riled up. The herd closes in and Frances is pulled off Alpha by her sister and thrown to the middle of the herd to be devoured. 

At their camp, Alpha questions Frances' sister on whether or not she regrets letting her sister die. She confesses she will always be loyal to Alpha. Beta approaches and questions Alpha about why she is calm after losing three of their people and their herd. Alpha, however, claims she is proud of the woman. That night, Alpha anoints the woman a "Gamma" and the group praises her as Beta watches with jealousy from behind.

In the past, Alpha wakes up and looks for a missing Lydia around the hospital. She enters a room and finds photos of Beta with his face scratched out of all of them. Beta finds her and is mad that she wandered there. She then kills a 
walker
 wearing a smiley face t-shirt after it comes out another room. Beta loses it and starts wrecking the place. Lydia arrives and ultimately stops him from killing Alpha. He kneels by his friend's side as Alpha approaches him and declares "We are the end of the world." She lifts his mask to look at his face and chuckles, seemingly recognizing him. Beta doesn't want to leave his friend behind and she declares he won't have to, giving him a knife so he can peel his friend's face off.

In the present, Alpha is at a shrine she has made to Lydia and is followed by Beta. She breaks down and says she couldn't kill her daughter, before destroying the shrine. Alpha then pleads with him to keep Lydia's life a secret. He promises he will and informs her that the enemy has crossed the border. Alpha smiles and says they will return to teach them a lesson. Later, the Whisperers move around the woods with their herd as Alpha notices something in the distance. She wanders off and looks at Carol watching her from a distant cliff.



"
Ghosts
"


Alpha sends Gamma to inform Daryl and Michonne to meet her at the northern border to talk. That night, Alpha arrives with some Whisperers and reminds the group to stay off her land. Michonne explains the fire would have wiped out Oceanside and they only crossed one time, but Alpha reminds her of two other times they trespassed. Alpha declares that there will be no bloodshed, and instead announces she's moving the border up as punishment. Carol says they don't have to listen to her bullshit.

Daryl tries to get her to leave but Alpha says not until Carol lowers her eyes to her feet. Alpha tells Carol she should fear her but Carol says she feels nothing at all. Alpha reminds her how Henry feared her before she beheaded him, causing Carol to pull out her gun and shoot. Daryl manages to hit her arm so she misses as the Whisperers draw their weapons. Michonne apologizes to Alpha for Carol's behavior and Alpha says she forgives her "mother to mother." She then smiles evilly and orders the group to leave since they are in her land.



"
What It Always Is
"


Alpha instructs Gamma to take a walker and use its guts to contaminate the river where the communities take their water from. At the camp, she teaches a Whisperer how to skin a walker when Gamma arrives from her mission to ask for another guardian. The Whisperer then demands that instead of using more walkers for slower strategies, they should release their herd on the communities. Alpha allows the group to vote but nobody agrees with him. She then cuts the Whisperer on his arm and leg and hands the knife to Beta to kill him and be used as a new guardian. 

Later that day, Gamma confesses to Alpha that Aaron gave her gauze for her wound. Alpha shushes her and instructs her to sit, before removing Gamma's mask. They discuss sacrifices and Gamma tells her that her sacrifice was much greater, in reference to Lydia. Alpha says Aaron might be useful for her plans and they might have to wear a new mask. 



"
Bonds
"


Alpha is informed by Beta about a captured 
Negan Smith
 who was found trespassing in her border. She argues with Beta that Negan should be tested to see if he is worthy to talk with her. When he objects, Alpha notes that Beta has been questioning her rather often lately and asks if he is finally challenging her. Beta kneels in submission and vows that he will never challenge her. Alpha forgives him and then orders him to test Negan for the rest of the day. 

Later that night, Alpha watches as Negan is thrown to the ground after asking for food. She notices as he obeys and sits somewhere else. After a while, Alpha has Beta take Negan to walk among one of their herds in the woods as part of his final task. The next morning, Alpha is informed by Beta that Negan died because he was weak but is suddenly left in shock when a blood-covered Negan arrives back and kneels to introduce himself to Alpha. 
"I'm all in, whatever you want, whatever I got, it's yours,"
 Negan tells her. Alpha leans down to sniff him and shushes him to signal she accepts him.



"
Open Your Eyes
"


Alpha is remembered in another post-traumatic flashback Siddiq has to when he was forced to watch by Dante as his friends were beheaded. She tells him to watch as she brutally decapitates D.J. and Enid. 

In the present, Alpha finds Gamma in the woods and watches as she kills a walker. She questions her about Aaron and Gamma says she learned his name and that he has a daughter. Alpha wonders if she asked about her sister's child but Gamma swears she didn't. Alpha then tells her to remove her mask and proceeds to whip her arm so she can remain strong. She goes on to tell Gamma that Aaron is tempting her with lies and she shouldn't be seduced. 



"
The World Before
"


Alpha somehow changes her horde's hiding location to a cave after being uncertain of Gamma's loyalty. Later that day, she purposely attracts Carol's attention from across a clearing and runs into the woods to lure the Coalition group inside the building where they fall into the cave below and become trapped with the horde.



"
Squeeze
"


Having trapped members of the 
Coalition
 with her horde, Alpha looks at them from the top of the cave and smiles in pleasure as Carol shouts at her in anger. She leaves and orders some Whisperers to not let them escape. That night, Alpha arrives at her camp and informs Beta and Gamma that their enemy has crossed the border and they were heading to the National Park where the horde was located. She assumes that they've sent spies beyond the border and assigns more guards, before sending Gamma to carry a message to their spy in Alexandria.

The next day, Alpha is in the camp's bathroom when Negan arrives. He tells her about a possible traitor among them, and suggests that it may be Gamma because she is close to her. Alpha holds a knife to his crotch and tells him not to sow paranoia in the camp, warning if he's wrong she'll cut his balls off. She then tosses him into her bathroom ditch and leaves. However, she thinks about his words and realizes he could be right. Sometime later that day, Alpha asks Beta about Gamma's whereabouts and is informed she didn't make it to the border. She implies that Gamma is the traitor and wants Beta to track her down and bring her to the camp alive so she can kill her in front of the whole pack

Following this discovery thanks to Negan, Alpha takes him in the forest. When they stop, she orders him to undress. Negan, thinking Alpha's about to kill him, admits the power he had over 
the Saviors
 turned him into a monster. Surprisingly, he turns around to find Alpha fully naked. She says he deserves a crass reward for detecting the spy. Negan's amused because she will keep her mask on and wonders if she'll decapitate him like a female praying mantis afterwards, but she doesn't answer him and smirks. He says he'll take his chances and the two kiss.



"
Stalker
"


Alpha and some of her Whisperers escort lead part of their herd of walkers from the cave towards an unknown point. While they are passing through a river, Daryl ambushes the group and manages to kill the escorts. The duo then engages in a fight where Alpha slices his face under the eyes, worsening his vision with blood. She is then thrown into the ground and impaled in the shoulder with a tree branch as Daryl yells for Magna and Connie's whereabouts. The fight draws nearby walkers' attention and Alpha stabs him in the leg as they flee the scene separately.

Weakened and losing blood, Alpha follows Daryl into an abandoned gas station where she looks takes a seat and bangs her shotgun on the wall to attract walkers in the vicinity which will protect her and attack Daryl. When three walkers are lured inside, she growls at one for them to hide her identity and watches as Daryl kills them before they both pass out. That night, Alpha remains bleeding out on the floor and starts a speech about light and darkness, stating that she's grateful for everyone who's made her strong. When Daryl says she drove Lydia away because she didn't love her, she becomes offended and tries to approach him, but faints due to the exhaustion.

Alpha briefly awakes and sees Lydia standing over her. She wonders if Lydia's real and starts to sing a lullaby while placing her daughter's hands on the knife above her heart, saying she's ready to lead the Whisperers after her death. Lydia tearfully declines to kill her mother and says she blames her for not letting her live a normal life like she always wanted. The following morning, Alpha wakes up alone and sees the words "Your way is not the only way" carved into a workbench with her knife. She stares at the inscription in frustration, before starting to laugh evilly. Sometime later, Alpha is surrounded and has her wounds tended to by some Whisperers. She stands up and promises to get revenge on the communities with their horde while pronouncing the Whisperers' anthem, officially declaring the war.



"
Morning Star
"


In the woods, Alpha hands Negan a branch and orders him to whip her arm, before she does the same to him. Later, the Whisperers march with their horde. Beta chants "We are the end of the world", and the other Whisperers follow. Alpha continues the chant by saying "We take them all", as Negan marches beside her, now equipped with his very own Whisperer mask.

Out in the woods, Negan approaches Alpha and proposes that she gets Alexandria and Hilltop to surrender instead of destroying them, thus adding their populations to the Whisperers' ranks. Alpha asks him to elaborate. When the Whisperers attack the Hilltop, Beta commands the Whisperers to launch the sap they collected earlier using makeshift catapults into the front lines, drenching most of the defenders as well as the Hilltop's walls. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltop resident ablaze. 

Behind the Whisperer lines, Negan is puzzled, since he thought Alpha wanted the survivors to join them. Alpha assures Negan that they will, as part of her horde, much to his bemusement.



"
Walk With Us
"


In the aftermath of the Hilltop attack, Alpha and the Whisperers kill the survivors, though she has them aim for the heart so that the survivors will reanimate and become a part of the horde. Alpha chides 
Negan
 when he bashes a survivor's head in and isn't pleased with their victory as she still doesn't have 
Lydia
. 
Beta
 informs Alpha that Lydia is not amongst the dead and promises to look for her.

Negan later approaches Alpha, revealing that he has captured Lydia. Negan leads Alpha to 
a shed
 where Lydia is located, though he tries to talk Alpha out of her plan to kill Lydia so that her daughter will always be with Alpha as part of the horde. Recognizing that Alpha still loves Lydia, Negan relates the story of his love for his wife 
Lucille
, but Alpha refuses to be dissuaded. Negan apparently accepts and Alpha opens the door, only to find that Lydia had been kept somewhere else by Negan. As a confused Alpha turns to Negan, he suddenly slits her throat. Catching the falling Alpha, Negan gives her a kiss before gently lowering Alpha to the ground where she quickly bleeds to death.

After Alpha's death, Negan delivers her severed zombified head to 
Carol
. Upon seeing Alpha's severed head growling at her, Carol comments that it took Negan long enough, revealing that Negan and Carol had been working together to kill Alpha.



"
Look at the Flowers
"


Carol
 places Alpha's severed zombified head onto a pike at the border, apparently satisfied with her 
revenge
. Carol heads off on her own as Alpha's head growls, angry that it took 
Negan
 so long to kill Alpha and fulfill their deal.

Alpha's severed head is later found by 
Beta
 and two 
Whisperers
. After 
Rufus
 identifies Beta as the new Alpha, Beta forces the man to walk forward to "listen" to Alpha who bites off Rufus' ear before Beta removes and cradles her head in his arms. Beta carries Alpha's head to 
an abandoned hotel
 containing a guitar and a poster of Beta as his pre-apocalypse self Half Moon where Beta uses his old music to draw a 
herd
 to himself.

Wandering through the forest, Carol begins to hallucinate Alpha who tells Carol that she is "always watching." Alpha follows Carol taunting her about the deaths of 
Henry
 and 
Sophia
 and claiming that she respects Carol's method of killing her. Alpha suggests that Carol regrets her actions since people were hurt in the name of revenge and demands to know what Carol truly wants. After killing a walker that ambushes Carol while she is distracted, Carol claims that she wants to be alone, but Alpha doubts it.

Alpha continues to haunt Carol as she tries to get a boat to leave, but the distraction causes Carol to accidentally bring part of the boathouse down on herself. As a walker emerges from the water and makes its way towards Carol, Alpha tells her that no one is coming to save her after what she did to 
Connie
 and Carol always knew how it had to end. Alpha urges Carol to give up and reminds her of all the people she has lost already and could lose in the future if Carol goes back. Alpha suggests that Carol chose to hallucinate her in particular because she knew that Alpha could get the job done and convince her to allow herself to die. Alpha tells Carol to "just look at the flowers, like you're supposed to" and counts to three. However, Carol manages to free herself and kill the walker. Carol tells Alpha that its never too late and Alpha vanishes.

At the hotel, Beta talks to Alpha's zombified head, thanking her and stating that he sees now. Beta stabs Alpha in the head and cuts off a piece of her face to replace his ripped walker mask before leaving the hotel.

Alpha is the fifth major recurring primary 
antagonist
 in the 
TV Series
, the first being 
Shane Walsh
, the second being 
The Governor
, the third being 
Gareth
, the fourth being 
Negan Smith
, the sixth being 
Lance Hornsby
, and the seventh being 
Pamela Milton
.

Alpha is tied with The Governor as having the third most appearances in the TV Series, appearing in a total of 17 episodes alive (she appeared as a undead/hallucination both in "
Look at the Flowers
" and also appeared in a flashback in "
A Certain Doom
"), behind Shane with 18 episodes and Negan with more than 40 episodes.


Alpha is the first major recurring primary antagonist in the TV Series to be female, the second being Pamela Milton.

Alpha is also the second female character to be classified as a season's primary antagonist, with the first being 
Dawn Lerner
 and the third being Pamela Milton.


Alpha is one of two major recurring primary antagonists confirmed to have a living relative (her daughter Lydia), the other being Shane Walsh who also has a living 
relative
.


Alpha is the second major recurring primary antagonist to interact with another major recurring primary antagonist; Negan.


Alpha is currently the only major recurring primary antagonist to be killed by another major recurring primary antagonist; Negan.


Alpha is the second major primary antagonist to become a 
walker
, the first being Shane Walsh and the third being Lance Hornsby.


Alpha is currently the only major recurring primary antagonist to die before the major recurring secondary antagonist.


Alpha is the only LGBT major recurring primary antagonist.


Alpha currently holds the highest kill count of any female antagonist on 
The Walking Dead
.


Alpha has killed the third most main characters with a total of 2: 
Enid
 and 
Tara Chambler
. She is surpassed only by the Governor, who has killed 3 main characters and Negan who has killed or been responsible for the deaths of 6 main characters (including herself).

Alpha is the second main antagonist to kill more than one main character in one episode (Enid and Tara Chambler), with the first being Negan.


It's possible that her name is Deborah as that is the name she used while she infiltrated the 
Kingdom
, although she could have also just randomly chosen the name in order to stay undercover.

Her real name was revealed to be Dee in 
Tales of the Walking Dead
. It's still possible that her full name is Deborah, as Dee could simply be a nickname that she preferred to use instead of her full name.


The term "Alpha" denotes the dominant role or position in a particular sphere or group.


She is one of eleven known characters to have seen 
Beta
's face.

The other ten characters being 
Lydia
, 
Mary
, 
Daryl Dixon
, 
Negan Smith
, Beta's 
best friend
, a 
Whisperer
, 
Daniel Salazar
, 
Grace Mukherjee
, 
Dennis Graham
 and 
Silas Plaskett
 with the latter four being unknowingly.


Just like her comic counterpart, Alpha's signature weapon is a sawed-off double barreled shotgun although she rarely uses it. A holster for the shotgun can be seen on her belt.


Alpha being decapitated by Negan is ironic as she now receives the death that she gave to the ten innocents in "
The Calm Before
".

Negan also jokes about decapitation before he had sex with her, foreshadowing Alpha's demise.


Alpha is one of the youngest known characters to have committed murder, killing her own father at the age of nine before the outbreak as revealed in "
Dee
".


Alpha may be the victim of some kind of abuse from her father as she claims that her father deserved to die, suggesting that he had done something to provoke her to action.

Being the victim of abuse at a young age may explain some of Alpha's psychological issues.


Alpha is the tenth main character to outlive her comic book 
counterpart

, the second being

, the third being

, the fourth being
