Overview
[
]


Beth is a shy, soft-spoken, and caring sixteen-year old girl who lived a normal life with her family. She lived on her father's farm and attended the local high school. She went to church regularly and strongly believes in her faith. As a result of her father's heavy drinking, she never drank alcohol. Her first appearance was in 
Season 2
 and as the season developed, so did she. As the apocalypse started, Beth had been sheltered from the chaos surrounding her. At first, Beth is rather timid, pessimistic, and keeps her emotions to herself, but after being forced to see her mother's death and horrific reanimation, Beth finally breaks down and a different part of her is shown. She tells her sister, 
Maggie
, that she wants to commit suicide. However, after an attempt at slitting her wrist, she has a change of heart and decides to live. With the support from her father and sister, Beth regains her will to live and since then, becomes even more assertive and stronger-willed, even after the death of her boyfriend and 
Patricia
.

By the time the group arrives at the 
West Georgia Correctional Facility
, where they will remain for nearly seven months, Beth has grown more self-assured and goes on to become a more important and vocal member of the group. Beth is a source of optimism and hope for the group, often singing to help boost morale. She is much more hopeful and optimistic and sees the positive side rather than the negative side in a hopeless situation. After the death of 
Lori Grimes
, Beth helps the rest of the group with taking care of Lori's newborn baby 
Judith
.

After the 
Woodbury
 conflict, Beth is emotionally stronger, trying many different ways to deal with the loss of hope that grows everyday, realizing that things may someday take a turn for the worse. After dating 
Zach
, she becomes emotionally distant, preparing herself so that when someone she loves dies, she won't shut down emotionally like she would have in the past. After Zach's death, she spends her time dealing with the new crisis surrounding the prison. Beth keeps hope alive, while struggling with herself not to break down emotionally. After her father's death, Beth is distraught but grows stronger and finds new strength in herself. Beth becomes more independent and more skillful at killing walkers. After she escapes from the prison assault with 
Daryl Dixon
, the two become very close, and Beth's faith becomes stronger. She believes there is still hope and good people somewhere, even in this cruel world. She also thinks that since walkers used to be human, they shouldn't be treated cruelly or be made fun of, but instead, respectfully put out of their misery to preserve their humanity.

When she is taken to 
Grady Memorial Hospital
, she becomes even more independent, being forced to help care for patients at the hospital whilst planning an escape with 
Noah
.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Greene Family Farm
, 
Georgia
[
]


Beth Greene was born to 
Hershel
 and 
Annette Greene
 in 1994 on the Greene Family Farm in rural Georgia. Beth was born the youngest to two half-siblings, her older brother 
Shawn
, who belonged to her mother, and 
Maggie
, the eldest, who belonged to Hershel and his late-wife, 
Josephine
.  

As Beth grew older, Maggie initially resented her and her side of the family, but through her father and beliefs came to love Beth, Annette, and Shawn. Beth also became close with family friend and farmhand, 
Otis
, and his wife, 
Patricia
. Hershel still had his habit of drinking alcohol, but strictly forbade her ever to drink. Hershel also raised her to do good things in life, and to believe in God and faith. Hershel always protected Beth from the harsh reality from the outside world and not to follow the bad things he had done in his past life, such as going to jail and drinking alcohol. Her family raised her to have good manners and behavior, and were usually overprotective of her. 

Unlike Maggie, Beth was oblivious to the outside world. She perceived things in a different perspective, and as a result she believed that there's goodness and hope in everything, even in the most desperate situations. As evident, when Beth was twelve and Maggie had returned for her first summer from college, she found birth control pills in Maggie's bag. In horror, she threw them in the lake and was caught by Maggie who was horseback riding. The two began to argue, later involved by Shawn, and the commotion caused Maggie's horse to cover all of them in mud, making them laugh and resolve their issues. When Hershel asked what had happened, Beth lied for Maggie. 

As a young child, she had a passion for singing and playing the piano and guitar. She attended high school, along with 
Jimmy
, and began a casual relationship with him roughly three months before the outbreak. Jimmy was often protective of Beth.



Post-Apocalypse
[

Greene Family Farm
, 
Georgia
[
]


As the outbreak went global, Beth's mother and Shawn were bitten by walkers. The two later died from the infection. Hershel had Otis take them to the barn where they reanimated. Due to what they saw on the news, Hershel believed the walkers were still alive and are simply sick people and that while dangerous, needed to be cared for as he believed the pandemic would end and a cure would save them. Their ignorance was a mixture of grief and being mostly spared by the apocalypse on their isolated farm. 

Hershel barricaded his remaining family, Jimmy, Otis, and Patricia within the farm. Beth was devastated by her mother and brother's deaths, and her typically positive outlook on the world slowly started changing to a more grim and hopeless one. Over time, Otis began to bring more walkers to the barn, in which Beth and the others were in charge of helping put them in and feeding them with live chickens. Among those in the barn were their cousin, 
Arnold Greene
, their 
neighbors
 the 
Fischers
, and friends 
Lacey
 and 
Duncan
.

Beth tells Daryl it wouldn't kill him to have a little faith, and he replies "Faith didn't do shit for your father." She looks at him, angered, before turning away and ignoring him. She finds berries on a tree and tells Daryl the others will be hungry when they find each other. Daryl hands Beth his bandana and she puts the berries in it for safe keeping. While traveling in search for the others, a walker attacks Beth, but Daryl pulls it away. The walker then falls onto Daryl and Beth stabs it in the head. Together, the two head down the train tracks seen throughout the episode. They see a pile of bodies of people from the prison. Beth finally breaks down. She cries after she believes one of the bodies is Luke's. Daryl turns around to tell her to move along, but she stays there, crying. Daryl doesn't comfort her. Later that night, Beth and Daryl set up a small camp and she told herself to believe for her father and everyone else that they could stay at the prison safely for the rest of their lives.



"
Still
"


Beth and Daryl come across a destroyed car along the side of the road and she tries to hot-wire it. Walkers are heard coming from the trees and both of them hide inside the car trunk, waiting for the walkers to pass. The next morning they get out, scavenge the car for anything useful and leave. Later, Beth sets up a small camp and starts a fire with things that she found while scavenging the car they were hiding in. She collects condensation from plants in a water bottle, and lets a lady bug crawl on her finger. While they both eat the rattlesnake that Daryl skinned, Beth says that she wants a drink. Daryl throws her a water bottle, but she clarifies that she wants some alcohol (due to her father not allowing it). She goes off to find some but encounters several walkers. She distracts them by throwing a stone and luring them away but before she could manage to continue, Daryl finds her and brings her back to camp. Furious, Beth flips out, stating that she wanted something to do rather than just sitting around in their camp, and will find some alcohol, whether Daryl helps her or not. They make their way to a country club, but the front door is locked and walkers are chasing after them. They break in through the back entrance and find walkers, hanging by their necks from the ceiling, having committed mass suicide while still alive. Daryl looks for supplies while Beth goes to find some alcohol. Eventually she finds a bottle of wine, but is forced to destroy it when a walker pins her to the wall, making the bottle as a makeshift weapon. Daryl watches Beth kill the walker, and Beth sarcastically thanks him for his help. In one part of the club is a clothing store, and Beth takes a fresh change of clothes. Beth and Daryl find a dead woman staged as a mannequin with the sign "Rich Bitch" hanging from her neck. Beth asked Daryl to help her put the woman to rest in peace, and after being persuaded, Daryl finally help Beth by covering the woman with a blanket. Suddenly, the grandfather clock they encountered earlier rings and the two run towards a dead end while being chased by walkers. Daryl ferociously clubs the walkers to death with a golf club while Beth hid behind him, and he accidentally splashes walker blood on Beth's new shirt. The two later find the bar as well as a bottle of Peach Schnapps. Beth asks if it's good, but Daryl said no. He breaks a picture frame containing a map and plays with a dart board while Beth looks for a glass. She cries and Daryl smashes the bottle, saying that it won't do for a first drink.

Daryl leads Beth to a shack he found with Michonne and brings out some moonshine. Beth hesitates due to the supposed effects of moonshine, but Daryl pours her a glass anyway. She drinks some, and is disgusted by the taste; nevertheless, she pours another for herself and one for Daryl. Later on, she teaches Daryl the drinking game 'I never'. Daryl asked Beth is she's ever played it before, but she said she's never played it, and only watched her friends playing the game. He plays the game and reveals several stories but Beth accidentally angers him during her turn while saying she never went to jail. After taking a piss against the wall nonchalantly, Daryl goes berserk, starts yelling, and smashing jugs, attracting a walker outside. He sarcastically screamed at her that he never had a frozen yogurt, never had a pet pony, never had a present from Santa, never sung in front of a big group like it was a game, and never slit his wrist to gain attention, which makes Beth angry. He drags Beth outside and (due to her saying she never shot a crossbow before) begins to drunkenly teach her. After he haphazardly shoots several arrows at the walker, Beth stabs it in the head and the two have a fight. Beth yells at Daryl and told him not to just shrug off everything they have went through like it was nothing, and yells at him for thinking that she's just another dead girl. She told him that Daryl can feel emotions like her as well when Sophia and her mom came out of the barn. Daryl lashes out at her, saying she didn't feel a thing when two of her boyfriends died, and told her that she's naïve for thinking that they're going to see the others again. However, he eventually breaks down and cries, blaming himself for Hershel's death while Beth hugs him from behind. That night while the moonshine wears off, the two of them share stories about their past. Daryl tells Beth a story about his family and Merle, and said that he misses him. Beth admits that she envisioned a normal happy life for herself, Hershel, Maggie, Glenn and everyone else at the Prison. She also told Daryl how she misses Shawn, Annette, Hershel, and Maggie. She acknowledges that she doesn't have the skills necessary to survive and will probably be dead soon. Daryl tries to say otherwise, but Beth knows it to be true while he will most likely be "the last man standing", also advising him to be who he is right now, not who he was. She then suggests they both should burn the building down; Daryl goes inside, saying they need more booze. They empty all the jugs and light a wad of money Daryl found. As the cabin burns, they flip it off and leave into the night.



"
Alone
"


Beth is first seen using Daryl's crossbow and practicing tracking skills. She said that she's getting good at hunting and tracking, and jokingly said that sooner or later she won't need Daryl to protect her anymore. She finds a walker feasting, however, before she can kill the walker, she gets her foot caught in a trap, alerting the walker. Beth fires the crossbow, but it doesn't pierce the brain, and she is saved by Daryl. Daryl takes her via piggyback to a nearby graveyard, where Beth sees a grave with the inscription, "beloved father", reminding her of Hershel. Daryl picks up some wildflowers and places them on top of the grave. She then holds Daryl's hand. At the funeral home, Beth and Daryl find a funeral parlor with walkers dressed up in suits and placed in coffins and on mortuary tables. Beth says it's a beautiful thing to do because the people who cared for the dead bodies still remembered that walkers were once people. Daryl and Beth check the kitchen and find that the shelves are stocked with foods which have no dust, and Daryl determines that someone else is using the funeral home for themselves. Beth believes that there are still good people who survived until now, and Daryl says they will only take half the food for themselves, leaving the rest. At night, Beth is singing and playing a piano beside a coffin, and Daryl listened to her from behind, which startles her. Daryl then decides to sleep inside the coffin beside the piano, and tells Beth to keep singing and playing the piano. She seems amazed and comments that she thought he was annoyed by her singing. She then continues to sing and play the piano as a goodnight song for Daryl.

The next morning, Daryl carries Beth into the kitchen. Suddenly, they hear the cans tied to the porch rattle as if a walker has come up. Daryl opens the door and sees a one-eyed dog barking and wagging its tail. As Daryl reaches to pet it, it runs away. At night, Beth writes a thank you note for the people in the house. Daryl said she shouldn't because they should stay here a little longer. Beth asked why and thought that Daryl finally believes that there are still good people out there. She asked him why he changed his mind and is somewhat surprised when she realizes that she has had an impact on him, after all. They then hear more rattling and the dog barking outside. Daryl goes to the door and opens it believing that the dog wants in, only to have a herd of walkers attempt to barge in. Daryl instructs Beth to run outside and meet him on the road while he distract the walkers. But when Daryl finally makes it outside he sees Beth's bag on the ground with the contents scattered and a black car with a white cross painted on the back windshield speeding off. Beth is believed to have been kidnapped and taken to a hospital in an unknown location.

Beth appears in this episode through flashbacks from the beginning of Season 4, where she is seen holding Judith at the prison. Hershel is telling Rick that Beth will be taking care of Judith for the day and then Beth said good morning to Rick, reaches for Judith and walks away. In the present time, when Rick and Daryl talk the morning after the fight with the Marauders, Daryl mentions that he was with Beth for a while after the prison attack. Rick asks if she died and he states "She's just gone." Once again in another flashback, Beth is seen with Patrick, Carl and Judith. She is holding Judith while watching Patrick play with Legos and Carl putting a gun together. The final flashback of the episode is outside in the prison yard where Hershel, Rick, and Carl are digging holes for planting as Beth and Judith watch. Carl dropped his hat while digging and Rick puts his sheriff's hat on Beth and jokingly says that she's the new sheriff in town. He compliments her that it looks good on her and says he wants things to stay the way they are.

Slabtown
"


Beth wakes up in 
Grady Memorial Hospital
 in 
Atlanta
. Since Beth has no idea where she is, she grabs the IV attached to her arm and prepares to defend herself as the small group of survivors walk into her room. Beth is greeted and informed of her whereabouts, as well as being told what happened and her injuries by 
Dawn Lerner
 and 
Dr. Steven Edwards
. Dawn coldly says to Beth, "So you owe us". This means that Beth has to pay back, as she has taken from others. Beth soon finds herself paying off these "debts" by assisting Edwards on his rounds, and doing general jobs, such as cleaning. Edwards tells her of the group's history and guides her through many of the community's amenities and pitfalls. After a new patient, 
Gavin Trevitt
, is wheeled in, Beth is instructed to help Edwards. After Dawn finds out that Trevitt will not make it, she furiously slaps Beth in anger. Beth is left bleeding. Beth is targeted by 
Gorman
, whom she met earlier and is the one who took her to the hospital, ultimately wanting her as a sex slave. She is left to endure his sexual advances until Edwards steps in to defend her. Soon after, a new patient is brought in who tried to escape the hospital due to getting raped numerous times, named 
Joan
, who has been bitten. Beth holds her down as her arm is amputated to prevent infection. As Beth gets herself a clean shirt, she is greeted by 
Noah
. She and Noah instantly form a good friendship. Beth unwittingly injects Trevitt with Clozapine, which kills him. An angry Dawn demands to know what happened, and Noah lies and takes the blame. He is beaten by Dawn and Beth is left upset. Dawn later tells Beth that she knew that it was Beth's fault, and lied to protect the hospital's stability. She tells Beth that she isn't strong enough for this world, to which Beth confidently replies, "I am strong." She and Noah both create a plan to escape the hospital.      

Beth sneaks into Dawn's office and finds a deceased Joan behind Dawn's desk, who had committed suicide. She takes the key to the elevator shaft from Dawn's drawer. At this point, Gorman walks in on her and gives her an offer for him to keep a lid on her theft, in return for her to be controlled by him in a sexual context. As he pushes himself against her, Beth takes advantage of Joan's reanimation, and hits Gorman over the head with a glass jar, where he fell to the ground, resulting in Joan eating him. Beth takes his gun and leaves. Noah and Beth sneak down the elevator shaft, and are faced with walkers at the bottom. Beth shoots and kills all of these walkers and heads outside, to which she has to face many more. She kills and pushes enough of them out of the way in order to escape. As she runs, She is taken down by an officer. Only Noah got away. Beth is beaten by Dawn as punishment, and also because she told Dawn that nobody is coming to rescue them, which angers her. Sometime later, Edwards tends to her injuries. Beth confronts Edwards over Trevitt. She says that she knew that Edwards knew what he was doing, and purposely told her to give Trevitt the wrong medicine in order to deliberately kill him because he was also a doctor, and by having him alive, it threatened Edward's position and Dawn wouldn't protect as well as value him any longer. Edwards admits these accusations and replies by telling Beth that he did it to save his life. As Edwards walks out of the room, Beth grabs some scissors and prepares to murder Edwards for his shocking actions. Suddenly, she sees Carol being brought in on a stretcher, which changes her mind, as Carol will need Edwards help in order to survive. Beth looks on, worried and shocked.     



"
Crossed
"


At the hospital, Beth listens into Dawn and 
O'Donnell
's conversation about the patient in exam room 2 (Carol). It is discussed between the two about Carol's fate. Dawn soon makes the decision to switch off the machines that are keeping Carol stable. Beth interrupts and insists that this was a bad thing to do, and it remains unknown to the hospital survivors that Beth and Carol knew each other. After Beth has unsuccessfully tried to talk around the pair, Dawn tells her that she had just killed the patient. Dawn then admits that she was wrong about Beth being weak, then handing her the drug locker key and tells her to get the medicine to save Carol.

Later, Beth heads over to Dr. Steven Edwards office and demands he tells her the suitable medicine for the patient in exam room 2. He stutters and then gives her a straight answer. She hatches a plan which involves having another ex-patient pretend to choke. Whilst officers assist the elderly patient, Beth grabs the meds to then immediately return to Carol's bedside and prepare the drugs, using strawberries as a bribery tool. Beth holds Carol's hand with a worried look on her face, and tells an unconscious Carol: "I just wanted you to know that I was here".

Beth is cleaning Dawn's office while she tries to reach her officers on the radio. She finds a photo of her and Hanson, and Dawn tells her that he was her mentor and friend and explains what happened to him.

Beth watches as O'Donnell berates Percy for not properly stitching a hole in his sleeve and shoves him to the ground. He is about to call Beth over but Dawn arrives and leads her away.

Beth sits on the edge of the elevator shaft when Dawn appears. Beth tells Dawn the world isn't going to magically get better, and Dawn says that the other cops don't know that she got Gorman and Jeffries killed. O'Donnell walks in and threatens Dawn, saying that she should tell the other officers or he will. The two begin to fight, and when Beth tries to break them up, O'Donnell shoves her to the ground. Dawn regains the advantage and calls for Beth, who gets to her feet and shoves him down the shaft. Dawn thanks her.

Beth is sitting against the wall in Carol's hospital room when Dawn arrives. Dawn tells her it's okay to cry, but Beth says she doesn't cry anymore. Beth tells her she only covered for her to protect herself, and insists she's going to leave just like Noah. Dawn says that Noah will be back "as they always do". She reveals that she knows Beth knows Carol, and that they both should stay.

Later, Beth gets changed into her old clothes and hides a pair of scissors in her cast. She wheels Carol into a hallway with Dawn and her officers, where Rick and the others arrive. They trade the two hostage officers for Carol and Beth, and are about to leave when Dawn demands that Noah stay. She and Rick begin to argue until Noah volunteers to stay. Beth is unhappy and goes over to hug Noah, and Dawn whispers "I knew you'd be back." Beth approaches Dawn so they are face to face, and says "I get it now" before stabbing her in the shoulder with the scissors. In shock, Dawn accidentally shoots Beth in the head as both groups look on in horror. Dawn protests that she didn't mean to kill Beth, but Daryl pulls out his gun and shoots Dawn in the head.

As the rest of the group arrive at the hospital, Maggie breaks down as Daryl carries Beth's body outside.

 and 
Lizzie
 and 
Mika
, but Tyreese is antagonized by 
Martin
