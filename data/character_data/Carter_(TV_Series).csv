,,,"Carter is a man of good-intentions, but his lack of experience outside the walls of 
Alexandria
 makes him an unfit leader. He is shown to not be combat-proficient as he is unable to defend himself against walkers. He is initially skeptical of 
Rick
's leadership and believes that he will get everyone killed. He attempts to stage a coup to overthrow Rick. However, when Rick finds out about this, Carter attempts to take the blame saying it was all him. Rick decides to spare his life. He takes part in Rick's plan to deter a mega herd of walkers. Seeing that the plan is working, Carter grows to respect Rick as a leader and admits that he was right.",Nothing is known about Carter's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, Carter joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where, upon being interviewed by 
Deanna
, he was appointed as a member of the construction crew. He also helped 
Reg
 build the walls surrounding the community in the first months.
Over time, Carter aided his crew in gathering materials from a nearby mall construction site to be used for the upcoming expansion of the community's walls, which lasted for around eight weeks.
Carter attends the meeting at Deanna's house regarding how to handle the mega herd at the quarry where he expresses his concerns about 
Rick
's plan, while accusing him of his 
erratic behavior
 days earlier, before being forced to accept it on Deanna's orders. However, still angry at Rick's presence in the community, he organizes a secret meeting a few days later with 
Olivia
, 
Spencer
, 
Francine
, and 
Tobin
 with the intention of exiling him from Alexandria. When 
Eugene
 is caught spying on them, Carter tries to cover up the complot by killing him when suddenly Rick, 
Daryl
, and 
Morgan
 enter the pantry after hearing noise and Rick reduces Carter to his knees but eventually decides to spare him after hearing his pathetic pleas.
In the following days, Carter is among the volunteers to help build the wall on one of the roads to deter the mega herd in the operation to lure it away from Alexandria. One day as they are in mid-construction, he and the other Alexandrians are almost bitten by walkers until 
Morgan
 saves them after ignoring 
Rick
's suggestion of forcing the scared residents to learn how to defend themselves. When the plan is set into motion and works successfully, he realizes that Rick was right and makes peace with him. While running through the forest alone to check the north side of the herd, Carter is surprised by a lone walker and is bitten in the cheek. As he starts screaming in shock, Rick arrives and stabs him in order to 
end his suffering
 and to not attract any walkers.","Killed By
Zombies
 
(Caused)
While Carter is rushing to the front of the herd, a stray walker grabs him and bites him on the cheek. He begins screaming out of sheer pain and visceral fear and by doing so attracts more walkers.

(Out of Mercy)
Out of mercy
 and necessity, Rick is forced to stab him through the back of his head to stop him from screaming, and to relieve him of his suffering.","This list shows the victims Carter has killed:

First Time Again
""","The casting call for this character used the name 
Tucker
.

Carter was described as ""Mid 30s. A hardworking man with tough fairness. He's a guy who can also be articulate and feel like a leader. When push comes to shove, he's willing to take extreme measures to protect what he has, even if it gets him in over his head.""


Carter is the first character to die in 
Season 6
.


Ethan Embry's character was first revealed at the San Diego Comic Con in June 2015 and had a few lines in the Season 6 trailer.


On July 29, 2015, his character was officially revealed: ""Gimple says Carter serves as a composite of different people from the original comic. “Ethan plays a combo of a few characters that we actually haven't hit yet or weren't able to hit in other characters,” says Gimple. “He is an Alexandrian, and has been there the whole time, just quite busy.” From the looks of the season 6 trailer that was released at Comic-Con, Carter now looks like he'll be busy trying to turn the community against Rick for all the violence that has come to town. We'll see how that pans out for him.""
