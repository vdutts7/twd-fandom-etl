Militia
, Alice becomes an orphan and remains living in the 
Sanctuary
. When the community eventually falls, she is adopted by 
Frankie
 and they move to Alexandria.
Alice is among the Alexandrian children to enjoy the bonfire with 
Winnie
, 
Linus
, 
P.J.
, and the other kids from 
Jocelyn
's 
group
. She attends a sleepover at the house Jocelyn and her kids are staying at when in the middle of the night, they all leave Alexandria under the guise of playing a game. In reality, Alice and the other Alexandrian children, including 
Judith
, 
Jonah
, and 
Marcus
, are kidnapped and brought to an abandoned school.
When 
Michonne
 and 
Daryl
 arrive at the school to rescue the children that dawn, they are rushed by Jocelyn's group members into a trailer, with 
Mitchell
 ordering Winnie to kill them all. Fortunately, none of the Alexandrian kids are hurt and they are brought safely back to Alexandria. Upon arriving home, Alice is hugged by her 
mother

Kingdom

""Let the fair of a new beginning begin!""
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. At the fair, Alice enjoys a candy apple and walks around with other young women as they explore and enjoy the fair.

Henry
 and ask if he is looking for someone. 
""I hope you find them!""
 Frankie tells him as he continues his way around the fair. When her mother goes missing, Alice and
