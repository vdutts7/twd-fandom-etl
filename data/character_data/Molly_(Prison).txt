Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Molly's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse


Season 4


"
30 Days Without An Accident
"


While Daryl and Carol talk in the dining pavilion, Molly can be seen eating breakfast with 
another girl
. Molly is later seen playing with 
Lizzie
, 
Mika
, and 
Luke
 in the 
prison
 yard, naming the 
walkers
. After 
Carl
 confronts the kids and tells them to stop naming walkers, Molly follows Luke and Lizzie to the library, where she is later seen listening to 
Carol
 at story time, which turns into a knife lesson.



"
Infected
"


As an outbreak occurs in Cell Block D that left several people killed and reanimated, Molly attempts to flee downstairs to safety. She is saved by Carol and is rushed into a cell with 
Karen
, 
David
, 
Luke
, and another 
girl
 where they are safe and wait out until the reanimated residents are put down.



"
Isolation
"


Though unseen, Molly was moved to the Administrative Building as it was mentioned that the children and elderly were moved into this building as a part of the quarantine.



"
Too Far Gone
"


After the watch tower is blown up by the Governor, the prison residents are told to evacuate to the bus. Luke carries a bag of supplies and follows Molly and Mika, who are carrying Judith, as they head for the bus when Lizzie stops them and tells the group to be strong like Carol told them to, and not to be scared and weak. A short time later, after the bus was forced to leave before everyone could board, Luke and Molly go out into the prison yard alongside Lizzie and Mika, and 
one of the Governor‚Äôs men
 is shot and killed by Lizzie. After his death, Luke turns around and runs back into the prison, followed by Molly. Lizzie then executes 
Alisha
, and runs back after Luke and Molly into the prison with 
Mika
, despite 
Tyreese
‚Äòs attempt to tell them they‚Äôre fleeing in the wrong direction. 



"
Inmates
"


Beth and Daryl come across several bodies beside the train tracks being eaten by walkers. Beth sees a child's shoe, and assumes them to be the bodies of Molly and Luke.

Trivia


In "
Inmates
", Beth and Daryl find children‚Äôs footprints in the woods, and Beth speculates they may belong to Luke or Molly. After finding the corpses and a bloody child‚Äôs shoe at the train tracks, Beth breaks down in tears, believing the children may have been killed.


While it was never confirmed, Luke Donaldson mentioned in an interview that people had speculated that Luke and Molly may have been siblings, and that they had come from Woodbury with the remaining townspeople after the failed prison assault (neither filmed for Season 3).
