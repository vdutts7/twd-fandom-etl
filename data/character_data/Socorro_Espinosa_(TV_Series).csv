Rosita was a soldier and Siddiq was the community doctor for Alexandria. While Rosita was in a committed relationship with Gabriel Stokes , Alexandria's priest, she had a brief affair with Siddiq and conceived Coco in August 2020. After Coco's birth, she was raised by Rosita, Gabriel, and Siddiq. Also assisting in her physical examinations and childcare was Eugene Porter , community engineer and longtime friend to Rosita. Three months after being born, Coco is taken care of by her family and Eugene. Later that day, Coco is taken by Siddiq to his house and is put to sleep. However, Siddiq starts having flashbacks and wakes up his daughter. He then holds Coco to calm her down. Coco is strolled by Rosita and Gabriel around the streets over the night. The following morning, Coco is alongside her mother at the dining hall enjoying a meal. Coco spends the day with her father. She is carried by him when he visits the infirmary to check on the sick patients and later when he goes to Rosita's house to look for change Coco's clothes. Later that day, Coco is brought again by Siddiq to the infirmary as he takes a sick Rosita to be treated. That night, Siddiq holds Coco and falls sleep. He starts to dream of the harrowing night at the barn and wakes up to find himself holding Coco atop the windmill much to his confusion. Coco is taken by Rosita when she goes to Siddiq's room to check on him but they are greeted by a suspicious Dante. Before a fight breaks out, she is put by her mother into a bathtub. When Coco starts crying by the noise, a reanimated Siddiq walks over to attack her. Before she can be harmed, Rosita saves her in time and then picks her up. The next day, Coco is carried by her mother during Siddiq's funeral. She is then taken home by Gabriel and is put to sleep. Later that day, Rosita carries Coco to a window and tells her she will grow strong and loved. Following Siddiq's death, Rosita starts to suffer from nightmares where she sees herself being killed by Whisperers and finds herself unable to move as Coco is the one being killed in a dream. Following Beta 's infiltration of Alexandria, Coco is left under Gabriel's care as Rosita decides to travel to Hilltop for medical care as she trusts her daughter with him acting as a paternal figure. Though unseen, Coco is among the residents to evacuate Alexandria and relocate to an abandoned hospital referred to as the "" Tower "" where she and dozens of others seek refuge on the upper floors of the hospital. As a group of survivors enact a plan to lure the herd away, others defend the hospital from the Whisperers and snipe as many as they can from the windows. When the Whisperers eventually break into the hospital, Coco and the others are evacuated safely from the hospital via the elevator shafts and basement tunnels. After Beta and the Whisperers are wiped out, the remaining survivors congregate in the woods where the injured are treated and families are reunited. Rosita takes Coco to see the horses that they bought back to Alexandria. Coco is upstairs in the house, as Rosita, Lydia and Dianne are killing walkers on the stairs. When Maggie's group arrives home, Rosita and Coco greet Gabriel. At the Halloween party, Rosita has dressed Coco up as a flower. Gabriel offers to look after her while Rosita attends orientation for the Commonwealth military. She tells Gabriel she will pick her up after her shift, but he offers to look after her overnight so Rosita can rest. Rosita takes Coco for a walk to the lake in her pram. Coco stays in the pram while Eugene and her mother talk. Coco and Rosita visit Gabriel in the church, where he is giving his last sermon before the group leaves the Commonwealth. Rosita puts Coco into her pram where she stays while her mother talks with Gabriel. Coco is heard screaming for help, when Rosita, Eugene & Gabriel come searching for her at the Commonwealth. She is placed under an overturned crib, while a walker attempts to claw its way in. Rosita comes in, killing the walkers and saving Coco. Later in the episode, Rosita straps Coco to her chest and begins to escape a surrounded ambulance. Rosita starts climbing a pipe on the side of a building, while walkers grab at her legs. All of a sudden, Rosita and Coco fall into the herd, disappearing from sight. Rosita reappears, slicing through the walkers, climbing the ambulance and jumping her & Coco to safety. When all seems well, Rosita is seen sitting with Coco. Eugene speaks to her about taking Coco to Oceanside next summer, so she can learn how to swim. Rosita reveals she's been bitten and wants to soak up every last moment she can with her daughter before she dies. At the end of the episode, we see Coco and Rosita are sitting at the dinner table enjoying Rosita's final meal. Right before she passes away, she kisses Coco on the head and whispers, before Gabriel takes her out the room. One year later, we see Coco is living at Alexandria, being raised by Gabriel.
