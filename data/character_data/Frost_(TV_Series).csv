Alden

Cole

Elijah

Gage
, 
Negan
, Agatha, Duncan, 
Roy
, and 
Gabriel
, the survivors utilize Negan's familiarity with the 
D.C.
 area to travel to 
Meridian
. Due to the heavy 
rainstorm
, the survivors are forced to head into the 
subway tunnels
 to complete the journey. While in the tunnels, they come across hundreds of body bags, many containing walkers in them. At some point, while dispatching the body bag walkers, Gage and Roy go missing, along with the group's ammo and supplies. Shortly after this realization, a large group of walkers appear, forcing the other survivors to move forward in the tunnel without being able to search for Gage or Roy. He is able to make it into a subway car before the walkers are able to catch up with his group.
Frost and the rest of the Meridian mission survivors make their way through the subway tunnels and successfully fight their way through the undead to safety, despite losing 
Gage
, who was killed after running away from the group and becoming separated. With the storm subsiding, Frost and the rest of the group traverse down a road when suddenly 
Roy
 is shot and killed and a flying knife severs Cole's hand clean. The Reapers have launched an ambush on the survivors.
After the Reapers attack his group, Frost attempts to defend himself and avoid getting killed. With the members fragmented into smaller groups, Frost is nowhere to be found.
After Daryl is captured by the Reapers, it is revealed that Frost was also captured by the Reapers and brought back to 
Meridian
. Frost is then tortured and interrogated by the Reapers. He attempts to get 
Daryl
 to say what happened to the others but Daryl shuts him down, saying he wants nothing to do with their fight. Frost, playing along, says his group should've let him starve, as he is taken away by the Reapers for more interrogation.
In Meridian, 
Carver
 tortures Frost and demands to know where his people are. Frost says nothing. 
Pope
 orders 
Daryl
 to take a turn interrogating Frost. Daryl puts Frost in a chokehold and orders him to give up his friends' location. Frost refuses. Daryl chops off Frost's finger and again demands to know the location of his friends. Frost finally reveals the 
location
 of the supply depot. Pope dispatches 
Leah
 to scout the location with a crew of Reapers. After they leave, Pope continued to interrogate Frost and got all the information he needed. After this, Pope tortured Frost to death. When Daryl and Leah return they see Frost tied to a post: he is now a walker.
While unseen, it can be assumed that either 
Maggie

Daryl

Gabriel
