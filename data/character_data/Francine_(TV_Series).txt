Overview
[
]


Francine starts as an inexperienced but feisty survivor. In her first scene, she gets injured after falling off her perch and becomes surrounded by walkers. She's saved by 
Abraham
 and the two work together to help clear out the walkers. She is shown to be surprisingly strong, punching 
Tobin
, a man much larger than her, hard enough to stagger him.

Francine is also shown to be quite cynical and pessimistic, as during 
Rick
's speech, she states that 
Alexandria
 is already a graveyard due to the numerous casualties they have suffered. However, she later gains the bravery and courage to join her fellow Alexandrians in taking out the massive herd in the community. After this, she becomes a soldier for the militia, fight valiantly against the 
Saviors
 until her demise.

Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse after experiencing a lot on her own, Francine joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where, upon being interviewed by 
Deanna
, she was appointed as a member of the construction crew.

Over time, Francine aided her crew in gathering materials from a nearby mall construction site to be used for the upcoming expansion of the community's walls, which lasted for around eight weeks.

Francine is on lookout duty at the Woodlands Mall construction site as her companions gather materials when the site is attacked by a herd. She falls out of the crate, injuring her leg, but is saved by 
Abraham
. Afterwards, she punches 
Tobin
 for having left her to die. Moments later, Francine remains working after Abraham starts leading the team.



"
Conquer
"
[
]


Francine is among the townspeople present at the community forum to discuss Rick's fate. She is seated next to 
Erin
 and listens to her fellow residents as they speak. Francine and the other residents are shocked when Rick suddenly arrives with the corpse of a walker as Tobin was speaking. She also witnesses the murder of 
Reg Monroe
, which she is horrified at, and the subsequent execution of 
Pete Anderson
.



Season 6
[

"
First Time Again
"
[

Francine attends the meeting at Deanna's house regarding how to handle the mega herd at the quarry. A few days later, she is at the armory with 
Olivia
, 
Spencer
, and Tobin, listening to 
Carter
's plan to kill 
Rick
 and take over Alexandria. Francine is hesitant and does not agree with Carter's ideas. When Rick discovers the complot, everyone accuses Carter of being the only one responsible. In the following days, Francine is among the volunteers to help build the wall on one of the roads to deter the mega herd in the operation to lure it away from Alexandria. When the walkers break free from the quarry and the plan is set into motion, Francine and the others take immediate action.



"
Now

Francine returns to Alexandria and listens to Rick and 
Aaron
 as they address the crowd. When Rick insists on making the community as silent as a graveyard, she claims that the town is already a graveyard.



"
No Way Out

[
]


Francine takes shelter inside one of the houses when the herd invades the community. That night, she witnesses Rick and other residents slaughtering walkers in the streets and is inspired to join the group where they battle the entire herd for hours until dawn when all the walkers are finally killed.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"
[
]


Francine is walking down the street when 
Carol
 appears and gives her a container of cookies. Later that morning, she is present at the meeting in the church, listening to Rick's speech about the danger of 
the Saviors
. When Rick asks if anyone objects to the idea of attacking the Saviors for supplies from the 
Hilltop Colony
, she remains silent.



"
Last Day on Earth
"
[
]


When Rick and the others leave in the RV to get 
Maggie
 medical care at the Hilltop, Francine and 
Scott
 close the gates and remain stationed on guard duty as they watch the group drive away.

"
Something They Need
"
[
]


When 
Tara
 reveals to Rick that she found a community named 
Oceanside
, Francine and her fellow Alexandrians travel to the community to gather guns from the armory. Upon arriving, they set up explosives outside the walls and assume positions among the trees. After the Oceansiders are herded, Francine and the others dispatch a herd of walkers drawn to the site. Afterwards, she helps collect the weapons from the armory and prepares to return to Alexandria. 



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"
[
]


Francine is stationed at the front of Alexandria, crouching on the platform with Aaron, 
Eric
, and Tobin. When the bombs fail to detonate, the 
Scavengers
 take everyone in Alexandria hostage. After 
Carl
 opens fire on several Scavengers, she joins the battle against the Scavengers and the Saviors alongside her fellow Alexandrians until reinforcements from Hilltop and the 
Kingdom
 arrive to the rescue. After the Saviors and Scavengers retreat from Alexandria, Francine attends 
Sasha
's funeral and listens on at the leaders' speech.

"
Mercy
"
[
