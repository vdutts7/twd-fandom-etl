Overview


During the first season, Carl is portrayed as a shy and reserved boy, only striking up a conversation with his parents and members of the group with whom he feels comfortable, such as 
Shane Walsh
, 
Dale Horvath
, and 
Sophia Peletier
. Carl, being relatively young, is shown to often be frightened by the horrors of the world, thus looking to his parents for shelter and comfort. Carl is a kind boy who tries his best to comfort those closest to him when he recognizes that they are in need.

In the second season, Carl retains his shyness, but he develops a bolder personality and is seen to be less frightened of the world in response to the many ordeals he has experienced. He attempts to take on a more active role, wanting to help out the group, rather than be known as a liability; he finds the arsenal of knives for the group, and he helps with the search for Sophia. Like most children at his age, he is sometimes disobedient, but he shows shame and guilt when his actions negatively impact the group.

After accidentally being shot by 
Otis
, Carl is stricken with negative thoughts. He develops the desire to fend for himself and also to prove his independence and maturity. This is especially prevalent when he accompanies the adults in gun training. After his friend Sophia is found zombified in the barn, he begins to form a noticeably colder personality, mentioning that he would have put Sophia down himself. In addition, he follows his father into the barn to watch him execute 
Randall
, and he even eggs Rick on to do the act. Carl is occasionally pessimistic and rude. He also insults Carol for speaking of heaven. Despite this, he is not above apologizing and realizes that some of his words and actions are unacceptable.

After Carl indirectly causes the death of 
Dale Horvath
, he is overcome with immense guilt, thinking himself a failure and vowing never to touch a gun again; his growing boldness was an attempt to prove himself worthy of standing alongside the adults of he group. It is not until his father talks to him privately in the barn that his confidence is restored, and Dale's death becomes a lesson. After putting down Shane, Carl finally notices that he will have to mature in order to survive in the new world.

By the third season, Carl has become battle-hardened from months on the road. His firearm skills have greatly improved, as well as his tactical abilities. He is no longer shy around most of the group, which is assumed to be a result of spending months with them out on the open road. Despite Carl's increase in capability, he does not appear to be completely immune to emotion, and he retains some of his child-like qualities, such as cracking a joke every now and then, as well as developing a child-like crush on 
Beth Greene
.

However, after witnessing Lori's death, delivering his baby sister, and taking it upon himself to put his mother down, his despondent attitude amplifies. Carl goes through a stage of depression, neglecting to speak much unless he feels that it is necessary. He even tells his father to temporarily step down from his leadership position. Despite the traumatic impact that his mother's death has on him, it hardens him immensely. He becomes very brave, frequently helping people and risking his own life to save others; he saves 
Michonne
 outside the gates and his father from a hostile 
Morgan Jones
, despite his father's pleading to stay back.

Throughout the course of the season, Carl begins to unwind as a result of the brutality of the world with the 
Governor
 at the center. Thinking he doing what is necessary to protect the group, Carl mercilessly kills a young boy as the boy was surrendering, which makes known how ruthless he has turned. Rick, frightened of what he has allowed his son to become due to being a relatively inactive parent, spends more time with Carl. He encourages him to pursue other endeavors, such as farming.

By the fourth season, Carl has become much more relaxed and accepts the fact that there is more to life than survival. Rick has taken his parental role more seriously and is stricter towards Carl. Although he still yearns for more excitement and is concerned with the possibility of the Governor's survival, Carl understands what his father is trying to do for him and tries to honor his father's wishes by attempting to be a kid again. Of course, he finds this difficult because of the many tragedies he has encountered and all the morbid things he has done. Despite his now more nonchalant personality, he still retains his more serious and realistic viewpoint on the world, such as chastising 
Lizzie Samuels
 and the other children for naming the walkers and for falsely believing that they are not so different from the living. Carl's maturity and his worthiness ultimately earn him his gun back, which he accepts honorably. Rick is confident in Carl's ability to use the weapon decisively. 

Despite Carl being young, he is not hesitant to call out his seniors when he believes that they are doing something illogical. Perhaps the most notable instance is when he tells 
Hershel Greene
 that he is not going to allow him to go into the woods alone, and also when he informs Rick that 
Carol Peletier
 should be permitted to teach the children of the group how to defend themselves. Throughout the course of the first half of the season, Carl gradually becomes more integrated into the defense of the 
prison
, even fighting beside his father to stop a large horde of walkers, which Carl recognizes was a tough thing for Rick to allow. By the time of the prison's fall, Carl is severely shook up, most probably due to the loss of the prison, the decapitation of Hershel, and the presumed death of Judith.

During the second half of the fourth season, Carl struggles to come to terms with what has happened. Scarred from the battle and subsequent loss of the prison, he is recurrently seen to have outbursts of intense anger and frustration, sometimes resembling meltdowns. Driven by a need to pin his anger on something, he directs his rage toward his injured father. Upon Michonne's return, they accept the fact that Carl is becoming an adult in the new world. At the end of the season, Carl reveals to Michonne that he has dark thoughts in his head that he fears would jeopardize his relationship with his father. he believes that he isn't what Rick thinks he is, and that he is a monster.

In the fifth season, Carl's mental state improves significantly. After the escape from 
Terminus
, he begins taking on an adult role in the group. Carl helps with the fortification and defense of the church, as well as taking responsibility for protecting baby Judith. He seems to have cooled down a bit in terms of his emotional and mental stability, as evidenced by his ability to laugh and smile but is still capable of fearlessness and even a degree of coldness. He shows his fearless disposition when confronted with 
Gareth
 and the other surviving cannibals, and tries to teach Father 
Gabriel Stokes
 how to use a weapon. This attitude makes him potentially dangerous, as he is able to do what is necessary to survive. However, he seems to remain in control of his emotional state. He also appears as though to have grown more optimistic in the events following the fall of the prison and escape from Terminus; he immediately implores the group, particularly his father, to save Gabriel when he hears his desperate cries for help and expresses his belief that not everyone in the world can be bad, even when Rick is warning him that he is never safe.

After the events at 
Grady Memorial Hospital
, Carl interacts with members of the group with maturity and kindness on the road, including giving a grieving Maggie a gift. The group finds it difficult to survive in the wilderness, and Rick becomes concerned about how Carl is coping, but Glenn assures him that Carl bounces back quicker than any of them. Rick says that kids like Carl are lucky because they can adapt to and inherit the new world.

After entering 
Alexandria
, Carl, again, grows fairly sullen, worried that the community will make him weak and dulled to survival. Although he likes the people and enjoys living in large houses, he finds dealing with the other adolescents in the 
community
 rather complicated, though he eventually decides that he ought to make friends rather than live in isolation with his outsider group. He becomes fascinated with a withdrawn teenage girl called 
Enid
, who also came in from the outside, and with whom he forms a bond.

In the sixth season, Carl continues to mature. He offers Gabriel lessons on how to use weapons and gives him advice on how to reintegrate after his betrayal of the group. Carl did this when few others would have anything to do with Gabriel. Carl often cares for Judith and even helps Enid during the 
Wolves
' attack. He also attempts to help 
Ron Anderson
, another teen of the community, learn how to adapt, but Ron refuses, revealing his hostility toward Carl due to Rick's execution of 
Pete
, his father. In return, Carl becomes more adverse and somewhat insensible toward Ron. During the 
herd attack
 on Alexandria, Ron pulls a gun on Carl, telling him that there is no hope and that everyone is already dead. Carl, displaying his now optimistic and more mature state of mind, disagrees and ensures Ron that there is still hope. Covered in walker guts, the group steps outside into the herd, and Carl hides Judith underneath his cut-up bed sheet and looks on through the herd, exhibiting his sophistication and bravery.

After Carl gets shot through the eye by Ron and spends the next two months rehabilitating from the incident, Carl seemingly appears to remain normal, showing his usual smile to his loved ones, but it becomes increasingly clear that this is a crudely put up façade at best and that Carl is absolutely not okay. He presents a noticeably rougher edge when his loved ones aren't around such as when he's with Enid, and this rough edge has been noticed by his father. He tends to try and avoid conversation with people he'd usually be happy to talk to such as with Michonne and he's shown to be rather depressed, even when he's babysitting Judith, something he'd usually be a lot more upbeat about. A comment Carl makes to his father could even hint that he's feeling self-conscious about his own appearance which is reinforced by Rick's taken-aback reaction of hurt.

More important 
and
 worrying though is that Carl appears to be developing a taste for bloodshed. While initially unnoticeable, he shows some worrying traits when he interacts with threats for the first time since suffering his eye injury. Enid suggests that the reason Carl is joining the journey to the 
Hilltop Colony
 with an ailing Maggie is because he wants to run into the 
Saviors
 to make them suffer, and the reaction Carl gives is all she needed to confirm this suspicion. This is quite different from S3 where, even though he was walking down a darker path he was still only killing because he thought he had to, not because he wanted to. Even Rick has noticed this and seems quite worried about his son's new attitude.

Unlike his father and the majority of the group, Carl was completely unshaken by the Saviors' attempts to antagonize him, zoning out in a trance a couple of times, and glaring wordlessly at 
Negan
 when face to face, impressing Negan who refers to Carl as a future serial killer. This and Enid's comments suggest that Carl could be developing a more sadistic side. However, when he was alone with Negan in Negan's room in the Sanctuary, and after being forced to take off his bandage and show his exposed eye socket, Carl was shown to be visibly afraid when forced to sing while Negan swung Lucille around. This shows how self-conscious Carl has become about his appearance, as well as the fact that he is actually afraid of Negan and the Saviors. After noticing this, Negan expresses genuine remorse for his treatment of Carl.

During the preparation for the war against Negan and the Saviors, Carl continued to show his more mature side, no longer going against his father's wishes. He showed his bravery, and willing to fight, when he was the first one to fight 
the Scavengers
 when they held Alexandria at gunpoint and were distracted by Negan being attacked. Carl was even put in charge of safeguarding Alexandria while the Militia wages war with the Saviors, despite the presence of natural-born leaders such as Michonne and Rosita, a responsibility he took extremely seriously and achieved when he orchestrated Alexandria's evacuation during the Savior's bombardment on the community.

While everyone else during the war focuses on the present battles and bloodshed, Carl develops a more progressive way of thinking when contemplating the aftermath of the war and the future.

After his death, Carl continues to have a lasting impact upon those who knew him. His dreams of a better future have an enormous impact on Rick who works to make them come true after the defeat of the Saviors. Carl's words also cause Rick to spare Negan and make peace with the defeated Saviors, recalling Carl's constant reminders to Rick that they will have to live with their former enemies once the war is over. Negan, who genuinely cared for the boy, is devastated by his loss as well and over the years of his imprisonment in Alexandria, shares stories with Judith about her brother, forming a close bond with the young girl. Judith ends up adopting Carl's signature hat as a part of her own look which had been passed on to Judith just before Carl's death. Following in Carl's footsteps, Judith eventually passes the hat on to their little brother 
R.J.




Pre-Apocalypse


King County, Georgia


Carl was born in 1998 and grew up in King County, where he experienced an average childhood raised by his father, 
Rick Grimes
 (a sheriff deputy) alongside his mother 
Lori
 (a housewife). The three lived together as a typical family in a single-story house in King County, Georgia. He also befriended his father's closest friend, 
Shane Walsh
.
[2]
 When Carl was 3 years old, Rick took him on a walk to Ross' farm, where Carl became grateful for the safety and happiness his father provided him.   

When Carl was in the third grade, he had a best friend whom was allergic to dairy products and thus brought in soy-based meals for lunchtime; one day Carl tasted his friend's milk and almost vomited (which became a humorous memory for him).
[3]
 As he grew, he developed a keen interest in playing video games and reading comic books.
[4]
[5]


Over time however, his parents' marriage became increasingly strained due to their marital issues and Carl was often in the presence of his parents quarrels, where one day, Carl witnessed Lori questioning if Rick truly cared about his family, an incident which affected Carl to a degree.

"
Days Gone Bye
"


In a 
camp
 outside the city, a group of survivors, among them Carl, Lori and 
Shane
, receive Rick's transmission. However, Carl doesn't recognize Rick's voice over the garbled transmission. 
Amy
 runs to the 
CB
, but can't get a reply. By the time Shane takes over the CB controls and introduces himself, Rick has left the emergency broadcast channel.

Lori voices that she's been saying for a week that they should put signs up on the highway warning people away from the city, and volunteers to go on her own, but 
Dale
 and Shane argue that venturing out is too risky. Lori walks off and Shane goes after her, telling Carl that everything is fine. Inside her tent, Shane tells Lori that she needs to keep it together for Carl, who has lost so much already. Lori agrees and they kiss passionately, before Carl interrupts them, not seeing them kissing. Lori promises him she's not going anywhere and tells her son to go finish his chores, prompting him to run off smiling.



"
Guts
"


In the camp, Carl is playing with cars in the dirt when Lori tells him to stay where Dale can see him as she goes into the forest to pick up mushrooms. 

Shane is teaching Carl how to tie knots. Suddenly, the radio crackles and squeaks, and T-Dog's garbled transmission comes through, explaining that they're trapped in the department store, surrounded by hundreds of walkers. Carl follows his mother and Shane, running closer as Dale responds to the transmission but only radio silence follows. He stays quiet, letting the grown ups talk, but looks worried. He then watches his mother follow after Amy to comfort her. Shane walks over to him and ruffles his hair. 



"
Tell It to the Frogs
"


Carl is first seen with his mother and is fussing as she gives him a haircut. Shane bonds with Carl and tells him in playful manner: "
You think this is bad, wait till you start shaving. That stings. That day comes, you'll be wishing for one of your mama's haircuts. I'll tell you what: you just get through this with some manly dignity and tomorrow I'll teach you something special. I will teach you to catch frogs.
" Carl laughs. As Carl and the rest of the group hear the roaring alarm of a car that 
Glenn Rhee
 is driving towards the camp from Atlanta, they all approach it with caution. Morales, another member of the group on the Atlanta run, is reunited with his family, while Carl begins to cry under the realization that he'll never see his father again, and Lori comforts him. As it happens, Rick was rescued in Atlanta by the group; when he exits the van, Carl sees him and runs toward him in tears. Rick picks him up, embracing him.

Later that night, Carl is seen around the campfire with everybody else as Rick shares his story. The next day, Carl is heard screaming out for his parents shortly after encountering a walker eating a deer in the woods. Shortly after, Carl nods in understanding after being told that his father needs to go back for 
Merle Dixon
, whom Rick left handcuffed on a rooftop. Later that day, Lori tries to comfort Carl, and she tells him that Rick will be fine, despite her being worried herself about him, to which Carl responds: "
Think about it, Mom. Everything that's happened to him so far-- nothing's killed him yet.
" Toward the end of the episode, Carl is seen playing with Shane as Shane teaches him how to catch frogs. Shortly after, Lori tells Carl to stay away from Shane and tells Carl that it does not matter what Shane says, for Shane told her that Rick had died.



"
Vatos
"


Carl is seen around the survivors' camp talking some of the other camp members. He asks 
Amy
 and 
Andrea
 if they could teach him to fish, after having been impressed by the amount they were able to catch. He later joins the group to learn why 
Jim
 is digging holes. Lori tells Jim that he is scaring Carl and Sophia. Jim brings up an uncomfortable topic to Carl, as he asks him about Rick. At the end of the same day, he joins the group for dinner around the camp-fire. The walkers suddenly attack the camp and kill many of the survivors. Carl survives the attack, and Rick then returns to camp with the bag of guns. Carl embraces his father, crying.



"
Wildfire
"


Just after the walker attack, Carl can be seen resting. Carl is still sad that his father left and asks him if they are safe now that they are together, to which Rick responds: "
I won't leave again. I promise you that. Not for anything. Now give me a chance to discuss some things with your mom, okay?
" Carl later joins the group in their plan to leave the camp and head for the 
CDC
. He says goodbye to the Morales' family, and they all leave the camp. He is later seen with the others as they arrive at the CDC.



"
TS-19
"


Carl is welcomed into the CDC by the only remaining scientist, Dr. 
Edwin Jenner
, along with the rest of the group. He takes a blood test shortly before he is seen with the others laughing and enjoying a fine meal. The others entreat Carl to taste the wine, and he cringes in disgust after taking a sip. He later plays checkers with Sophia and then heads to bed. Toward the end of the episode, Jenner informs them that the building's energy has run out and that the building will explode. Carl is seen crying, as he does not want to die. When Dr. Jenner lets the group free, Carl flees with the others to Dale's RV and watches as the CDC burns in flames. They then head toward 
Fort Benning
.

"
What Lies Ahead
"


Carl is first seen in the car with Lori, Rick, Sophia, and Carol. Lori touches on some of their past and explains to Carl that when he was a baby, he and his parents took a trip to the Grand Canyon. They playfully joke and laugh when they tell him that he threw up a lot. Carl expresses how he would like to go see the Grand Canyon one day. Carl is later seen gathering supplies with his fellow survivors. When a 
herd
 of walkers approach, they hide underneath the cars. Carl appears very frightened, but Rick, who is just a few feet away, attempts to calm him down. Sophia is then chased by a duo of walkers and gets lost.

Later, after the herd passes by, Carl finds a 
Gerber bag of tools
, which he is ordered by Shane to give to Dale. Carl and the others then go out to look for Sophia. When they reach a church, they decide to split. 
Daryl Dixon
 leads the group back to 
the interstate
, and Rick and Shane continue to look for Sophia. Carl asks his father to let him help with the search, and Rick complies. Later, Carl, Shane, and Rick see a buck in the woods. Shane is about to shoot it, but Rick stops him and the two watch Carl approach it slowly. However, the peace is abruptly interrupted by a loud gunshot. Both Carl and the buck fall to the ground as the bullet passes through the buck, hitting Carl in the stomach. He is then seen lying on the ground unconscious. Rick rushes to his son.



"
Bloodletting
"


During a flashback, Carl is seen leaving his school. As he approaches his mother, he is told that his father has been shot and is in critical condition at the hospital. He begins to cry and hugs his mother as Shane looks on. Back in the present, Otis, the man who accidentally shoots Carl, tells Rick that the farmhouse in which he has been staying is nearby and that the owner, Hershel, is able to help Carl. Rick then hurries Carl toward 
Hershel Greene
's farm. After a lengthy run, Rick arrives at the farm with Carl in his arms and hurries inside the house. Rick places Carl on the bed, and Hershel checks his pulse, telling Rick that he is alive. Carl is unconscious due to trauma and blood loss. Unfortunately, Carl awakens while Hershel is performing surgery because of the pain. He screams in agony and Rick tells Hershel to stop since he's killing him, but eventually Carl passes out from the pain.

Rick then gives blood to Carl as they are of the same blood type. Hershel confronts Rick about Carl's condition: "
He's out of danger for the moment, but I need to remove the remaining fragments. I need to go deeper to get the others. There's more. His belly's distended, his pressure's dropping, which means there's internal bleeding. A fragment must have nicked one of the blood vessels. I have to open him up, find the bleeder and stitch it. And he can't move while I'm in there. I mean, at all. If he reacts the same as before, I'll sever an artery and he'll be dead in minutes. To even try this, I have to put him under. But if I do, he won't be able to breath on his own. Same bad results.
" Later, Shane and Otis head towards a former 
FEMA
 evacuation center which used to be a high school for medical supplies to operate on Carl.



"
Save the Last One
"


Carl is still unconscious and is losing too much blood due to internal bleeding. Rick is unable to donate anymore blood to him since his blood levels are critically low as well. Later Rick is talking to Lori, telling her Carl is going to be okay and that he's in this world now, to which Lori responds: "
Maybe he shouldn't be. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be. Why do we want Carl to live in this world? To have this life? So he can see more people torn apart in front of him? So that he can be hungry and scared for however long he has before he... - so he can run and run and run and run and then even if he survives, he ends up... he ends up just another animal who doesn't know anything except survival? If he... if he dies tonight, it ends for him. Tell me why it would be better another way.
" Carl does wake up briefly in pain, to which his parents quickly rush to his side. Carl tells Lori, "
You should have seen it. The deer. It was so pretty, Mom. It was so close. I... I've never been...
" shortly before his eyes glaze over and goes limp. He has a horrifying seizure and his parents are forced to watch him convulse on the bed.

Hershel informs Rick and Lori that if Shane and Otis do not arrive in time with the needed medical supplies, they have to make a choice on whether to allow Hershel to perform the surgery knowing the risks of what could happen to Carl. Rick and Lori tell him to go ahead with the surgery. Before Hershel makes an incision, however, Shane makes it back to the farm with the supplies, but sadly without Otis. Later that night, Rick and Lori are waiting outside for the news whether Carl has survived or not, and it turns out that he has indeed survived. Rick thanks Hershel, as Lori goes to Carl relieved and crying.



"
Cherokee Rose
"


The rest of the group finds out that the surgery was successful and they sigh in relief. Carl wakes up for the first time and his parents are instantly at his side calming him down from everything he's processing. He asks Rick if they found Sophia yet. Rick lies and tells Carl that she's fine. Carl is told the truth later by Lori since at the time, they didn't want Carl to worry and wanted him to recover. Later, he and Rick talk for a bit and Rick takes his badge off his hat, and gives Carl the hat to wear.



"
Chupacabra
"


In a flashback, Carl is seen on the highway with Lori, Shane, Carol, her husband 
Ed

Carl asks Sophia and her mother for food, but Ed shuns his wife for wanting to give out food to strangers. Carol consents but still sneaks food for Carl. Lori and Shane, meanwhile, are off watching the military bomb Atlanta. Sophia tells Carl that she likes his dad (as she thinks that Shane is his father), but Carl responds with "
Shane's not my dad.... My dad is dead.
" Carl is seen later in the present day still lying in bed sleeping and recovering from being shot by Otis.

Everything's food for something else.
" Carl is seen in the back when the group are talking about gun training. Shane approaches him and Carl wants to learn too. He asks if Shane can teach him how to shoot a gun and Shane tells him that that's up to his parents. Before Carl leaves, however, he is caught with a gun on him and Shane informs Carl's parents about it immediately. His mother is furious, but his father says that he does need to know how to handle a gun, for his own protection.

"
Pretty Much Dead Already
"


Carl tells Shane that he doesn't want to give up on the search despite Shane's arguments and wanting to move on: 
"I know you think Sophia's dead and that we should stop looking for her. But that's... that's bullshit. We're going to stay here until we find her."
 Shane decides to support Carl until the end of the episode, where the group of survivors shoots all of the walkers that were in the barn. Carl is saddened to see that Sophia was in fact a walker and clutches to Lori for comfort, weeping uncontrollably, as Rick shoots Sophia.



"
Nebraska
"


Carl talks to Lori, his mother, about Sophia, stating that he wanted to be the one to find her alive, but thinks that Rick did the right thing in shooting Sophia. He states that he would have done the same thing had he been in his father's place. Lori appears shocked that he would say such a thing, and is worried that he's getting too cold. Carl attends Sophia, 
Annette Greene
, and 
Shawn
's funeral with Lori and Rick.



"
Triggerfinger

After Lori is brought back to Hershel's farm by Shane, Shane reveals to everyone, including Carl, that Lori is pregnant. Carl is furious that his mother didn't tell him she was pregnant.

Judge, Jury, Executioner

Carl speaks with Shane about 
Randall
, who had been brought back to the farm after his former group members abandoned him, but Shane tells him that Randall's fate is the adult's business. He later sneaks into the barn where Randall is being held prisoner, but Shane discovers him and tells him to stay away from Randall. They bicker back and forth until eventually Carl backs down and nods in understanding. Carl is seen at Sophia's grave, mourning, shortly before insulting Carol for believing that Sophia is in a better place, stating that Heaven does not exist and that she is an idiot for believing in it.

Rick later tells him that he must keep his act together and to consider the fact that Carol has just lost her daughter. He states that if she wants to believe that she's in a better place for comfort, he should not insult her for thinking that. Rick goes on his lecture, saying 
"Don't talk. Think."
 Carl later steals a gun from Daryl's motorcycle and goes to the woods. He finds a walker trapped in the mud and decides to taunt it. He stares at it for a while and then begins to throw rocks at the walker, intimidating it. Carl then steps onto the mud and holds up the gun, ready to shoot it. He takes too long, however, and one of the walker's legs breaks free. Carl falls back, terrified, and loses the gun in the mud. The walker manages to grabs onto Carl's feet, trying to pull him closer so he can eat him. After a struggle, Carl manages to get loose and he runs back to the house, where he is forbidden to speak of Randall's fate.

Later, he sneaks to Randall's execution and tells his father to kill him while he is watching. Shane takes him away and Rick spares Randall. Later, Dale is attacked by a walker that mortally wounds him. Carl arrives to the scene and sees that the walker that attacked Dale is the same one that he taunted in the swamp.

"
Better Angels
"


At the beginning of the episode, Carl is seen crying at Dale's funeral. He then goes to Shane, telling him that he stole Daryl's gun, and the walker that killed Dale was the same one he found in the swamp stuck in the mud that got one foot lose and lunged at Carl he got scared and did not shoot the walker and that Dale's death was his fault. He asks Shane not to say anything to his parents. Shane, however, tells Rick what happened to Carl. Rick finds Carl in the barn. They have a father and son talk, as Rick tells him: 
"No more kid stuff. I wish you could have the childhood I had, but that's not going to happen. People are gonna die. I'm gonna die. Mom. There's no way you can ever be ready for it. I try to be, but I can't. The best we can do now is avoid it as long we can. Keep one step ahead. I wish I had something better to say, something more profound. My father was good like that. But I'm tired, son. Please, take it."
 Rick then hands the gun back to Carl and he accepts it.

When Shane informs everyone that Randall has escaped, Carl is instructed by his mother to stay in the house while Rick, Shane, Glenn, and Daryl go looking for him. Eventually, Carl sneaks out of the house and walks onto the field where Rick is standing over Shane's dead body. Carl is frightened and points his gun in the direction of Rick as an undead Shane rises, unbeknownst to Rick. Rick asks Carl to calm down, thinking he's going to shoot him.

"
Beside the Dying Fire
"


After shooting a reanimated Shane, the gunshot rings through the woods, and a herd of walkers is seen advancing towards the farm.

As Carl and Rick walk back to the farm, they see the herd of walkers. Rick ushers Carl ahead and they start running towards the farm but get cut of from walkers so run to the barn instead. Back at the farm, Lori realizes that Carl is missing. As chaos ensues, Carl goes into the barn with Rick. They both start spreading gas onto the hay, and then Rick gives Carl a lighter and tells him to drop it when he says.

Just then, cars arrive with the rest of the surviving group members, including Lori. Rick's car runs out of gas and he later confesses to the group that every one turns. Later that night, he is seen crying into Lori's shoulder as Rick talks to the group, revealing how Shane was killed.

"
Seed
"


Carl is seen to have a lot more responsibility and an overall more vital role within the group by this time. His parents are no longer overly protective of him, as he is part of the first team of the group (along with Rick, Daryl, and T-Dog) to clear any walkers out of an abandoned house. Rick entrusts Carl to check over the kitchen and other parts of the house on his own, and gives him other important jobs such as guarding the vehicles, killing walkers from a watch tower in the prison, and leaving him to protect the women while he and the others inspect the rest of the prison. He also no longer has any problems with shooting walkers, as he's seen shooting one in the house and shooting others in the prison. Throughout the episode, it appears he has also developed a crush on Hershel's 17-year-old daughter 
Beth
, but has not told her because of his apparent shyness.

Sick

Carl is mostly seen by Hershel's side during this episode. When Rick and the others come back from the search, Rick calls to his son to open the door quickly because Hershel is bitten and bleeding out because Rick chopped off his leg.

After T-Dog and Rick get provisions from the prisoners, Carl is assigned to organize the food, but also locates the prison's infirmary on his own and says to have cleared out the infirmary's medical supplies, and killing two walkers in the process. Lori chastises him for going out by himself, although she appreciates Carl helping out Hershel. Carl gets angry and told his mother to "Get off his back". Beth scolds him for talking to his mother with disrespect, and Carl runs off in embarrassment. When Hershel stops breathing, Beth calls for help and Lori gives Hershel CPR, bringing him back to life. Carl is waiting outside Hershel's cell with Beth. He points his gun at Hershel after he is mistakenly thought to have become a walker. Near the end of the episode, Hershel wakes up again, and Carl smiles at him.

He and Maggie protect Lori along their way until she suddenly goes into labor. They escort Lori into an empty room and Carl watches as Maggie gives Lori a spontaneous Caesarian section for the baby, killing her. Before she dies, she says to Carl; "
You are going to beat this world, I know you will. You are smart, and you are strong, and you are so brave, and I love you. You gotta do what's right. It's so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So, so, if it feels wrong don't do it, alright? If it feels easy don't do it, don't let this world spoil you. You're so good, my sweet boy. Best thing I ever did, and I love you, I love you. My sweet, sweet, boy. I love you.
" Just as Maggie and Carl are leaving, Carl thinks about his mother reanimating and can't bear it, so he hugs her dead body and shoots her in the head, killing her once and for all. After Carl and Maggie walk outside the prison yard with the baby, the group automatically guesses that Lori is dead. Carl just stands there, holding back tears, as Rick sobs with grief.

Say the Word
"


Carl is first seen holding his baby sister with the others just moments after his mother dies. He walks over to Hershel and they discuss what they will do for formula. Carl then watches sadly as his father storms off into the prison to reach his wife's dead body. He is later comforted by Beth at Daryl's request. Towards the end of the episode, Daryl feeds Carl's sister and he asks him if he's thought of a name yet. Carl says: "
Not yet. But I was thinking maybe Sophia? Then there's, Carol too. And... Andrea, Amy, Jacqui, Patricia. Or... Lori. I don't know.
" His voice begins to crack and he walks off, his mother's death still too raw in his mind.

Oscar
 go out to clear the remaining walkers from the cell block. Daryl, in an attempt to comfort Carl and get him to open up, reveals to him that he also lost his mother at a young age: "
Come on. You know, my mom, she liked her wine. She liked to smoke in bed. Virginia slims. I was playing out with the other kids in the neighborhood. I could do that with Merle gone. They had bikes, I didn't. We heard sirens getting louder. They jumped on their bikes, ran after it, you know, hoping to see something worth seeing. I ran after them, but I couldn't keep up. I ran around a corner and saw my friends looking at me. Hell, I saw everybody looking at me. Fire trucks everywhere. People from the neighborhood. It was my house they were there for. It was my mom in bed, burnt down to nothing. That was the hard part. You know, she was just gone. Erased. Nothing left of her. People said it was better that way. I don't know. Just made it seem like it wasn't real, you know?
" Carl then says to Daryl: "
I shot my mom. She was out, hadn't turned yet. I ended it. It was real.
" They exchange sorrows and move on.

Later, a walker sneaks up on them and they kill it shortly before Daryl discovers Carol's knife in the dead walker's neck. Carl and Oscar return to the group. Later, Rick returns and holds

They both joke about being on a jumbo jet. Carol tells Carl how proud his mother was of him. Carl denies that and starts to cry and he feels tremendous guilt from being so mean to Lori; it's all he thinks about. When Rick arrives back at the prison, he hugs Carl in relief. Carl asks about Oscar, shortly before finding out he didn't make it. Carl is later seen watching Tyreese's group again shortly before being scared by Rick during his breakdown.

"
Clear
"


Carl, along with Rick and Michonne, are traveling to King County in the hopes of finding more weapons. He stares at a survivor in the road while the car passes by, while Rick and Michonne don't bat an eyelid. Later, Michonne who is driving gets the car stuck in mud and thus Carl appears annoyed. Walkers start banging on their car, Rick rolls down the window aims his python and tells Carl to cover his ears. Rick takes opportunity to bond with Carl and teaches him how to free the car by using traction. Carl doesn't seem to like Michonne and asks "
Why'd you let her come? She took you to 
Woodbury
 and you said she just split on you. - And Oscar died and you guys--
" Before he can continue Rick cuts him off explaining it wasn't that simple and that explains the situation to him. They hear and see the road survivor again shouting for them to stop, only for them to drive off. Arriving in King County Carl and the others walk into Rick's old police weapon locker room to find that it is empty. Carl looks on as Michonne and Rick bicker back on forth discussing where to get more weapons.

After walking around a corner to get to the main street which is filled with walkers and booby traps, a walker walks into a wire and is shot in the head. Carl along with the others are taken by surprise by a man on a roof, telling them to drop their weapons, Rick orders Carl to go back to the car as a shootout begins. The attacker disappears from the roof and tries to shoot Rick, but before he can do something, Carl shoots him in his chest, causing him to fall unconscious. Rick looks at his son with a concerning look, having not wanted him to do something like that, but Carl says he had to. It is revealed that the attacker is wearing an armor, and that he is actually 
Morgan Jones
, whom Rick had first met after awaking from his coma. They drag him back to his building, while avoiding a few close calls with the traps and eventually stumble upon the arsenal Morgan has acquired through the months. While searching the apartment, Carl finds a painted map of King County on a wall, and learns that their old house was burnt down. He is then questioned by Rick if that was the reason he came with them, which he denies.

Carl says he's going on a run. He wants to get a baby crib for Judith. Rick doesn't allow his son to go at first, but Michonne offers to go with him, which Rick allows. Carl tells Michonne that she didn't need to come and tells her to dispatch a lone walker, which gives him enough time to make a run for it. Michonne catches up to him, and he explains that he wants to do this by himself. Michonne notices Carl has passed the baby place, to which he replies that he's getting something else for Judith first. Carl and Michonne arrive at the door to the King County Cafe. Carl wipes away at the window to get a better look inside and grabs the doorknob but before he can open the door Michonne pulls him away. Michonne explains how she wasn't going to let him go in there, to which Carl snaps back, saying: "
I just think it's none of your business. You don't know me. You don't know my dad. You came out here for common interests. We have the same enemy and the same problem. And that's why you're here. That's it. This is important. I'm going to do this."
 Michonne replies saying she can't stop him but he can't stop her from helping him.

Carl rolls the skateboard-traps to get the walkers' attention and the duo sneak in the cafe without alerting the walkers. Carl spots what he wants and stands on a chair to be able to grab it while Michonne stands watch. A walker that was hiding grabs onto Carl's foot but Michonne quickly dispatches it silently before the walker can kill Carl. The duo make their way back, but a mouse manages to escape one of the traps and runs past them, alerting the walkers of their presence .The duo dispatch multiple walkers, but before they get out, Carl drops his prize. Carl is seen getting furious saying how they need to go back, and that it's the only one left. After some arguing, Carl backs down and follows Michonne's order to stay put while she gets his prize for him. It turns out to be an old picture of him, Lori, and his father. He has hopes that Judith could at least know how her mother looked like, and he thanks Michonne.

Later, Carl and Michonne are seen carrying the crib back to the car and Rick asks him if everything went all right, to which Carl smiles and replies "
I think she may be one of us.
" Rick, surprised at this answer, takes his son's input. Shortly after Carl apologies to Morgan for shooting him, saying it was something that had to be done. Morgan tells Carl never to be sorry. On the way back, the road survivor's remains are all over the road and Carl gets out the back and grabs the backpack he was carrying.



"
Arrow on the Doorpost
"


Carl is seen helping Glenn, along with the rest of the group, who organizing their new arsenal, while Rick, Hershel, and Daryl are off to the meeting with the Governor. Merle tells him that his father could very much be dead and that his head is on a pike, to which Carl snaps back: "
My father can handle himself!
" Later he is briefly seen when Rick tells them they are going to war.



"
This Sorrowful Life
"


Carl is seen first with Maggie on the other side of fence, screaming and shouting while banging on the plates to get the walker's attention to create a diversion. Carl is seen hearing his father's speech regarding decisions that affect the whole group.



"
Welcome to the Tombs
"


Carl is first seen depressingly packing his and Judith's bags as they prepare to leave the prison. As Carl is packing his stuff, he pulls out the old picture of him, Rick, and Lori that he and Michonne recovered previously. He stares sadly at the picture, reflecting on what has happened to him thus far and what could happen to the rest of his family. Before Carl leaves his room, he takes and stares at Rick's old badge before putting it in his pocket so he has something else by which to remember the old world and his father. When Rick tries talking to him, he pushes his dad away and throws his stuff in the car. Everybody notices how angry Carl is, including Glenn, who tells Rick, "
I've never seen him this mad. Even with Lori. He just shutdown.
" Rick says how he's still a kid and it's easy to forget. Rick and the others decide to stay at the prison and defend it. Carl is sent with Hershel, Beth, and Judith to a safe location in the woods. As the firefight ensues, Carl is getting annoyed because he feels that he should be there, fighting alongside the rest and that they shouldn't be risking their lives for him.

When Rick and the others gain the upper hand, the Governor and his army retreat. A fleeing Woodbury soldier named 
Jody
 stumbles upon Carl and the others in the woods. Jody is told to drop his gun. Instead, Jody holds the gun in his hands and slowly walks towards Carl, saying to "take it." Before Jody gets too close, Carl shoots him in the head, killing him, leaving Hershel and Beth shocked. They all meet up, and Rick hugs Carl in relief that he's alive. Carl tells Rick how he did his job out there just like everyone else and that he took out one of the Governor's soldiers, and that he's going with them, not wanting to be left out. Hershel tells Rick that Carl murdered Jody in cold blood, which leaves Rick very concerned for Carl.

Later, Rick approaches Carl and tries to talk to him about the boy he shot. Carl dodges his father's questions stating how Jody had a gun and how he had just attacked us. Rick asks if he was handing the gun over and Carl says that he couldn't take the risk of letting him live, reliving how he had the chance to kill the walker that eventually disemboweled Dale, but didn't. When Rick tries to argue, Carl brings up how he let 
Andrew
 and the Governor live, which resulted in the deaths of Lori, T-Dog, and Merle, respectively. Carl tells Rick to go before the Governor kills any more of them, leaving Rick shocked at his son's understandable logic. Rick has nothing to say and before Carl leaves, he drops the badge from Rick's hat on the ground. However, he ends up staying behind and only Rick, Daryl, and Michonne go.

When they come back with all the Woodbury citizens, Carl angrily asks his dad what's going on. When Rick explains that the survivors left Woodbury and will be staying here, Carl angrily walks away, concerned that Rick is letting residents of the town that just attacked them in without caution.

"
30 Days Without An Accident
"


In the six/seven months period between the skirmish with Woodbury, the prison underwent many improvements. Now with kids of his own age, Carl starts to slowly go back to his old self, enjoying his "childhood" and doing things any other boy would do, like collecting comic books and playing soccer. He still retains some hardness from living in a post-apocalypse world, scolding a group of kids for naming walkers.



"
Infected
"


Rick wakes up Carl early in the morning for the farming chores. He brings up that the fence cleaners will need help,  and ask if they can join them. Rick responds, saying that he has other plans, and Carl then asks if he can help them. Rick finishes off saying "
We
 [they] have other plans". Carl then proceeds to say he's sorry, and that he's been trying to live a normal life, to which Rick points out how proud he is. Before they can continue, gunshots, coming from D Block, take their attention. Rick orders Carl to join Maggie in the guard tower. Michonne, who was riding away, returns to help, but walkers enter the open gate and nearly kill her. Carl instinctively grabs a rifle and shoots one of them.

Carl helping Michonne, who injured her leg, they walk back to the cell block and come across Rick returning from the skirmish in D Block. Carl hugs his dad, saying he's sorry but he had to grab the rifle to kill a walker. He is visibly shaken to hear that his friend 
Patrick
 has died. Later he's seen crafting a cross for his burial, asking Carol if Patrick was Catholic. She replies, saying that he was atheist. She asks if he told his father about the knife lessons. Carl says that he won't lie to his dad and that he will tell him. And so he does, and Rick, realizing that they're never going back to their pre-apocalyptic lives, hands Carl back his gun.



"
Isolation
"


Carl is first seen packing his things to move to the office blocks, where the healthy but vulnerable people are being isolated. He appears to dislike this as he'd be locked away with the other kids, but in the end he does honor his father's wishes. Rick trusts Carl to patrol the corridor and keep people safe. 

Sometime in the day when Carl is patrolling the corridor, he spots Hershel walking off. Curiously, he asks where he's going and quickly gathers that Hershel is sneaking out of the prison to gather supplies, alone. Carl says that he can't let Hershel go there alone, which Hershel ignores, not wanting to be told what to do by a younger person. Carl presses on but, realizing he can't stop Hershel, offers to go with him to help. They both leave to acquire herbs to tend the sick survivors.

Later in the episode Carl is seen guarding Hershel while he examines and picks the medical herbs required. Hershel talks to Carl, acknowledging his maturity and growth. Because of the recent events going on at the prison, Hershel reckons it's safer outside the prison, to which Carl disagrees after seeing a rotting, tree walker. They examine it only for a second walker to spot them. Carl raises his gun towards the walker but Hershel tells him that he doesn't have to, thus recalling his father's same "Don't fire unless you absolutely have to" motto and lowering his gun. They walk back to the prison with the medical supplies.



"
Internment
"


Carl is first seen in A-Block when Rick comes back from the medical supply run. Three calls of Carl's name it takes but he comes running around the corner, greeting his father. Rick chucks a few bags of food Carl's way, and tells him to tell the others to brush their teeth. Carl asks if he and the others can come out of the quarantine zone, to which Rick soundly gives a no, fixed on keeping his son safe and away from the violence. Shortly after Carl says "Dad, you can't keep me from it, from what always happens", Rick replies with "Yeah... maybe... but I think it's my job to try."

Later in the episode the fences seem to be in a crucial state to the point of breaking. A gunshot goes off, and Rick tells Maggie to go back inside. Rick realizing that he can't secure the fences alone goes to find Carl. Another three calls of Carl's name it takes but he comes running around the corner. Rick asks for Carl's help and Carl gladly accepts.

Rick and Carl are later seen working on securing the fences. They're using thick logs to try and add support to the fence, to prevent a collapse. The father and son share a touching moment as Carl helps Rick with the final log but the logs begin to break from the sheer pressure of the increasing number of walkers pressing on the fence. The fence collapses and the duo run for their lives, into the tower and into the inner fences. Rick, knowing that the second layer of defense won't hold for long, brings Carl over to the guns as they prep to unload on the undead. Rick gives Carl a crash-course on the mechanics of the M4A1 assault rifle that he's given and they fire, gunning down any walker in sight.

It's at this point that Rick accepts Carl for who he is: a man. Carl at one point even aids the ammo-less Rick by killing the nearing walker and tossing him an extra mag. Rick watches Carl as he advances on the walkers, clearly in control. All the walkers are defeated and Rick and Carl do a clean up, looking for any surviving walkers and stabbing their heads with sharp metal poles. Carl notices Daryl and the others returning and tells Rick that everything will be okay.

Finally, Carl is seen the following morning, running to Rick, wanting to be with him. He and Rick begin farming and share a pea-pod, two peas in a pod.



"

Carl briefly appears in this episode, being watched from a distance by the Governor.



"
Too Far Gone
"


As the Governor tells Rick he and the others must leave the prison by sundown, Carl is seen with the others arming up for the potential shootout between the two groups. When the Governor brings out his hostages, Carl states that he could "end this right now," but Daryl tells him no, as it could lead to even worse results. After the Governor slashes Hershel's neck with Michonne's sword, Carl, along with Daryl and Rick, open fire on the Governor and his men, Carl hits the governor in the arm and another man in the shoulder. Carl continues to fire at the Governor and his men until they break through the fence. After Michonne saves Rick, he asks her, "Where's Carl?" Stumbling up to the main gate, he sees Carl kill two walkers before they reunite. He asks him, "Where's Judith?" to which Carl replies, "I don't know." As they locate Judith's bloody car seat, Carl, becoming enraged and believing his sister to be dead, unloads his remaining ammo into one of the walker's heads before collapsing in Rick's arms in tears. Rick tells him, "We have to go" and the two leave the prison. The two are last seen limping through the woods surrounding the prison with Rick telling Carl, "Don't look back." 



"
After
"


Rick and Carl come across a bar while walking from the prison, finding a few supplies before coming across a house in a neighborhood, where they reside. Rick takes notice of his son's hostility towards him while pushing a sofa up against the door. While sleeping on the couch, Rick falls into unconsciousness and Carl tries unsuccessfully to wake Rick up the next day. Carl leads two walkers away from the house when they try to get in the door, and is almost attacked by a third, but he manages to kill all three. Carl also begins to rant while Rick is still unconscious, scolding him for underestimating Carl's survival skills, as well as failing to protect Judith, Hershel, Glenn, Daryl, and rudely says that he would be fine if Rick died. Carl leaves and goes into another house where he finds food, including a large can of chocolate pudding. Carl is then attacked by two walkers, but kills one of them, but then finds that his gun is empty and barely manages to escape into a nearby room. Rick wakes up and Carl, having returned to the house for the night and thinking his father has turned, cannot go through with killing him and tries to commit suicide by allowing Rick to kill him for being wrong about thinking he would be better off on his own. However, Rick did not reanimate and tells his son after crawling towards him, "Don't go outside. Stay safe." Carl cradles his father's head in his lap and whispers repeatedly, "I'm scared." The two hear a knock on the door the next day, and Rick gets up and looks through the peephole, only to see Michonne standing there. Rick keels over with laughter, telling Carl that it is for him. 



"
Claimed
"


Carl is first seen having cereal in the house with Michonne. They joke about soy milk and how he almost threw up once after drinking it in third grade. He accidentally brings up Judith in the conversation, reminding him of the fact that she, as far as he is aware, is dead, which shatters the brief moment of relief and laughter they were having just moments before.

He later goes on a run with Michonne, where she reveals a bit more about her past life, including her deceased son. It is clear through the episode they've built a friendship together, acknowledged by Rick, who said to her earlier that he can't be everything to him, proving they do have a strong bond. He arrives with Michonne back at the house just as Rick flees from the hostile group who occupied it. At the end of the day they stop by a abandoned train freight, seeing a sign reading sanctuary, up in the track. They then start to walk on the tracks.



"
Us
"


Carl is seen with Rick and Michonne on the railroad track, competing in a bet with Michonne to see who can walk on the rails the longest without falling off. Carl wins the bet and gets to choose one of the last two candy bars in their supply, in which he chooses the Big Cat bar. At the end of the episode, 
Joe
's group, who took up occupation of the house that they were staying in in "Claimed", is seen walking past the Big Cat wrapper, lying between the ties on the same railroad track Rick, Carl and Michonne were seen on.



"
A
"


Rick, Michonne, and Carl complain about how hungry they are. In an attempt to stave this off, Rick shows Carl and Michonne how to set up a trap to catch a wild animal, such as a rabbit. Upon hearing a scream, Carl runs into the woods to see a man surrounded by walkers. He lifts his gun to shoot the walkers but is stopped by Rick, who tells him the man can't be saved. The trio then return to the woods. They find an abandoned car and decide to spend the night there.

As Rick and Michonne talk by the fire, and Carl sleeps in the car, Joe's group surprises them, holding Rick and Michonne at gunpoint. Daryl, who had recently joined the group but had no idea they were hunting Rick, asks Joe to spare them. Joe orders his men to rape and beat Daryl to death. A terrified Carl is taken from the car by 
Dan
, who shoves him to the ground. Screaming and crying, Carl tries to get away, before Dan grabs him, pins him down and begins to unbuckle his pants and push them down, clearly planning to rape Carl.

The sight of his son helpless, about to be raped, and the knowledge that everyone with him will suffer and die, causes Rick to launch a feral attack, tearing out Joe's jugular vein with his teeth. In the shock that follows, Michonne and Daryl manage to kill everyone but Dan. Dan holds Carl at knife-point, begging for his life. An enraged Rick disembowels Dan, as Carl looks on, traumatized, clinging to Michonne.

The next day, Carl is seen sleeping on Michonne's lap. e has a nightmare, presumably about the previous events, and wakes up in fear. He overhears his father talking to Daryl about leaving behind the humanity he'd tried to find at the prison, how he now knows what he has to do to survive, and for Carl to survive.

When they get near 
Terminus
, Rick asks the group to split up and stake out various parts of the gates, to get a feel for the place. Scared of his father, Carl declines Rick's offer to watch with him, going to Michonne instead. When Michonne encourages him to not shut his father out, he tells her about the darkness he feels and that he hasn't been able to keep a hold on; that he's a monster. Michonne does her best to convince him things will change, revealing her own breakdown following her son's death. She tells him that he, Andrea, and Rick were the ones who pulled her back.

Carl and the others arrive in Terminus, and meet the group, led by 
Gareth
. They briefly forfeit their weapons and agree to be searched for more. When the man frisking them sees how bruised they are, he says he hoped whoever caused that got what they deserved. Carl coldly says that they did.

Rick soon senses danger when he sees various people with items that belonged to other members of the group, like Glenn. He takes a 
Terminus resident
 hostage, demanding answers. Ultimately he and the others run for it, but are herded toward a boxcar. At threat of Carl's life, the adults agree to surrender. Carl then slowly makes his way into the boxcar with them, shaking with terror. Carl reunites with most of the rest of the larger group who were already in the boxcar (everyone but Beth, Carol, Tyreese, and Judith), along with some new faces. He watches as Rick boasts that Terminus has "screwed with the wrong people".

Carl is later seen in the church looking after Judith by feeding her with a bottle.

When Rick decides to leave on a supply run with Gabriel, Michonne, Bob and Sasha, he talks to Carl first. Rick confesses to not trusting Gabriel, to which Carl states that, 'everyone can't be bad.' Rick warns Carl to not be fooled into a false sense of security and that he is not safe. Anyone could try to rape and possibly kill him at any time. Although he is clearly shaken, Carl promises to be careful, and Rick departs.

When Rick later returns, he is directed to the back of the church where he is told Carl is. Carl reveals he has been trying to figure out what Gabriel is hiding and has found scratch marks on the windows.

Carl expresses surprise at being caught, and continues trying to find her. She tells him that he scares her somewhat. She reveals herself after she grows bored of hiding, asking why he followed her outside of the walls in the first place. 

Carl explains that he didn't know why she was leaving if they were safe inside the walls, to which she replies that she was not meant to hide behind walls.

Eventually, the two run out of breath and set themselves down upon a fallen tree. Carl compliments her skills and praises her knife. He and Enid discuss that it is important what their past is after she says that it didn't matter what happened to her mom. While chatting on the matter of their parents, a score of walkers enter their area, prompting the two of them to hide inside of a hollow tree. 

The two barely have enough room as it is inside the tree as the walkers pass by them. Enid explains to him how their lives should always be the way it was when they were running. Carl rubs her hand affectionately and she leans in to kiss him, but when he shows a somewhat awkward reaction, she pauses, making him blush.

"
Start to Finish
"


Carl first appears when he, Ron, Michonne and Gabriel come across Rick and Deanna as they all flee from the massive herd that have entered Alexandria through the destroyed part of the community's wall. They are then cornered by another group of walkers from the herd ahead of the road they are running on. Jessie then appears, shoots at the walkers and lets them in at her house.

Carl later sees Ron enter the garage and decides to check up on him. He then talks to him about what they are currently in and when Ron says that they will all be dead, Carl tries to assure him that they'll make it, however, Ron locks the door behind him and draws his gun, holding him at gunpoint. Carl is able to knock the gun out of Ron's hand and the two engage in a short fight. Ron grabs a shovel and almost hits Carl with it, but instead hits one of the windows, attracting the walkers outside towards it. Ron begins strangling Carl with it, as Carl cries out, ,struggling to breathe. He is able to push Ron off of him, just in time, as the walkers reach outside the window he was pinned on.

Eventually, Rick and Jessie are able to open the garage's door just as the walkers come in. When Rick asks him what happened, he covers Ron by saying that they hit one of the shelves by accident and hit the window. He then follows Ron and holds him at gunpoint and tells him to give him his gun before telling him that his dad, referring to Pete, was an asshole.

He is later seen trying to hold the makeshift defenses they made around the house, just as the herd begins to break in through the front door and windows. He and the others retreat upstairs where Rick and Michonne kill and carry two walkers and decide to use their blood and organs to mask their scent to blend in with the herd below to escape.

Afterward, when he and everyone, except for Deanna, are prepared to leave, Rick hands him Judith and covers her with another bedsheet filled with walker blood and guts and covers her below his own bedsheet. They all then leave and stand at the front of Jessie's front porch, where he, Rick, Michonne, Jessie, Gabriel, Ron and Sam look on as the streets of Alexandria are now overrun by the herd. They all hold hands together and make their way through the herd undetected.



"
No Way Out

Carl is seen with the rest of the group sneaking through the herd of walkers. The group soon comes to a stop on the side of the road in order to discuss an alternate plan. After Gabriel leaves for the church with Judith, Carl and the remaining group members trek towards the community gate in order to escape and recover the vehicles from the quarry; the trek lasts for several hours into nightfall.

As the group presses onward, Sam freezes in fear after witnessing a boy walker in the herd. Despite Rick's, Jessie's and Ron's attempts to calm him down, Sam starts to complain, drawing the attention of several walkers who proceed to grab and devour him. Jessie, in her state of severe emotional distress, is unable to let go of neither Carl nor Sam, causing her to fall into the feast after Sam.

Carl calls out to Rick, scared, bringing to attention his inescapable predicament. With remorse, Rick unsheathes his hatchet and hesitantly hacks off Jessie's hand to save Carl from suffering the same fate. Ron, witnessing his family's demise at Rick's hands, recovers Carl's dropped gun and takes aim at Rick. Michonne intervenes, stabbing Ron through the chest; his shock from the fatal blow causes him to pull the trigger, accidentally firing a shot that passes through and destroys Carl's right eye. Carl weakly calls to his father before he collapses. Rick quickly scoops him up off the ground and makes a mad dash towards the infirmary while Michonne cuts a path.

Denise
, seeing Rick en-route to the infirmary, immediately makes preparations for Carl's recovery with the help of 
Heath
, Aaron and 
Spencer
. Carl is laid on a gurney, where Denise proceeds to tend to his grievous wounds, while Rick and, later, the other Alexandrians work together to thin out the immense herd.

The next morning, Rick visits an unconscious Carl as he is recovering in his room and laments, admitting that he underestimated the residents and that he had seen what they are really capable of, as well as revealing his plans to rebuild and extend the community the way Deanna had envisioned it. Weeping, he goes on to say that he wishes to experience this new world alongside him. Initially unresponsive, Carl then weakly tightens his grip on his father's hand.



"
The Next World
"


Two months later, Carl is called into the room by Michonne as Rick is making preparations for a supply run; he seems to have recovered from his gunshot wound by this time, as he wears a clean bandage over his eye. After discussing the shortage of toothpaste, Michonne notes that Carl's bandage needs changing.

Later during the day, he and Enid head into the woods together. As she wonders why they still go out there, Carl replies, "Because we're kids, that's what they do", to which she replies that she's not a kid. After stopping at a spot to read, they notice Michonne and Spencer also walking through the woods; Enid tells Carl she does not want to come out into the woods anymore.

As they both head back to Alexandria, Carl spots and appears to recognize a walker heading in their direction. Enid wants to kill the walker, but Carl disagrees, stopping her. Enid questions his motives, but Carl replies that she "wouldn't understand". He tells her to leave for home, as she had wanted to before.

Carl is soon spotted running in the other direction by Michonne and Spencer, as he is luring the walker, who is revealed to be a zombified Deanna, in their path; Michonne expresses confusion before catching sight of Deanna.

The same evening, Carl sits with Judith on the porch of their house as they look at the stars above, with Carl describing them to her. Michonne confronts Carl on why he left Deanna for them to dispatch, chastising him for risking his life. Carl argues, saying that the person who puts her down "should be someone who loved her," and further claims that he would do the same for Michonne. Understanding of his reasons, she hugs him.

As Rick and several others are packing the motor home for the trip to the 
Hilltop Colony
, Carl and Rick discuss Rick's newfound relationship with Michonne, with Rick attempting to explain that their hook-up "just happened". Carl lets him know that he approves of their relationship and that he even seems to like the idea, relieving Rick. When Rick tells Carl to pack his things for the drive, Carl offers to stay behind to look after the community while he's gone, insisting sadly, that "a kid with a messed-up face" would not make much of a good first impression to any intruders. Rick looks saddened by this and hugs his son before leaving.

The man reveals himself to be Negan and explains that the group now work for him, but warns that he has to "beat the holy hell" out of one of them as punishment for killing his men. He kneels down in front of Carl, telling him to at least cry a little as he menacingly stares into Negan's eyes.

After seeing Carl's scarred eye socket, Negan makes several distasteful comments on how gross it looks. Humiliated, Carl starts crying. Negan apologizes for hurting his feelings. He tells Carl that his eye is "rad as hell" and advises him to leave the bandage off so nobody will mess with him. He orders Carl to sing him a song.

Carl accompanies the group to the 
Kingdom
, where he hands his gun over to 
Richard
. They are reunited with Morgan and meet Ezekiel. They leave the next morning when Ezekiel refuses to fight. 

On their way back to Alexandria, they encounter a blockade of cars on the highway set up by the Saviors. Carl recalls the Saviors talking about a tripwire trap for a large herd of walkers. He helps to dismantle the explosives so they can take the dynamite and RPGs with them. 

Carl works with Tara and Rosita to block the on ramp and they are soon surrounded by the herd. Once they are rejoined by Rick and Michonne, they head back to Alexandria.



"
Something They Need
"


Carl is preparing to join the others on their trip to Oceanside. Enid asks if he ever thinks about the people he's killed; Carl says he does. 

Carl holds the Oceanside residents hostage as Rick explains he doesn't want to hurt anyone. Carl helps the group defeat the incoming herd of walkers.

As Carl and Enid gather the guns, he tells Enid he also thinks about the people he didn’t kill.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"


Carl is first shown when a Scavenger alerts everyone in Alexandria to the Saviors' arrival. Rick assumes his position at the front gate, with 
Jadis
 crouching by his feet, hidden from view. Negan's caravan arrives. 
Eugene
 steps out and tries to convince Rick to surrender. Rick hesitates, stricken by Eugene’s betrayal, and asks where Negan is. "I'm Negan," Eugene replies. Rick then gives Rosita the signal to detonate the explosives. Rosita pushes the detonator, but there is no explosion. Before Rick can reach for his gun, Jadis leaps up and aims her gun at Rick. Simultaneously, the Scavengers all turn their guns on the Alexandrians, including Carl. 

Negan emerges from a truck and taunts Rick as his Saviors open the truck that holds the explosives. Brion opens the gates for the Saviors. Watching the situation unfold, Michonne tries to leave her balcony post to help Rick, but Farron stops her, holding her at gunpoint. 

Negan tells him that he knew of his plan to defy and attack him, as Jadis was the "little birdle" that revealed his plans and offers to let her live if Rick turns over all their guns, and Daryl. Even then, Negan will still execute one Alexandrian of Rick’s choosing. If he refuses, Negan will kill them all. Rick insists on seeing Sasha. Negan taps Lucille against the casket, knocking. Negan opens the casket door. However, when a reanimated Sasha attacks Negan, Carl leads the attack against the 
Scavengers
 and the Saviors during the distraction. Eric and Aaron follow Carl's lead and help against the attack.

Those on the guard posts open fire on the Saviors outside. Michonne fights Farron on the balcony. In the chaos, Rosita is shot, and shortly after is escorted away by Tara. Rick tries to join the fight, but Jadis holds him at gunpoint.

In the streets below, The Saviors and Scavengers have gained control of the situation; some Alexandrians have been killed, and the rest are in custody. Carl is surrounded by over a dozen Saviors. Jadis leads Rick to Negan and orders him to kneel beside Carl. She reminds Negan of their deal – twelve people in exchange for the Scavengers' help in the attack. Negan swiftly bargains her down to 10. They look on in horror as a body plummets to the ground from Michonne's balcony post.

Negan vows to kill Carl and cut off Rick's hands as punishment for Rick's collusion. Rick swallows his fear and furiously reiterates his pledge to kill Negan, regardless of the threats he makes. As Negan prepares to strike Carl with Lucille, 
Shiva
 leaps onto and begins to maul a nearby Scavenger. Negan and the Saviors scatter as The Kingdom arrives. Rick reaches for a gun as a nearby Savior is gunned down by Maggie, who has arrived with the Hilltop fighters. Rick and Carl join the fight. Negan and his men leave under a hail of bullets and gives his attackers the middle finger before escaping. Jadis and the Scavengers retreat as well. 

After the fight is over, Rick and Carl rush to where Michonne was last seen, and find Farron's dead body on the ground. They discover Michonne inside, badly beaten and barely conscious. Rick gently embraces her.

"
Mercy
"


On the side of the road, Carl parks a van in a shot for shot recreation of Rick in the first episode. He is walking to a gas station, carrying a gas can, wearing the Sheriff's hat. He searches a gas station for fuel. 

Suddenly, he hears a voice. He comes across a nervous 
stranger
 who asks for help. He also says "May my mercy prevail over my wrath," adding that he's quoting the Koran. Carl raises his gun, but the man insists he just wants food. As Carl is considering his request, Rick appears and shoots over his head and chases him off. He was supposed to meet Carl at the intersection. Carl is frustrated by his dad's shooting but Rick insists he could be a Savior and he intentionally missed. If he's not a Savior, Rick hopes he lives, but Carl tells Rick that hope will not be enough in their struggle against the Saviors.

Carl is seen staying behind at Alexandria with Michonne while Rick leaves with a caravan of vehicles that have been retrofitted for battle. As they watch the procession of vehicles, Michonne tells Carl that this is his show; Alexandria’s safety is in his hands and says she is following him.

Later, Carl returns to the gas station and leaves two cans of food with a note, "Sorry." The mysterious man watches from the bushes.



"
The King, the Widow, and Rick
"


Carl is seen with Michonne in Alexandria reading reports about the Kingdom and Hilltop outpost battles when Tara and the Alexandria fighters return home.

Carl returns to the woods, in search of the man he met at the gas station. He finds the mysterious stranger and gives him food and water. After introducing themselves, he learns the man's name is Siddiq. Carl tells Siddiq about his community and asks him Rick's three screening questions. Siddiq explains that he's killed 237 walkers to honor his mother, because she believed killing them freed their souls. Carl then invites him to Alexandria.

On their way to Alexandria, Carl and Siddiq come across a small group of walkers feeding on a dead elk. Carl suggests they kill the walkers to honor Siddiq's mom. After a slight struggle, they kill all the walkers and continue towards Alexandria.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


In a flashback, Rick and Carl discuss Siddiq and the war with the Saviors. Carl reiterates that hope, whether for Siddiq's survival, or for the new world after the war, is not enough on its own. He implores his father to focus on what things can be after, not on killing as many of the Saviors as possible, but on working together for a better life.

In Alexandria, while the others prepare for their final assault on the Sanctuary, Carl sits alone in a room in contemplation. He writes a letter to Rick and upon sifting through a pile of papers, finds Enid's 'just survive somehow' note.

Later, Michonne finds Carl bringing supplies to a sewage entrance under cover of darkness. Carl tells her that the items are meant for Siddiq. The duo's conversation is interrupted by Negan who, having had the lookouts silently taken out, bangs Lucille against the safe haven's gates and offers them a deal over a loudspeaker: either the people of Alexandria can line up in front of their homes, decide who's going to be the offering for Lucille, have Rick killed in front of everyone and then everyone can move on with their lives, or the Saviors will bomb the safezone with grenade launchers. Negan gives the survivors three minutes for them to decide.

Carl quickly formulates an escape route from Alexandria. Michonne refuses to leave their homes to the Saviors, but Carl insists they follow his plan

As three minutes have passed, Negan and over two dozen Saviors are preparing to torch Alexandria to the ground, but Negan is interrupted by Carl who tries to defuse the situation. He says that there are children and his sister taking refuge at the town; however, Negan states that they also have young people at the Sanctuary, as well as a baby at an outpost whose fate Negan is wondering about. Carl offers his life as a punishment in the hopes that it would stop the Saviors from attacking. Negan is stunned and asks Carl if he wants to die, to which he replies he doesn't, but will, and is willing to give up his life if it means less blood will be shed.

As Negan and Carl are having their emotional conversation, Daryl leads a convoy of trucks, acting as a decoy, smashing the walls at the back of the safezone and through a roadblock of vehicles set up by Dwight, Laura, and other Saviors who subsequently chase the convoy.

Carl takes the distraction to his advantage and runs off, with Negan cursing out the boy and ordering his men to begin the bombardment. As buildings explode around him, Carl covers his escape with a trail of smoke bombs, and watches as Gabriel's church is torn apart by an explosion.

As the Saviors continue their bombardment, Carl and other Alexandrians release smoke grenades throughout the dark streets to provide cover as they flee. Shellshocked, he takes a moment to catch his breath beside one of the residences, but hears a window break, and escapes just in time as the building and others nearby explode. 

Negan's troops smash their way through Alexandria's gates. He orders the Saviors to capture Carl alive, destroy every other house, and send Rick to him when he arrives. Carl evades capture and descends into the sewers.

Carl is later seen with everyone else who have taken shelter in the sewers when Rick and Michonne join them. They find Carl, laying on the cold, hard floor, and looking sweaty and tired. Carl lifts his shirt, showing Rick an unmistakable bite on his abdomen, explaining that it happened as he helped Siddiq. Rick and Michonne reel in horror as reality sets in.



"
Honor
"


In a flashback, Carl and Siddiq fight walkers in the woods. Carl is caught off guard and gets bit in the abdomen. He shoots the one on top of him before the other which marked him for death. Siddiq asks if he is okay. Carl says "Yeah" and walks off. Carl leads Siddiq down the utility hole outside Alexandria and explains that he must talk to Rick before bringing Siddiq into their community.

In his bathroom, Carl takes his shirt and hat off, revealing his bite mark. He gets emotional looking at himself in the mirror before covering it up, putting his hat back on, and marching back outside. Atop the gate, Tobin gives Carl a note from Michonne and explains that she went to the Sanctuary. 

Later, Carl sits in the house and writes notes to Michonne, Rick, Enid and more. He explores the sewers with Siddiq. He lights candles and sets up a cot. He sits on the porch with Judith and makes handprints on the porch with paint. They take a photo together on a Polaroid camera. He hands Siddiq cans of food and candy in the sewer. Siddiq hands the candy back and Carl enjoys some bites with him. He later plants in the Alexandria farm. Michonne pulls in in her car. Carl takes his hat off and takes in some sun.

In the present, Carl shows his bite wound to Rick and gives him the stack of letters that he wrote to the group. Carl is becoming weaker. Rick sits by his side in disbelief with Michonne, when asked how he got bit, he explains that his bite was not the Saviors' fault and that it happened while he was helping Siddiq. Understandably, Rick is in denial when Carl says "I got bit". Siddiq gives Carl medicine and explains that he was a medical resident. Carl says he brought him back only because "he needed us," rather than because he was a doctor. An explosion causes dust to fall on Carl and he starts coughing. Rick shields him and gives him water. Carl talks to Michonne. He questions her leaving when she should've been resting but says she looks great now. He pleads with her to stop the war. "It's not supposed to be like this," he said. "I know it can be better." Michonne looks to Rick and nods. 

Later, Dwight tells Rick the Saviors are gone. Rick doesn't want to make the trip because Carl won't make it. He insists he has to stay with him. Michonne will stay with him, then. "Will you take Judith?" Rick asks Michonne. "She needs to be there." He breaks down. Daryl takes Judith so that Michonne can stay with Rick and Carl.

Carl wants to say goodbye to Judith. They have a emotional moment together. Carl smiles at her. "You be good, okay? For Michonne. For dad." He tells her to listen to Rick but not always. "Sometimes kids gotta show their parents the way." He hands over his hat to her. "This was dad's before it was mine," he says. "Now it's yours. Just having it, I always kept dad with me. It made me feel as strong as him. It helped me. Maybe it'll help you, too."

Carl tells Judith of what Lori's last words to him that he was gonna beat the world, and even though he didn't, he tells Judith that she will. Judith starts crying as Rick hands her to Daryl.

"These people, you saved them all," Daryl tells Carl. "It's all you, man." He walks off and Tara follows. Siddiq then kneels down and thanks Carl for helping him honor his mom and for bringing him to Alexandria. He promises to honor Carl by showing his people that what he did wasn't for nothing. Carl congratulates him on being stuck with the group before he heads out. Carl takes his last sips of water. Michonne pats him down with cloth to wipe the sweat. Carl tells Michonne to be strong for Rick, Judith and herself. "I will," Michonne says.

Rick asks for Michonne's help carrying Carl out of the sewer. Alexandria burns as Rick and Michonne carry him across a field. Carl is getting weaker. Rick insists Carl will make it to their house. Michonne suggests bringing him to another building. Rick and Michonne lay Carl down in the church. Carl expresses remorse over killing a 
boy
 when they lived in the prison. Rick tries to absolve Carl of his 
guilt
 over the boy's death. Carl points out how easy it was to kill another human being. Carl explains that Rick's decision to stop fighting and welcome Woodbury survivors into the prison was instrumental in shaping him. "It can be like that again," he tells Rick. Rick reminds Carl he can't be who he was and that the war against the Saviors is different than their situation at the prison, but Carl is resolute that he can't kill all of the Saviors and tells him that "there's gotta be something after."

Carl describes his vision for a peaceful future in which the older, white-bearded Rick resides with Judith in a flourishing Alexandria. Rick tells him that everything he did since Atlanta, was for him and nothing's gonna change that. Rick promises to make Carl's vision come true. Carl reaches for his gun and insists on shooting himself before he dies. He tells Rick and Michonne that he loves them. Rick and Michonne wait despondently outside the church, where they hear a solitary gunshot. Rick and Michonne bury Carl's body in the Alexandria graveyard.



"
Worth
"


Carl's voice is heard in Rick's head as he rereads Carl's letter to him, in which he reminisces about happier times and urges Rick to make peace with Negan and find a way to coexist. Michonne contacts Negan by walkie and reads the letter that Carl wrote him. Carl urges Negan to stop fighting and find a peaceful way forward with Rick. Negan refuses and crushes the walkie with his foot.



"
Wrath
"


Before the final battle against the Saviors, Rick has a flashback to a day before the apocalypse that Carl alluded to in his last letter to him, where he and a 3-year-old Carl hold hands walking down a country road. 

After Rick slits Negan's throat with a shard of glass, he remembers once again that day before the apocalypse with Carl. This makes Rick change his mind and to order to let Negan live at the last minute, honoring his son's last wishes.

In the present, he writes a letter to Carl, thanking him for reminding him who he is, and attributes the new world in his honor.

"
Bye
"


Carl appears in 
Rick
's flashbacks when he encounters 
Jadis
 in 
Millenium Park
.

Later, 
Benjiro
 tells 
Michonne
 that Rick had tried to have him draw a portrait of a boy on an iPhone, just like Benjiro did with Michonne and 
Judith
, but he could never get the boy quite right. Michonne tearfully tells Benjiro that the boy was Carl.



"
What We
"


Rick
 tearfully explains that the 
CRM
 took Carl and Rick lost his son again. 
"When I got taken, I fought, and I fought, and I just -- I tried to get away, by -- by -- by how I would dream. I'd meet up with Carl in my dreams. And that's how I survived in here. Kept me alive. And then one day he was just gone. He just left. But then I started dreaming of you. And there you were. You and I fell in love in different ways, and it kept me going. And then you were gone, too. And, I couldn't see your face anymore, just like I couldn't see Carl's. I can't live without you. Without you, I die."
 Rick admits that he's figured out how to do that, how to be dead and live now. Rick is terrified that if 
Michonne
 comes back into his life and he learns how to live again, Rick will lose her again and he won't figure out how to die all over again, the loss of Michonne will be something that Rick won't be able to survive this time. Rick had needed to get ahead of his fears by making her leave before Michonne could help him to live again. Sobbing, Rick explains that if he could just think that Michonne lives on longer than him without Rick knowing for sure, Rick can at least believe that she's still out there somewhere, living her life. If Michonne actually dies and Rick sees it, he won't be able to survive it. As Rick explains, Rick is shown walking with a young Carl at 
Ross' Farm
 before Carl vanishes, as well as 
his dreams of meeting Michonne in the park
.

Michonne gives Rick a newly engraved iPhone that she had 
Benjiro
 make for him, this one with a portrait of Carl, the one person who Benjiro had been unable to get right for Rick. Rick remembers Carl as a young boy and at Alexandria before his death, finally able to remember his son's face thanks to Michonne's gift. Michonne asks what Carl would say if he was here with them right now and what Carl would want his father to do with this new chance to be with the ones that he loves.

While bringing Siddiq to Alexandria, Carl and Siddiq fight a pack of walkers.

He initially conceals the bite until the Saviors' attack on Alexandria, where he reveals it to the others while hiding in the sewers.

Trivia


Carl is the second longest-running dead character in the 
series
, with the first being 
Rosita Espinosa
.


Carl held the longest lifespan of any child in the series prior to his death in the episode "
Honor
", lasting 108 episodes for seven and a half seasons.


Carl shares his name with 
Robert Kirkman
's father.

Carl is Robert Kirkman's favorite character in the show.
[6]


Rick
 and Carl share the same blood type, which is A+.
[7]


In the first three seasons, Carl usually wore a Science Dog T-shirt, a character from Robert Kirkman's other comic series, 
Invincible
.


Carl's most used weapon was a firearm called 
Beretta 92FS
, but has used other pistols throughout the series.


Like his father, Carl appears to be an atheist. He was initially shown to be somewhat of a believer as his mother tells him to say his prayers in "
TS-19
", however by "
What Lies Ahead
" he shows signs of no longer being a believer as he says nothing while in the church and by "
Judge, Jury, Executioner
" he expresses his atheism by insulting Carol for believing Sophia is in heaven and called her an idiot. By the episode "
Claimed
" however he appears to be more agnostic as seen when he expresses hope that maybe his sister Judith (whom at the time he believes dead) and Michonne's deceased son, 
Andre
 are together somewhere, presumably an afterlife.


During the 
season four premiere
, when 
Michonne
 gives Carl comics as a gift, the comic at the top is Issue #56 from 
Invincible
 - Robert Kirkman's other comic book series.


Glen Mazzara
 has stated that he considered killing Carl instead of 
Axel
 during 
the Governor
's attack in the episode "
Home
".


The first two times Carl has been shot, it has been by accident.


Everyone who has shot Carl has died due to 
walkers
. 
Otis
, 
Ron Anderson
, and himself.


Carl's first known kiss was with 
Enid
.


Both in the 
comics
 and in the TV series, Carl is the first minor to be shown driving a vehicle.


Carl has never appeared in the 14th episode of a season.


Carl is one of six characters in the 
The Walking Dead
 universe to receive a permanent eye injury, the other four being his comic series 
counterpart
, 
Philip Blake
 (along with his own comic series 
counterpart
), 
Kenny
 and 
Violet
 
(Determinant)
 from 
The Telltale Series
.

Ever since he lost his right-eye, Carl's been trying to aim with his left-hand despite being right-handed.


It is revealed in the episode "Honor" that the flash-forward sequences seen in this episode and the season premiere "
Mercy
" were fantasies thought up by Carl for a brighter future after the war. These fantasies reveal that he sees peace among all communities and that he even views 
Negan
 as redeemable.


Carl is the third main character to die in a mid-season premiere, the first being 
Tyreese Williams
, the second being 
Jessie Anderson
, and the fourth being 
Alden
.


Carl is the third main character to commit suicide, the first being 
Andrea Harrison
 and the second being 
Sasha Williams
.

He is the second main character to commit suicide to prevent reanimation after being bitten, with Andrea being the first one to do so.


He is the first male main character to commit suicide.


Carl's last words were "I love you, Dad".


Following Carl's death, Rick, 
Carol Peletier
, and 
Daryl Dixon
 are now the only remaining 
Atlanta Camp
 survivors that are still alive. This also makes them and 
Morgan Jones
 the only remaining characters introduced in 
Season 1
 who are still currently living on the show.


Carl is the fifth main character to predecease his comic counterpart, with the first being 
Sophia Peletier
, the second 
Dale Horvath
, the third being 
Lori Grimes
, the fourth being 
Andrea Harrison
, the sixth being 
Jesus
, the seventh being 
Siddiq
, the eighth being 
Beta
, the ninth being 
Sebastian Milton
, and the tenth being 
Lance Hornsby
.


Carl is the second character to die, who does not die in the comics, with the first being 
Sophia Peletier
, the third being 
Jesus
, the fourth being 
Siddiq
, the fifth being 
Sebastian Milton
, and the sixth being 
Lance Hornsby
.


Carl is the ninth most-appearing character on the TV Series, having appeared in 83 episodes.


Carl is the sixth main character to be bitten by a walker, the first being 
Hershel Greene
, the second being 
Andrea Harrison
, the third being 
Bob Stookey
, the fourth being 
Tyreese Williams
, the fifth being 
Deanna Monroe
, and the seventh being 
Rosita Espinosa
.


Carl is the fourth main character to die by being shot in the head, with the first being 
Dale Horvath
, the second being 
Andrea Harrison
, the third being 
The Governor
, the fourth being 
Beth Greene
, and the sixth being 
Leah Shaw
.


Carl is the first character whose death was caused by 
Siddiq
, albeit indirectly and accidentally.


Carl appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
", "
A New Deal
" and "
Outpost 22
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Carl appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode, "
Rest in Peace

Rest in Peace
