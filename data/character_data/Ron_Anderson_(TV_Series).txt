Overview
[
]


Ron is initially introduced as an intelligent and polite young man living life in the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 with his family. He starts out as being friendly and welcoming toward 
Carl
 and accepts him as a friend. Although it is never shown, Ron is physically scarred from the abuse received from his violent father, 
Pete
, as shown when his 
mother
 asks him to lift his left arm up above his head, a task Ron clearly cannot do. Ron does not seem to be emotionally damaged, as opposed to his younger brother, 
Sam
.

Following the execution of his father at the hands of 
Rick
, Ron takes a dramatic turn for the worst. He becomes angered, traumatized, and vengeful for his father's death and develops an apparent hatred for Rick and Carl (whom Ron accuses of stealing his girlfriend, 
Enid
). He views Rick as a dangerous murderer and is disgusted by the fact that his mother chooses to remain Rick's friend, completely ignoring the fact Ron's own father was also dangerous and a killer. Ron is shown to become furious at any sign of disrespect toward his father, such as when Jessie mentions that Pete was dangerous and when Carl refers to Pete as an 'asshole'. This is evidence that Ron did indeed love his father despite the abuse received from him.

Ron is also shown to be rather cunning. He intentionally seeks out Rick's advise regarding gun training, claiming that he wants to protect himself and his family; although, Ron's true intentions involve murdering Carl. Following a massive invasion of walkers into the Safe-Zone, Ron attempts to fulfill his goal of killing Carl by locking Carl in his garage and attacking him, but Carl manages to stop Ron and takes his gun. As a result, Ron appears to have given up his murderous intentions and goes along with Rick's plan of escaping. However, once his brother and mother are killed by the walkers, Ron completely snaps, blaming Rick for their deaths and attempting to kill Rick once and for all. Before Ron is able to pull the trigger, 
Michonne
 stabs him through the chest with her sword, causing him to then be devoured by walkers. However he manages to pull the trigger before he dies and ends up shooting Carl in the eye.

Season 6
[
]


"
First Time Again
"
[
]


Hours after his father is killed by Rick, Ron storms out of his house in anger. He stumbles across Enid and Carl sitting on a rooftop holding hands and looks on jealously.

Ron is upset about his father's death by Rick. He watches from a bush as Deanna tells Rick to bury Pete's corpse out in the woods. Ron follows Rick and newcomer 
Morgan Jones
 into the woods. He is later seen running from walkers, tripping on a rock along the way. As he is about to fall to his death, unaware of the cliff edge, Rick tackles him as the walkers chasing him fall to their death, saving his life. Rick asks him why he is so far from Alexandria, and he tells him that he wanted to know where his father was buried. Rick gives Ron some advice on how to survive, but he shrugs it off. He later watches as Rick and Morgan bury Pete's corpse in the woods, and returns to Alexandria.



"
JSS
"
[
]


Jessie calls Ron to cut his hair, an excuse to talk about what happened, but Ron doesn't want to comply. When Jessie says that Pete was a dangerous man, Ron snaps that Rick 
is
 dangerous. He storms off, later seen being comforted by Enid.

During the attack, he tries to escape a 
Wolf
, getting saved by Carl. Due to his relationship with Carl strained by Rick's killing of his father, he refuses his help and goes to his house. He arrives just in time to witness his mother stabbing a Wolf woman to death with a pair of scissors.



"
Now
"
[
]


Ron is first seen listening to Rick's speech about the 
herd
. He looks at Carl and grips his knife. Later he plays with his knife, leading Carl to ask him if he's okay. "Why wouldn't I be?" he blurts.

Carl tells him that Enid left, and asks for his help in looking for her. Ron refuses, saying she might be dead, and that he's not helping him.

"This isn't for me," he says. "It's for Enid. Your friend." "My girlfriend," Ron corrects him.

He then says that it's a stupid and dangerous thing to do, leading Carl to storm off. Ron says he won't let Carl go and tries to stop him, but Carl pushes him away and the two brawl. Carl gets the upper hand and leaves him on the ground. Ron exclaims that he'll tell Rick, and that people will go out looking for him and will end up dying.

"You saved my life and now I'm saving yours," he finishes.

Later, he approaches Rick on the catwalk by the gate, seeing a herd for the very first time. He tells Rick what happened to Enid, and how Carl wanted to go after her. Rick thanks, and before he can go, Ron admits that what Rick said to him back at the quarry, about him not knowing how to defend himself, is true, and asks him to teach him how to use a gun.



"
Heads Up
"
[
]


Ron begins to take gun lessons with Carl and Rick, continuously watching Carl during the lesson when the former tries to advise him. Later, Ron distracts 
Olivia
 and sneaks into the armory and steals ammunition for the handgun that Rick gave him. Ron is seen following Carl down the street, his hand on the gun behind his back.



"
Start to Finish
"
[
]


Ron first appears when he, Carl, Michonne and Gabriel come across Rick and Deanna as they all flee from the massive herd that have entered Alexandria through the destroyed part of the community's wall. They are then cornered by another group of walkers from the heard ahead of the road they are running on. Jessie then appears, shoots at the walkers and lets them into their house.

Ron goes into the garage so Carl follows to check on him. Ron says that everyone is dead but Carl reassures they'll make it. Ron then locks the door and draws his gun, intent on killing Carl. Carl is able to knock the gun out of Ron's hand and the two engage in a short fight. Ron grabs a shovel and almost hits Carl with it, but instead hits one of the windows, attracting the walkers outside towards it. He is able to push Ron off of him, just in time as the walkers reach outside the window he was pinned on.

Eventually, Rick and Jessie are able to open the garage's door just as the walkers come in. Carl then follows Ron and holds him at gunpoint and tells him to give him his gun before telling him that his dad, referring to Pete, was an asshole.

He is later seen trying to hold the makeshift defenses they made around the house, just as the herd begins to break in through the front door and windows. He and the others retreat upstairs where Rick and Michonne kill and carry two walkers and decide to use their blood and organs to mask their scent to blend in with the herd below to escape.

Ron then has to cover himself with walker guts to try and get through the herd with everyone. They all then leave and stand at the front of Jessie's front porch, where he, Rick, Michonne, Jessie, Gabriel, Carl and Sam look on as the streets of Alexandria are now overrun by the herd. They all hold hands together and make their way through the herd undetected, as Sam calls for Jessie multiple times.



"
No Way Out
"
[
]


Ron, alongside Rick, Michonne, Jessie, Gabriel, Carl and Sam, are holding each hands together while slowly making through the herd, when Rick changes his mind that they are not going to the armory, instead heading towards their vehicles to lure the walkers back to the quarry. As night falls, they continue journeying for their cars only to be stopped by Sam who begins to cry and causes attention. When Sam gets devoured by the walkers, Jessie suffers a mental breakdown and screams for her son before getting devoured herself. As she is taken down by walkers, she is seen still holding Carl's hand and won't let go. Rick, who has no other choice chops her arm off in order for Carl to break free. This causes Ron to furiously aim his gun on Rick, blaming him for his family's demise. He is then stopped by Michonne who stabs him through his chest from the back with her katana. In a shocking state of mind, he shoots the gun in reflex. The stray bullet hits Carl's right eye, effectively blinding him as Ron collapses. Ron's body is then devoured by the surrounding walkers.

Michonne Hawthorne


Before he can pull the trigger, he is stabbed in the chest by Michonne. As Ron dies, he shoots the pistol in reflex, which results in Carl losing his right eye. His corpse is subsequently devoured by the herd, so it is unknown if he reanimated, put down, or was completely devoured.

Season 5




"It's in a garage. Little kids go in the morning and it's us in the afternoon. I mean, probably you too, right?"
- Ron to Carl about them going to school, "
Remember
"





"Wanna play some video games? Or Mikey's house has a pool table, but his dad's... kind of 
strict
 about it. (…) Sorry, I guess we... come on kind of strong. We can just hang out. Yeah, it took Enid three weeks to say something."
- Ron asking Carl what he wants to do, "
Remember
"





"Sorry, I guess we... come on kind of strong. We can just hang out. Yeah, it took Enid three weeks to say something."
- Ron asking Carl what he wants to do, "
Remember
"





Season 6




"I don't care what you think."
- Ron as Rick lectures him about being outside the walls, "
First Time Again
"





"No. I don't-- I don't want a 
haircut!
 (…) This is bullshit! This is just you trying to talk to me! (…) What-- are you serious?! (…) 
Rick is dangerous!
 Is he your friend?!"
- Ron arguing with Jessie about Rick, "
JSS
"





"Not since I saw her with 
you.
 (…) What makes you think she isn't 
dead?
 (…) I'm not helping you, Carl. 
("This is for Enid. Your friend.")
 My 
girlfriend.
 Or I mean 'cause she 
was
 anyway, right? (…) I told her to stop going over the wall, I told her there's bad people out there, and that it's 
stupid
 and 
dangerous.
"
- Ron arguing with Carl about Enid, "
Now
"





"I'll tell your dad! He'll go out there to find you, then other people will too, and then somebody's gonna 
die.
 Huh? You saved my life and now I'm saving 
yours.
"
- Ron to Carl as he goes out to find Enid, "
Now
"





"Enid, she uh... she used to sneak over the walls, spend time out there. I don't know why, she just wanted to, but um... I think she went out there after the
 attack
. We don't know where she is. You know, but she knows how to take care of herself. And we can't go out there. Carl wanted to try. I stopped him, I told him I'd tell you if he did and then um... I don't know I just thought I should tell you-- Yeah, he's back at the house, I saw him on the porch with Judith. I can keep guard if you want."
- Ron to Rick about Enid going outside the walls, "
Now
"





"So I was thinking about what you said back at the quarry. I mean, you're right, I need to know how to protect 
myself
, and my 
mom
 and 
brother
, this 
place
. So can you teach me how to 
shoot?
"
- Ron asking Rick to teach him how to shoot, "
Now
"





"Can I shoot it? Maybe, like, down at the walkers. (…) Well, what about like target practice in the center of town, 'cause then the sound will spread out in each direction, or maybe we could use 
silencers
 or something like that. But uh... I mean we probably don't want to waste the bullets right now, huh. Just want to learn more."
- Ron asking Rick if he can shoot his gun, "
Heads Up
"





"Enid's dead... we're 
all
 dead. (…) That's bullshit! Your dad's just gonna get more people killed, 'cause that's what he does, that's who he 
is
. Your dad's a 
killer
."
- Ron to Carl about Rick, "
Start to Finish
"





"I'm dead, Carl. My mom is dead. My brother is. You're dead... you're dead too. 
We're all dead.
"
- Ron to Carl before attempting to kill him, "
Start to Finish
"





"Hey, you can do this. Sam, just look at mom."
- Ron to Sam as he freezes up in the middle of a herd, "
No Way Out
"





"You... 
You.
"
- Ron's last words as he points his gun at Rick, "
No Way Out
"
