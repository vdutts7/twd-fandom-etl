Overview
[
]


R.J. is a cheerful, amiable, innocent, and benevolent child. After the disappearance of his father, 
Rick Grimes
, R.J. can be seen as part of his legacy that lives on. He is shown to get along with the rest of the kids well, often seen playing with them. He is apparently extremely bright as 
Sebastian Milton
 mentions that R.J. has recently jumped two grades in school.

According to Michonne, R.J. has inherited both of his parents' stubbornness and Rick's kind heart which is the trait in her son that reminds Michonne the most of her husband. Michonne tells Rick that R.J. and Judith would tell each other the story of what their father did and R.J. nicknamed Rick 
"The Brave Man"
 and himself 
"Little Brave Man"
 as a result. Michonne also tells Rick that no one has ever called R.J. 
"Junior"
 and suggests that R.J. might like a 
hatchet
 as a weapon like his father did.

Whisperer
 mask falls out. Judith gets scared and informs the rest of the group.

A while later, Judith tells R.J. the story about Rick blowing the bridge to save his friends. 
"He died and went to heaven,"
 Judith tells R.J. about "the brave man" in her story. Michonne walks up to hug them, telling them she'd do anything to protect them. Suddenly, an explosion rings out and everyone looks up to witness streaks of fire cascading from the sky. R.J. then stays at the camp alongside his sister.

father
's hat and Daryl's vest. However, the caravan doesn't make it far before they hit a roadblock and discover that the scouts they sent earlier are dead.

In their apartment, Carol is taking care of Judith, R.J., and Gracie while Daryl and Aaron are away. She looks at pictures of Sebastian trying to blend and go unnoticed, taken by Kelly.

Shira

 recovers her weapons and looks at the 
Coalition

Michonne
 had told her, a secret saying that Michonne had used to share with 
Rick
 that was like a good luck charm, one that is for Judith and R.J. too. Recognizing that it was one of many things that she was afraid to say out loud, Judith muses that they didn't know when they started this, that this would be the day that everything changed forever. Judith gives her little brother her hat, the same way that 
Carl
 had passed it down to her before his death.

As everyone prepares to leave to go after 
Pamela Milton
, 
Daryl
 promises R.J. that they will be back soon and orders him to look after Judith. However, Judith tells Daryl and 
Carol
 that she's coming too over Daryl's objections. Judith reminds her friends that this isn't the future that Carl wanted and it's not what Rick and Michonne fought for, not yet at least. What they're doing could help everyone, maybe everybody everywhere, not just them. Judith wants to be a part of making what her family believed in real. Carol recognizes that while everyone else has been focused on the present for a long time, Judith has been thinking about the future which is a good thing and something that they could all do a little more of.

old congregation

Jerry
 and 
Nabila
, walking through town as their daughters play outside, smile at them. Aaron admits that he never thought that they'd get back to any of this, although he had hope. Aaron calls them all very lucky, but Gabriel corrects Aaron that it's effort rather than luck. They have a lot to be proud of in their family, community, and future.

The group from the Commonwealth next visits a rebuilt and thriving 
Hilltop
 where 
Maggie
 and 
Hershel
 watch as 
Adam
 plays. Carol asks Maggie what she had wanted to talk about, and Maggie reveals that she wants to talk about the future. 
"There's a lot out there to find out about. And I think it's time we did."


At the side of the road, Judith, R.J. and 
Ezekiel
 join Daryl and Carol as he prepares to depart on his motorcycle. Daryl hugs the kids and R.J. promises him that he will be good while Judith promises to keep an eye on 
Dog
 for him. Daryl asks Judith to keep an eye on Carol and promises her that if he sees or hears anything about 
Rick
 and 
Michonne
 while he's out there, he will find them both and bring them home. Calling him Uncle Daryl, Judith states that Daryl deserves a happy ending too and Daryl promises to come back. Daryl hugs Ezekiel goodbye and he leads the kids to the top of the wall to watch Daryl's departure. Daryl and Carol hug and admit that they love each other before Daryl drives off on his motorcycle through the Commonwealth gate, setting off through the countryside on his 
new journey

Looking out over the fields of the Commonwealth, Judith tells her brother that 
"we get to start over. We're the ones who live."

Gone

While attacking 
CRM
 soldiers at a helicopter that she and 
Nat
 had downed, 
Michonne
 has several flashbacks, including ones of her kids. The last soldier proves to be 
Rick
, much to his and Michonne's mutual shock. Later, Michonne contemplates telling Rick about R.J., but decides to wait until after they've escaped from the CRM.



"
What We
"


In an attempt to get 
Rick
 to return home to 
Alexandria
, 
Michonne
 reveals R.J.'s existence to him as Rick had never known that she was 
pregnant
 when he disappeared. Michonne later tells Rick about their son. Rick is shocked to learn of his sons existence and though he continues to try and push Michonne to return home without him, he does ask about R.J.



"
The Last Time
"


After Michonne finally manages to make contact with Judith through her radio, R.J. and his sister wait in a field in or near the Commonwealth as a helicopter carrying their parents decents.

Rick and Michonne step out of the helicopter and rush greet their children, having finally returned home, although Rick hesitates briefly after having been away for so long and missed so much of Judith and R.J.'s lives. Sobbing, Judith hugs her father, telling Rick that she knew that he was still out there, "I just never wanted you to feel alone". Rick admits that he thought that he was, before realizing that he wasn't. Judith tells Michonne that she got her back and Michonne reminds her daughter that Judith told her to. Meeting his father for the first time, R.J. asks if he's the Brave Man which Rick and Michonne confirm. Touching R.J.'s hat, which had once been Rick's before he'd passed it down to his children, Rick tells his son to call him Dad. R.J. states that he knew that Rick would come back, that he believed it. Rick and R.J. hug for the first time which turns into a group hug of the reunited Grimes family as CRM helicopters fly overhead, carrying supplies to help other communities in need.

Trivia
[
]


R.J. is the sixth known child in the TV Series to be born into the apocalypse, the first being his sister 
Judith Grimes
, the second and third being two unnamed infants living at the 
Kingdom
, the fourth being 
Gracie
, and the fifth being 
Hershel Rhee
, the seventh being 
Ezra
, the eighth being 
Aliyah
, and the ninth being 
Mariam
.


R.J. is the only member of the Grimes family who did not have his own direct 
Comic Series
 counterpart.


R.J. is Rick's only known living blood relative in the series. From his older half-brother 
Carl
's death in "
Honor
" until his revealed birth in "
Who Are You Now?
", Rick had no known living blood relatives.


R.J. and Judith are the first adoptive siblings to appear on the show.


R.J.'s codename is "Little Brave Man".


In "
A New Deal
", R.J. is seen reading 
Invincible
, Robert Kirkman's other comic series.

This is also a reference to when his older half-brother, 
Carl
, was also reading 
Invincible
 in "
The Next World
".


As of "
Family
", R.J. is the only member of the Grimes family to not have been shot.

His father Rick was shot three times. The first time by an 
unnamed criminal
 in "
Days Gone Bye
", the second by 
Alisha
 in "
Too Far Gone
" and the third time by 
Jadis
 in "
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
".


His mother Michonne was shot in the leg by 
Merle Dixon
 in "
Hounded
".

Michonne was also shot in the chest by Merle's brother Daryl in a hallucination she had in "
What We Become
".


Lori Grimes
 was shot in the head by Carl to prevent reanimation in "
Killer Within
".


His half brother Carl was shot twice, once in the stomach by 
Otis
 in "
What Lies Ahead
" and once in the left eye by 
Ron Anderson
 in "
No Way Out
". Both times were accidental.


His sister Judith was shot in the shoulder by 
Pamela Milton
 in "
Family
".


While unconfirmed, it's likely that R.J.'s great-grandfather was shot at some point during his time serving in World War II.


The original ending of the show had a time-skip of at least 10 years, and an adult R.J. was shown driving in a van with Judith, Gracie, Socorro and Ezra searching for other survivors to bring back to their community.  In this deleted scene, R.J. refers to himself as "Rick Grimes", and is portrayed by 
Roland Buck III
.
[1]


In "
Deux Amours
" of 
The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon
, 
Daryl
 lists R.J. as one of his friends that he misses in America when 
Laurent
 asks Daryl about his friends. Laurent later names R.J. in his prayers since Daryl doesn't pray.


Rick was unaware of his son's existence until "
What We
" of

Become
" of 
The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live
