Overview
[
]


Unlike most of his fellow Saviors who tend to have a rough and often volatile nature, Alden is level-headed and tends to avoid violence and bloodbaths if he can help it, shown when he immediately surrendered to the Militia and talked his fellow men into doing the same instead of starting more bloodshed. In the makeshift prison at Hilltop, he deliberately bumped 
Jared
 and told him to not cause any more trouble after already risking their lives twice with escape attempts. Alden appeared to take up a leadership role with the Savior prisoners, attempting to negotiate with 
Maggie
 on their behalf. In return, Maggie appeared to treat Alden as the leader of the prisoners and showed him a level of respect that many of the others didn't receive.

As he spends more time as a prisoner of 
the Militia
, Alden becomes more and more disillusioned with the Saviors. After 
Simon
 shows no care for the prisoners, Alden cuts all ties with the Saviors and states that the Saviors aren't his people anymore when sent to bury the dead Saviors. Alden's disillusionment goes so far that he chooses to stay at the Hilltop willingly rather than return to the Saviors when given the chance despite knowing that the Saviors' lack of care towards the prisoners means that he no longer has any strategic value to the Militia.

Months later, Alden is shown to be a prominent figure within the communities, to the point of voicing his opinions to 
Rick
. He is shown to be helpful, easy-going, and brave. He is now a completely trusted member of the group, becoming an apprentice with 
Earl
 and entering a relationship with 
Enid
. However, he becomes vengeful against the 
Whisperers
 after they killed Enid. He is shown to be somewhat hypocritical, treating 
Lydia
 and 
Gamma
 harshly due to being former Whisperers, even though he was once in a similar position as a former Savior. He eventually loses his grudge against Gamma after seeing her affection for her 
nephew
. 

Alden is shown to still retain his humanity, as he was one of only two people to attempt to save 
Gage
. He is angered when the group lets Gage die. When he is badly injured, he is shown to care more about the people of 
Alexandria
's lives more than his own. Not wanting to slow the group down, he stays behind in a church. By the time, Maggie returns for him, he is already dead. Maggie is shown to be greatly saddened by his death, showing how far their friendship had come.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[

Nothing is known about Alden's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was born in 1990 and had at least one brother, and a father who was apparently not a very good parent. He appears to have an engineering or construction background as Alden was employed by 
the Saviors
 to determine what it would take to turn 
an abandoned bar
 into an outpost and to figure out a way to reinforce their defenses at the 
Satellite Outpost
.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At an unknown point, Alden's brother was murdered. Alden took revenge on the killers, but it didn't make him feel better as he expected. 

Alden eventually joined the 
Saviors
 as a worker. At some point, he was sent to check out 
an abandoned dive bar
 located between the 
Sanctuary
 and the 
Hilltop
 to determine what it would take to turn it into a Savior outpost. Alden apparently determined that it was impossible to turn the bar into an outpost as it was left abandoned by the Saviors.

Some time after the 
Satellite Outpost
 was 
ambushed
 by Rick and the Alexandrians, Alden was among the Saviors dispatched to the outpost to erect a fence surrounding the satellite station, to keep out walkers and any future invaders.

Content








"
The Damned
"


Alden is attempting to flee the 
Satellite Outpost
 with the remaining Saviors, but is forced to surrender to 
the Militia
 remarking that "living sounds good" after being surrounded. He encourages his fellow Saviors to surrender as well.



"
Monsters
"


Alden is among the Saviors being transported to the 
Hilltop
. When walkers approach the survivors and Saviors, 
Jared
 and his chained group seize an opportunity to flee into the woods. When Alden's chained group attempt to do the same, he trips them, citing the Militia has guns and they do not. After Jared's group is recaptured, they are brought to the Hilltop.



"
The King, the Widow, and Rick
"


Alden is outside the wall with the other prisoners. He questions 
Jesus
 of what they are building inside, while asking 
"Why do they call you Jesus?"
. The next morning, he joins the prisoners as they get escorted inside the Hilltop. 

When all of the Saviors are inside, 
Dianne
 starts to lock the gate up but then 
Jared
 tries to run out but is smacked in the head with a sniper by 
Maggie.
 Alden then thanks Maggie for not killing them all. When he sees Jared attempt to free himself with a piece of wood, he bumps into him because he does not want to get in trouble.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


Alden and the other Saviors are resting in the cage when Maggie demands Dean to be let out. Knowing what she is about to do, Alden tries to stop her from killing Dean, but Dean shuts him up and gives a short, wise speech, before Maggie shoots him in the cheek, killing him. Maggie angrily asks Alden if he wants to die next, and he relents.



"
Dead or Alive Or
"


Alden approaches Maggie, speaking up for the rest of the Saviors and attempting to come to an agreement, suggesting that the prisoners be allowed supervised freedom every once in a while for a few minutes each. Maggie refuses, and reveals that they are removing their rations for a few days, much to the shock of the Saviors and Alden.

Later, Maggie returns to the holding pen and agrees to Alden's deal, allowing a maximum of two Saviors at any given time out of the pen for work, exercise and, if the need arises, medical attention.



"
Do Not Send Us Astray
"


When 
the Saviors
 arrive at the 
Hilltop
, Maggie brings out the Savior prisoners and threatens to kill each one if the Saviors don't leave, even allowing Alden to talk to 
Simon
. However, Simon makes it clear that he doesn't care if the prisoners live or die, completely disillusioning Alden. During the attack, Alden tries to stay outside to help, but is sent back inside. The next morning, after the attack is repelled, 
Maggie
 allows Alden, guarded only by 
Kal
, to bury the dead Saviors outside the Hilltop walls. Alden makes it clear to Maggie that he no longer considers the Saviors his people although thanks her for still considering them people and for allowing him to bury them.

That night, an armed 
Henry
 arrives to the pen, demanding to know which Savior killed his brother and threatening to kill everyone if the killer doesn't step forward. Alden attempts to talk Henry down, using his own experiences with his brother's killers as why revenge won't make him feel better. Suddenly an 
injured Savior
 reanimates and attacks the rest the of the prisoners, allowing Jared to push Henry and take his weapon, leading the other prisoners away.

Shortly afterwards, 
Siddiq
 checks on the prisoners and is left struggling with a walker when Alden unexpectedly kills the walker with a shovel and saves Siddiq's life. Maggie arrives and threatens Alden who explains what happened and that while some of the prisoners ran, the others didn't and are trying to close the gates against a walker 
herd
 that was drawn to the Hilltop by the earlier battle. As 
Dianne
 and several Militia members go to help, Alden tells Maggie that he doesn't know where the escapees went. He points out that Maggie heard how the prisoners mean nothing to 
Negan
 and Simon and that while this fact means that the prisoners don't mean much to Maggie's people either, he explains 
"those of us that stayed, stayed. We had plenty of chances to run."
 Maggie appears to accept Alden's explanation.



"
Still Gotta Mean Something
"


Alden helps clean up the mess around the 
Saviors
' former prison. He is approached by 
Rick
 for information on where 
Jared
 and the escaped Savior prisoners may have gone. Alden states that they likely went to the 
Sanctuary
, but informs Rick of 
a dive bar
 he'd scouted for the Saviors as a potential outpost between the Hilltop and the Sanctuary the escaped prisoners may have gone to. 

Before Rick leaves, Alden pleads with him only to kill who he must and to give the rest of the Savior prisoners the choice to come back to the Hilltop. Though Rick agrees, he obviously doesn't mean it. That night, Alden is sitting around a campfire with 
Dianne
 when Rick and 
Morgan
 return. Exchanging a look with Rick as he walks inside, Alden realizes that Rick killed all of the escaped Saviors.



"
Wrath
"


At Alden's request, 
Maggie
 allows him and the other Savior defectors to draw away the walker 
herd
 that has been at the Hilltop since 
Simon
's attack. Alden succeeds, but upon his return is accosted by 
Morgan
 who is suspicious of his activities until Maggie and Alden explain. When Alden tries to offer help to the departing members of the 
Militia
, Maggie makes it clear that although the Savior defectors are allowed to stay at the Hilltop, they are not considered part of the Militia.

When the Saviors approach Hilltop later that day, Alden takes part in the evacuation and is surprised when 
Tara
 decides to stay behind to help. He chooses to stay as well and gets the other Savior defectors to do the same. Armed with guns supplied by Tara, the former Saviors prepare to defend the Hilltop, but 
Aaron
 arrives with the women of 
Oceanside
 who firebomb the attacking Saviors, preventing a battle.

After the defeat of the Saviors, Alden approaches Maggie and asks to remain at the Hilltop. Though the other defectors are returning to the 
Sanctuary
, Alden has never felt like he belonged there. Having read 
Georgie
's "A Key to the Future", Alden suggests that he can help make the things depicted in the book become a reality. After a moment's consideration, Maggie agrees to let Alden stay at the Hilltop and help build up the community.

"
A New Beginning
"


Alden and the group go to the Smithsonian in 
Washington, D.C.
, to search for a covered wagon and farming equipment. However, he stays outside as a lookout along with Tara, Aaron and Jesus.

Shortly after, the group leaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities.

On the road, Alden talks to 
Ken
 and 
Marco
 about blacksmithing at the Hilltop.

Daryl and Rosita catch up with everyone to inform them that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Rick tells Tara, Gabriel, Aaron and Anne to head back to Alexandria and the rest will go to an alternate route and spend the night at the Sanctuary.

In the woods, the wagon gets caught in the mud as walkers appear from the bushes. It finally budges and everyone rushes to gather the supplies until the walkers overwhelm them and they're forced to leave. Ken runs back to free his horses but is bitten in the arm by a walker and then kicked in the ribs by the horse.

Siddiq and Enid try to save him but Ken succumbs to blood loss and dies from his injuries. A saddened Maggie sobs by his side before putting him down.

At night, in Hilltop, Alden sings during Ken's funeral. Later, as Maggie is being attacked by a hooded stranger, Alden and Cyndie grab the assailant and Maggie rips off his hood to reveal a drunken Earl.

The next day, at night, the residents, including Alden, gather around the gallows as Maggie explains to her people that the punishment fits the crime. She looks on at Gregory, who has a noose around his neck and is sitting on a horse. Gregory pleads for someone to stop this, but no one moves. A couple of kids show up and Michonne yells for Maggie to stop but it's too late as Daryl smacks the horse and it rides off, leaving Gregory to hang to death to everyone's shock.

Maggie tells her people that she wants this to be the last time they do something like this and then orders Daryl to cut off the noose.



"
The Bridge
"


On the river, Alden arrives to inform that Rick that none of the deserter Saviors made it back to Sanctuary and their families are worried. When Rick says he won't give the Saviors guns because he will protect them, Alden reminds him that was Negan's way. Before he can answer, Tara radios to warn him that the second siren didn't go off and the herd is coming.

When the herd arrive at the labor site and a commotion ensues, Alden arrives with Rick and the others to help.



"
Warning Signs
"


At the camp, the Saviors are furious with the news of Justin's death. Alden promises they'll get to the bottom of it but is punched in the face by Jed, who claims he isn't one of them anymore. Carol steps in with her gun at her hip, stopping Jed.

Alden watches the crowd drawing their guns as the Saviors start accusing Daryl and Anne of being the culprits. They grab axes to retaliate when Rick rides in the middle of the group with his gun drawn and warns everyone to back off.

After they disperse, Alden asks Rick if some of the Saviors can receive guns but Rick says they need to figure out what happened first.



"
The Obliged
"


Although unseen, Alden is sent by Carol after the Saviors in an attempt to convince them to work on the bridge. However, the Saviors find out that the Oceansiders were the ones killing their people, and Jed somehow subdues Alden and takes his gun.



"
Evolution
"


Following Rick's presumed death, Alden became Earl's apprentice and entered a relationship with Enid.

Six years later, at Hilltop, Alden watches as Tara coldly greets Michonne and updates her on Eugene, Aaron, Daryl, and Rosita's situations. She then informs Magna's group that they'll have to wait for Jesus to return before deciding on their future, but they can stay until he gets back. Connie thanks her for everyone. 

Later, at Earl's blacksmithing spot, Enid checks up on Henry and jokes with him, before taking Alden aside and kissing him.



"
Adaptation
"


In Hilltop, Alden talks with Tara, Enid, 
D.J.
, and Marco to organize a search party to look for the rest since they haven't come back. Luke offers his help and goes out with Alden.

In the woods, Alden and Luke bond over music until they discover one of Yumiko's arrows on a tree. They kill some walkers and Luke suggests they follow the arrows to find their friends. They spot a herd nearby and ponder their new moves.

Later, Alden and Luke spot a walker staring at them motionless. Suddenly, they get surrounded by several Whisperers and the leader tosses them one of the arrows they've been following, points a shotgun at them, and says, 
"Trail ends here."




"
Bounty
"


At Hilltop, Alpha orders a couple of whisperers to bring up a tied up Alden and Luke. Alpha offers to Daryl to trade both of them for her daughter or she will kill them.

Meanwhile, a herd arrives and Alpha instructs her people to draw them away. Suddenly, a Whisperer's baby starts crying, which attracts the walkers over. Alpha shrugs at the mother, indicating she should leave the baby to die. Alden and Luke scream for them not to but Alpha explains it's natural selection. He then watches as Connie runs out of the cornfield, sling-shots a walker, and grabs it.

Later, Daryl hands Lydia over to Alpha in exchange for Alden and Luke. Enid then embraces Alden and says she will never let him go.

At night, Alden and Enid sleep together and make love inside their room. 



"
The Calm Before
"


In the Kingdom, Alden watches from the crowd as Ezekiel declares they've finally accomplished Rick, Carl, and Jesus' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. At the fair, Luke tries convincing Alden to perform with him despite losing a bet. Enid accidentally calls Alden her boyfriend, but he decides that it's ok and accepts to sing. Later that day, Alden sings along with Luke in their concert but he grows concerned after no seeing Enid around the crowd.

The next day, Alden listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news regarding the fate of the missing residents from the fair, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them. 



"
The Storm
"


Several months after the fair massacre, Alden and a group of Hilltop residents help the Kingdom residents travel safely and move to the Hilltop. On the road, the group spots walkers in a field but keep moving undetected. Alden asks Lydia if they're her people. 
"We followed their rules, haven't they done enough to us?"
 he asks her in anger, but is shut up by Daryl. 

Later, as more snow starts falling, Michonne decides to take the group to the Sanctuary for shelter during the night. In the Sanctuary, Alden listens as the leaders map their route through a frozen lake on Alpha's land and Michonne warns they have to leave now or they won't make it. The group gets ready and leave the Sanctuary.

In the woods, the group passes the pikes into Alpha's territory and Alden looks up solemnly at where Enid's head once was. Michonne kills frozen walkers, unsure if they're Whisperers or not, before reaching the frozen lake. Daryl notices Lydia's missing again, so Carol leaves to find her and instructs him to get everyone across safely. Suddenly, walkers awaken from the snow banks and the group kills them one by one before escaping across the ice.

In the morning, Alden and the group finally arrive at Hilltop, where Daryl knocks off the head of a frozen walker. That night, he helps the residents settle in the community.

"
Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Alden and the Coalition form a militia in order to train the several residents of the communities to face any future treats. He takes part in a training exercise on the Oceanside beach. As Ezekiel and Jerry methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Alden and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat. 

After a 
Whisperer
 mask is discovered on the Oceanside beach, Alden and Luke head out to investigate any other possible Whisperer sighting around the area. When Yumiko radios the group to inform they have found something, Alden catches up to the others in the woods where they have found an abandoned campsite full of corpses and a walker skin. Aaron declares one of the Whisperers has been here. 

That night, Alden and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. The group runs out of water as a herd of walkers approaches the group. With their backs to the fire, the group prepares for a fight.

Alden and the group take their formations and start fighting off the herd. As they keep killing the walkers, Daryl tosses an axe to cut a tree down and have it fall onto some walkers. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Alden is alerted to the commotion of a tree falling onto a house and a portion of Hilltop's walls. When the group debates if the Whisperers are responsible, Alden believes they are since they also took part of their hunting ground after they crossed into their border. He then helps the other residents rescue the trapped injured from the rubble. 

The next day, Alden and the other residents kill the incoming walkers with the help of the Alexandria convoy when the herd invades the community that night. The following morning, Alden helps load the supplies onto the cart for the parting group towards Oceanside and watches as they leave the community.



"
What It Always Is
"


Alden helps out around the community following their recent attack and informs Yumiko that Eugene has come up with a plan to salvage the fallen tree and use it to fix the wall. He also suggests to her that they should build up their defenses but she says is not the time.  

Later that day, Alden comforts a worried Yumiko to help make her feel better about the group searching for Kelly in the woods. When she leaves, Earl tells Alden the Whisperers will eventually return while he claims he hasn't forgotten about what they had lost.



"
Morning Star
"


Alden and Earl are constructing defenses on the Hilltop's walls, when they spot a group of Alexandrians approaching, although neither recognize Mary. When Earl asks Aaron about this, the latter reveals Mary to be a former Whisperer that has defected, and that she wishes to see her nephew, Adam. Earl promptly shoots down this notion, not trusting Mary. Alden agrees with Earl, and assures him that they will only allow the Alexandrians to see the 
doctor
.

Later, Mary spots Adam and attempts to talk to him, but is intercepted by Alden, who prevents her from doing so. Despite Mary's pleas and Aaron's attempts to reason with him, Alden remains adamant about keeping Adam separate from Mary.

With the Whisperers nearing with their horde everyone is gathered on the front lines including Alden. Kelly puts her palms on the ground and confirms that the horde is close. Indeed, the horde soon emerges from the bushes and approaches the Hilltop. While they are momentarily halted by the electric fence, the walkers soon break through it and approach the second line of defense. Aaron orders the survivors to split ranks. The shield-wielding survivors reinforce the makeshift barbed wire fence, while the melee weapon-wielding survivors start taking out the walkers. The archers, meanwhile, stay in the back and rain arrows on the herd. Behind the herd, Beta commands the Whisperers to launch the sap they collected earlier using makeshift catapults into the front lines, drenching most of the defenders as well as the Hilltop's walls. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltop resident ablaze. With no choice, the defenders begin to retreat towards the Hilltop, but are trapped when the Whisperers launch another volley of fire-arrows into the Hilltop's walls, setting the community ablaze.



"
Walk With Us
"


Alden takes part in the failed defense of the Hilltop, ultimately fleeing with 
Kelly
, 
Mary
, and 
Adam
. Having only reluctantly allowed Mary to join them, Alden angrily refuses her help with Adam despite his own troubles in soothing the baby. Mary finally gets Alden to accept her advice and help, taking the baby and successfully soothing him. Seeing Mary's obvious affection for Adam causes Alden to finally soften his attitude towards her and ask about 
her sister
, Adam's mother. When a herd arrives, Mary leads Alden, Kelly, and Adam to an abandoned van, but refuses to join them, instead leading the walkers away.

After Mary's brutal murder by 
Beta
, the reanimated Mary is suddenly put down by Alden with an arrow to the head before Beta can lead her back to the Whisperers. Before Alden can shoot him too, Beta flees, leaving Alden with Kelly and Adam, upset at Mary's sacrifice for them.



"
The Tower
"


Alden and Aaron watch over Beta from above inside the windmill. Alden communicates information about the Whisperers to Aaron via sign language. Beta nearly spots Alden, but ultimately decides to move on. From a distance, Alden and Aaron spy on the herd and radio their observations to Gabriel, noting that they are heading towards Oceanside as expected. Aaron tells him they will continue to follow the herd and notify them if anything changes. Shadowing the horde, Alden and Aaron notice it changing direction, so they try to call it in. Failing to get a signal, they decide to retreat, but before they can do so, they are surrounded by a group of Whisperers, 
one
 of which holds them at gunpoint.



"
A Certain Doom
"


Alden and Aaron manage to fight off the Whisperers, who are then further assisted Maggie Rhee, who had returned per the community's request to help end the Whisperer War, and her armed 
escort
. Aaron, along with Alden, Maggie, and Elijah, arrive at the abandoned hospital just in time to kill the invading Whisperers and help save Gabriel's life.

With the survivors killing many of the Whisperers, Daryl killing Beta, and Carol and Lydia leading the herd off a cliff into a ravine - the Whisperer War is efficiently ended. After the battle, Alden is seen when young Gracie is introduced to Maggie.

"
Acheron: Part I
"


Alden is part of a group consisting of Daryl, Elijah, Maggie, Carol, Jerry, Rosita, Lydia, Gabriel, Gage, Roy, Kelly, and Magna who raid the abandoned 
Fort Connors
 military base for food supplies. Alden and Daryl hoist the packs up. A pulley snaps. Daryl grabs the backpack before it can fall on top of the walkers, but he cuts himself on the arm, and a drop of his blood lands on a walker. The walker stirs, rousing all the other walkers in the room. Maggie's group starts slaying the walkers. Daryl and Alden hoist the crew up to safety one by one. After the mission, Alden returns to Alexandria with his fellow survivors.

Alden joins the mission to salvage food and water from Meridian to feed the large population in Alexandria. Part of a group consisting of Maggie, Daryl, Gage, Cole, Elijah, Roy, Negan, Frost, Duncan, Agatha, and Gabriel, the survivors utilize Negan's familiarity with the DC area to travel to Meridian. Due to the heavy rain storm, the survivors are forced to head into the subway tunnels to complete the journey. While in the tunnels, they come across hundreds of body bags, many containing walkers in them. At some point while dispatching the body bag walkers, Gage and 
Roy
 go missing, along with the group's ammo and supplies. Shortly after this realization, a large group of walkers appear, forcing the other survivors to move forward in the tunnel without being able to search for Gage or Roy.



"
Acheron: Part II
"


Alden and the rest of the group makes it inside the train car, but finds that the doors to the adjacent car are rusted shut. When Negan comes down, the group inquires about Maggie's whereabouts, to which Negan claims she was right behind him. Alden wishes to go back up and get her, but 
Frost
 dissuades him from this, as he considers it suicidal. Although clearly upset, 
Gabriel
 decides to continue the mission.

When they open the trap door, Maggie climbs into the subway car, revealed to have survived. Furious, she pistol-whips Negan for his betrayal, and explains to the others what had happened. Negan readily admits his culpability. Alden accuses Negan of trying to kill Maggie, but the latter corrects him, explaining that he simply opted not to save her when she was in trouble. The other Wardens threaten Negan, but he remains unrepentant, noting that Maggie openly admitted to wanting him dead. With that in mind, he doesn't see why he should have risked his life for her. He goes on to point out he has been a great asset to the group.

Alden reminds him that he burned Hilltop to the ground, but Negan retorts that he also killed Alpha and that, if he hadn't, every person they know would be dead. 
Agatha
 offers to kill Negan, assuring Maggie that they can get through the city without him. Before anything can happen, they hear someone yelling for help from the back of the train car. They find 
Gage
 trapped in the last car, unable to open the door. He explains that he and Roy got lost in the tunnels. Gage, however, neglected to close the door behind him when he entered the car, allowing walkers to pour in. Negan asks for help to pry the door open and let Gage in, but Maggie opposes this, as this would also allow walkers to get inside their car as well.  

In spite of this, Alden tries to help Negan open the door, but is prevented from doing so by 
Duncan
. Gage pleads with Maggie to save him, apologizing for his mistake and promising to do better. Alden also tries pleading with Maggie, but she is adamant that they don't have the ammo to clear the walkers. Gabriel supports Maggie's decision, while she regretfully informs Gage that she can't open the door for him. Bitter, Gage calls her a liar, before stabbing himself in the chest to spare himself the pain of being torn apart by walkers, which he is shortly after.

As Frost and Duncan try to open the door to the front car, Alden notices the group is avoiding looking at Gage, who has reanimated and wonders why. Gabriel coldly states that the zombified Gage is merely a shell of a man who died a coward. Alden protests that, while Gage might have been scared, he didn't deserve to die in the worst way imaginable. Maggie then says that there are worse ways to go and tells a story from her time alone with Hershel of a worse way to die than Gage did.

Alden and the rest of the group gets ready to fight the walkers. The door to the rear car finally breaks under the horde's mass, and walkers begin to descend on the survivors. Out of ammo, the survivors must resort to melee weapons. Luckily, Daryl reaches the blocked door in time and is able to open it. Once everyone's inside, he shoves a grenade into a walkers mouth and pushes it into the horde, before slamming the door shut and taking cover. In the ensuing explosion, the remaining walkers are killed.

Alden and the group finally makes it to the surface. Upon arriving to their location, the group is alarmed by the sight of bodies strung up all along the road they're on. Suddenly, the group is showered with arrows and throwing knives, killing Roy, and severely injuring Cole. As the group scrambles for cover, they see a group of 
Reapers
 advancing towards them.



"
Hunted
"


As the Reapers unleash their attack, the group scatters into the woods. Alden, Negan, and Gabriel are injured, while Cole is killed by one of the Reapers. As the group scatters, Alden manages to reach the shopping mall, where Maggie joins up with him, but before they can even catch their breath, both are attacked by a pair of Reapers. Maggie struggles against the Reaper she encountered earlier, but is eventually able to stab him in the neck with a broken bottle. Out of nowhere, Negan helps Maggie by finishing the Reaper off with his crowbar. Maggie throws a knife into the back of the remaining 
Reaper
, but before they can kill him, the Reaper throws a flashbang, stunning both Negan and Maggie. 

In the brief moments it takes them to recover, they find the Reaper gone, along with the body of the Reaper they managed to kill. Rushing to Alden's aid, Maggie finds that he has been gravely injured in the attack. Maggie tries to help Alden up, but Negan is flabbergasted that Maggie wants to keep going. He asks what the plan is, to which Maggie resolutely replies the plan doesn't change; they will reunite with the others and then retrieve the food. Negan retorts that the others might be dead, and lambasts Maggie's plan. 

Knowing quite a bit about theatrics, he observes that the Reapers demonstrated just how insane they are, and warns that they can't be on any road they might use. Maggie snaps back at Negan and invites him to come up with a better plan that doesn't result in them starving. Negan assures Maggie he is on her side, so Maggie asks him to help her carry Alden.

After taking a short break, Maggie determines they have 2 miles left to reach their destination. Continuing on, they hear a woman's screams while she's fighting walkers. Maggie and Alden hurry to help, much to Negan's chagrin. The woman turns out to be Agatha, defending a mortally wounded Duncan, who then dies of his earlier wounds and Maggie puts him down.

As the group continues on, Alden asks Maggie if she's okay. Maggie assures him she can handle Negan, but this isn't what Alden was talking about. He suspects that Alexandria isn't what Maggie thought she'd be coming home to, or the place she told Hershel about. Maggie says that not much surprises her anymore, but the destruction of Hilltop did. She adds that she isn't sure Hershel is surprised by a lot of things, either. Alden assures Maggie she'll rebuild it even better than it was, and that it will probably be done by the time Adam is old enough to remember. 

Maggie is surprised but delighted Alden is raising a child. Before Alden can tell Maggie what to do in case he dies, she cuts him off by promising to start the rebuilding process as soon as they get back. Soon, they arrive to the sight of a walker tied to a stake and charred to the bone. The sign above labels the walker as a "
Judas
". Suddenly, the group is surrounded by walkers. They try to fight their way out, but Agatha is bitten in the process. To ensure the others escape, Agatha sacrifices herself to the walkers. Negan forcibly pulls Maggie away as the walkers descend on Agatha, eating her alive.

Walking down the road, Maggie spots a 
church
 and decides they will take a break there. Inside, Maggie can sense Negan wants to leave Alden behind, so she shoots the idea right off the bat. Alden, however, implores her to do so, as he is slowing them down. Alden goes on to state that he walked away from Negan and the 
Saviors
 and joined Maggie because he trusts her to do the right thing, no matter how much it costs her. The supplies, Alden determines, are the only thing that matters, as without them their community starves, including Adam. Maggie says that Adam needs a father, but Alden retorts that he's not likely to make it out of 
Meridian
 alive being as injured as he is, and asks that she leave him like she left Gage. 

Maggie replies that Gage made his choice, to which Alden states that he is making his. Alden goes on to state that, if the plan fails, everything she worked for will have been for nothing, and Adam's fate is less than certain. Negan interjects, pointing out that the sun is going down and that Maggie needs to make a decision. Snapping back, Maggie supposes being reckless with another's life is easy for Negan. She firmly tells him he doesn't get to decide who lives and who dies anymore. She goes on to blame the situation on him, claiming Negan destroyed everything they've built. Negan is undeterred and insists she still has to decide nonetheless. With a heavy heart, Maggie decides to leave Alden after all, albeit with food and a knife to defend himself.



"
No Other Way
"


After defeating 
the Reapers
, 
Maggie
 returns to the 
church
 for Alden. As Maggie enters the church, she is attacked by a reanimated 
Reaper
 whom she quickly puts down. To Maggie's sorrow, she discovers a reanimated Alden crawling along the floor, Alden and the Reaper having killed each other. Crying, Maggie stabs Alden in the head and puts him down.

Maggie subsequently buries Alden's body nearby.

her
, and for us. Not for you. He's not yours, he'll 
never
 be. And you think I'm picking a fight? Think I'm being unreasonable? If I die tonight, it'll have been for everything we've been trying to build 
for him
."
- Alden to Mary and Aaron, "
Morning Star
"





Season 11




"You wanna know why I walked away from him... and everything he stood for... and joined up with you? It's 'cause I trust you... to do the 
right thing
. No matter how hard it is or how much it costs you. The supplies--Maggie, look at me. The supplies are the only thing that matters now. Alexandria needs us to do this. They're 
waiting
 for us. Hershel, and Judith... and 
Adam
. (…) You think I'm gonna make it out of that town alive like this? You left Gage. Leave 
me
. (…) Maggie, if this plan fails... then everything you worked for, everything you want for the future, it 
dies with it
. And then what happens to Adam?"
- Alden asking Maggie to leave him behind, "
Hunted
"





"You better come back."
- Alden's last words to Maggie before being left behind, "

"
