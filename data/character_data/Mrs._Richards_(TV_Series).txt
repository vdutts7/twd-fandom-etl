"
Made to Suffer
"
[
]


Mrs. Richards is among those woken up by the gunshots and explosions throughout town. After Rick's group leaves Woodbury and the fight ended, Mrs. Richards is summoned to the arena for an announcement. When it is revealed that Merle and his 
brother
 were captured and deemed responsible for the night's attacks, she and the others jeer and demand death for both perpetrators.



"
The Suicide King
"
[
]


Mrs. Richards continues to jeer as Merle and Daryl are forced to fight each other to the death. When 
Rick
 and 
Maggie
 begin shooting and throwing smoke grenades in the arena, Mrs. Richards flees the arena along with the other townspeople.



"
Welcome to the Tombs
"
[
]


Mrs. Richards stayed behind in Woodbury with the other senior citizens, children, and their mothers. She chatted with

Mrs. Richards was in Cell Block D when it was attacked by the infected prison residents. As her zombified 
husband
 wanders out of his cell, Mrs. Richards flees the chaos with 
Jeanette
 and a 
young man
 and is able to get to safety.



"
Indifference
"
[
]


While 
Daryl
 is on the run with 
Michonne
, 
Tyreese
, and 
Bob
 for medical supplies, he finds a stone and picks it up, mentioning that when Mrs. Richards went into Cell Block A, she asked him to find a jasper stone to be used as a marker for the grave of her husband, who died in the Cell Block D attack.



"
Internment

[
]


Having been taken to quarantine in Cell Block A, Mrs. Richards is sick from the flu and rests in her cell. When the bearded man collapses and dies, she watches the situation unfold from outside her cell. Later after the bearded man is taken away, Hershel returns and closes Mrs. Richards' cell. When some of the residents begin turning, Mrs. Richards remains in her cell and survives the chaos.



"

‚Üë
 
This character's husband, Mr. Richards was portrayed by Rob Fitts, a Woodbury extra from Season 3. Since Mr. Richards was from Woodbury, Mrs. Richards would have to be from Woodbury as well, and around the same age as Rob Fitts, leaving Leola Williams as the only candidate that fulfills the description of this role as there are no other older women from Woodbury at the prison.




‚Üë
 
Actress was scheduled to film for "Too Far Gone" and "Inmates", where her character was set to die, but was unavailable to work the filming dates. Regardless, her character has been killed off.
