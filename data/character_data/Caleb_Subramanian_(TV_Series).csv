,,,"Caleb is a helpful, caring, and hard-working doctor who helps anyone in need. After a flu breaks out in the prison, Caleb tries his best to help as many patients as possible until he himself is infected. Even when in his poor condition, Caleb still tries to help people, creating IVs for the infected, for well-knowing that he will also eventually die. He accepts this with dignity and prepares for the inevitable. He eventually reanimates and is put down by his good friend and fellow doctor 
Hershel
.","Almost nothing is known about Caleb's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was a doctor with special medical knowledge and training.","Dr. Subramanian is seen greeting 
Daryl Dixon
 in the prison yard under the dining pavilion as he reads from a book.
Dr. Subramanian managed to escape the chaos that overcame Cell Block D. After the zombified residents were put down, he tended to the injured survivors and later examined 
Charlie
's corpse. He discusses with 
Rick
, 
Tyreese
, 
Hershel
, 
Sasha
, 
Bob
, and Daryl about the illness affecting the prison group, stating that it's a type of flu that spreads quickly and proceeds to explain how.
Dr. Subramanian is seen treating a flu-stricken survivor with an amputated arm from the cell block attack. The man succumbed to the illness and is put down with a knife to the head. When Sasha falls ill, she starts looking for Caleb, until she finds out that he also has come down with the sickness. Since Caleb is no longer able to treat people, Hershel volunteers to fill his role. When Hershel is comforting Caleb, he accidentally coughs blood on Hershel's face and tells him he shouldn't be in there with him.
Dr. Subramanian creates IVs for the infected survivors, despite his rapidly deteriorating condition. He reveals to Hershel that he brought several shotguns with him for the inevitable. He shrugs off Hershel's attempts to persuade him that things aren't bad, believing that he has reached the end stage of the disease and will die no matter what. Later, during the chaos after several survivors reanimate, Hershel runs to his cell for help, only to find that he has died and reanimated. Hershel reluctantly breaks his arm, and stabs him through the eye. Hershel then takes one of Caleb's shotguns and uses it to kill the reanimated patients. After the chaos dies down, he comes back to Caleb's cell and closes his other eye before opening his Bible and reading through it. However, Hershel breaks down and weeps over the loss of his friend and the other prison residents.","Killed By
