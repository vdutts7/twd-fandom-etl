Overview
[
]


Erin is a kind-hearted and well-mannered woman. She has no experience outside the walls of 
Alexandria
, making her a rather weak survivor. She usually handles non-physical activities, such as cooking. She and 
Carol
 immediately form a friendship, with Erin often complimenting her cooking skill. When the 
Wolves
 attack Alexandria, Erin is unable to put up any fight against 
Aphid
 and merely pleads for him to spare her. Aphid slashes her stomach right before Carol kills him. Carol then puts Erin down out of mercy and proceeds to cry at the loss of her friend.

Reg
 about a woman part of the book club who's taking too long to read the only copy of their book. As

 and 
Tobin
 and listens to her fellow residents as they speak. Erin and the other residents are shocked when Rick suddenly arrives with the corpse of a walker as Tobin was speaking. She also witnesses the murder of

Erin is at the pantry with Carol,

the Wolves
 invade Alexandria later that day, Erin is attacked by 
Aphid
 outside her home and her abdomen is sliced open with a machete. After Carol kills Aphid immediately after, she stabs Erin in the head

 to prevent her cries from attracting any nearby Wolves. Carol then sits for a few moments, devastated at the loss of her friend.
