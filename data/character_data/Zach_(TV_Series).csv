,,,"Zach is shown to be friendly, helpful, and brave. He and Beth had entered a relationship and are seen flirting and joking around with each other. He joins the group on a supply run and helps save Bob Stookey who had gotten stuck under a shelf. However, this costs his life when he gets bitten by a walker. Strangely, Beth doesn't give much of a reaction towards his death since she has become desensitized towards the apocalypse, though she does state she's glad she met him.",Almost nothing is known about Zach's life prior to or as the outbreak began. He attended an unspecified college and was able to survive with his fellow schoolmates. They may have been part of a larger group before being recruited to the prison 6 weeks prior to his death. [1],"Zach is outside the prison with Daryl Dixon preparing to leave for the Big Spot supply run. While outside, Beth approaches him and kisses him. The two share some jokes with one another and Zach hops into the truck. Beth does not say goodbye to him. At the store, Zach sits outside with Daryl and Michonne, banging on the windows to attract the walkers inside. Zach informs Michonne of his and Daryl's ""game"", where he tries to guess Daryl's job before the outbreak. Zach tries again and guesses that Daryl was a homicide cop, which makes Michonne laugh. Daryl jokingly says he's right, but Zach doesn't believe him and repeatedly asks if he's kidding. Once they head inside, Zach sticks close to Daryl throughout the run. When Bob Stookey is trapped under an alcohol shelf, Zach and Daryl kill the walkers around the store and help lift the shelf off of Bob. After freeing Bob, Zach is suddenly grabbed and bitten by a crawling walker from under the collapsed shelf and is pulled down, much to everyone's horror. Zach has his neck torn open while he screams, and moments later a helicopter caving in the ceiling falls through and crushes Zach, putting him out of his misery. Back at the prison, Daryl delivers the news to Beth. She doesn't react much to the news saying she doesn't cry anymore and that it was nice to know him. In a flashback, Zach returns from a run with Rick , Glenn , and Maggie .","Killed By Bob Stookey (Indirectly Caused) After Bob sets the wine bottle back down on the shelf, the impact breaks the shelf, causing it to fall on him.
