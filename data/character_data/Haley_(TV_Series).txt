Overview
[
]


Haley is a very blunt and sarcastic girl. When talking with 
Andrea
, she generally is quite friendly with her, with the two opening up about the people they've lost. However, she can also be quite arrogant and overconfident. She boasts her skills with a bow, to the point of stating that her father wanted her to join the Olympics. However, when a walker approaches, her skills are quite unimpressive, missing all of her shots, forcing Andrea to go down and take it out with a knife. Haley is angered by this, stating she could've killed it despite just showing she can't even hit a slow-moving walker. However, overall she didn't seem to be malicious. When 
Rick
's group invades 
Woodbury
, Haley ends up being shot by 
Maggie
, which saddens Andrea.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Little¬†is known about Haley's life prior to or as the outbreak began. It is known that she owned a very expensive compound bow and her father wanted her to go to the Olympics. She also mentions having a brother.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Haley's father and brother became infected at an unknown time and she had to kill them. She eventually accepts the leadership of 
The Governor
 and accepts the job of defending the town.



Season 3
[
]


"
Hounded
"
[
]


Haley met 
Andrea
 while working on the wall. She told Andrea about her compound bow and how she had to kill her father and brother after they reanimated. She then attempts to kill a walker with her bow, but fails, and watches, stunned, as Andrea kills it by jumping over the wall and stabbing it with a knife. She scolds her for doing so, dismayed at her unusual behavior.



"
Made to Suffer
"
[
]


Haley found the injured 
guard
 inside a house after he was beaten by 
Rick
's group and she called for help. She was present at the meeting in 
Milton
's laboratory before the firefight between the Woodbury guards and Rick's group. Outside, she was ordered by The Governor to look for the attackers. After the attack, she goes to the clinic with 
Merle Dixon
 to see the wounded Governor. She is later seen at the Arena next to Milton and Andrea listening to The Governor's speech about the attack. It is unclear how she reacted towards the residents' calls for the death of the Dixon brothers.



"
The Suicide King
"
[
]


Shortly after Daryl and Merle start fighting, gunshots go off into the crowd courtesy of 
Maggie
. Haley is unable to react before Maggie shoots her in the chest, killing her instantly. When the townspeople flee in fear, Andrea kneels over her body, saddened that she was killed. Later, Philip names off the people that Rick's group had killed to Andrea, Haley being among them.



Death
