Trivia
[
]


Bob is present in the Spencer/Olivia death scene in "
Hearts Still Beating
", but is missing, along with two other extras, as soon as Olivia is killed.


Bob Miller did not appear in several episodes of Season 8 because Curtis Jackson did not film as frequently due to the nature of filming the background actors were partaking in, including running at night, crouching in sewer pipes for long periods of time, and hiking through various parts of the woods.

However, Bob Miller was confirmed to have been alive throughout Season 8 and safely evacuated from Alexandria to Hilltop before eventually returning home in "
Wrath
".


He is one of the few characters known to have died of natural causes.


Bob appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Variant
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Bob appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".

‚Üë
 
Curtis Jackson was the only core Alexandria extra not brought back for filming in Season 9, despite his availability and other core extras being asked back for filming. Due to his old age and the multiple time skips in the storyline for Season 9, it was concluded amongst the cast and crew that an elderly character such as Bob Miller would have eventually passed away due to natural causes/old age, hence the actor not being asked to return for filming.
