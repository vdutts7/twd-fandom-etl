Overview
[
]


Benjamin is a friendly, inquisitive, and eager young man. He dutifully serves his King and wishes to improve himself. Benjamin has supposedly read all of the books in the Kingdom's library and learned a great deal of practical knowledge from them. Although he initially lacks the ability to kill a walker in close combat, his skills improve under the tutelage of Morgan.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Benjamin's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he lived with his mother, father, and younger brother, 
Henry
. 



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At the onset of the apocalypse, Benjamin and Henry lost their mother, but their father survived. The three were eventually found by 
Ezekiel
 and taken to 
the Kingdom
 where they settled. However, Henry and Benjamin eventually lost their father too.

Benjamin was present at the time of the arrival of a notorious group of survivors named 
the Saviors
 who operated on behalf of 
Negan
. Upon meeting, the Saviors demanded a portion of supplies in exchange for leaving the community unscathed, to which Ezekiel complied under the condition that the Saviors would never step foot inside the Kingdom. 

Throughout the following months, Benjamin aided his group in gathering supplies in order to compensate the Saviors demands and thus he took part in several conducted weekly trades between the two groups, which he alongside Ezekiel, and several others kept secretly hidden from the rest of the community.

"
The Well
"


As 
Morgan
 shows 
Carol
 around the Kingdom, Benjamin gives Morgan a friendly wave as he leads his brother around on a horse in an enclosure. Later that day, he attends the feral pig hunt with Morgan, 
Ezekiel
, 
Dianne
, 
Richard
, 
Alvaro
, and 
Jerry
. When several walkers approach the area, Benjamin is prompted by Ezekiel to take out one as he was trained to, but is unsuccessful. With the walker threat neutralized, the group heads back to the Kingdom.

As per Ezekiel's request, Morgan begins to train Benjamin in aikido and takes him under his wing, to help train him to be a better fighter and survivor, especially as Ezekiel wants Benjamin in his court of advisers. After the training session in the gazebo, Benjamin notices a book in Morgan's bag and asks to read it, since he had read all of the available books in the Kingdom, including a manual to repair HVAC units. 

At dinner, Benjamin allows Henry to leave early for the movies but he stays behind with Morgan to chat, where he explains about his father and how he died when clearing a building of walker with other Kingdomers. Benjamin later attends the Savior food drop off, where his reaction to the Saviors and overall training are tested by Ezekiel. After the exchange, he heads home with his fellow soldiers.



"
Rock in the Road
"


When 
Rick Grimes
 and 
Paul Rovia
 try to convince Ezekiel to join the fight against the Saviors, Benjamin listens from the side as Rick gives a speech. Later that day, he is sent by Ezekiel to check on Carol in the woods while practicing his walker-fighting skills and tells her Ezekiel is going to continue checking on her because he cares about her. She gives him advice on staying quiet and tells him to go home before it gets dark. At the Kingdom, Benjamin looks on from the doorway as Ezekiel puts Henry down to sleep and then urges him to help Rick's group fight against the Saviors. Ezekiel thanks him for his counsel and says he is proud of him for going out alone.



"
New Best Friends
"


Benjamin is at the Saviors exchange with Ezekiel and the rest of his court, waiting for 
Gavin
 and his band of men to arrive. When 
Jared
 lunges at Richard, Morgan strikes him with his staff. Jared seizes the staff and hits Morgan with it, so Benjamin strikes Jared and sends him to the floor, before resisting. Upon returning to the Kingdom, Ezekiel warns Benjamin against being too eager to fight.



"
Bury Me Here
"


Benjamin quietly watches as Henry practices aikido with Morgan and smiles when his brother tells Morgan he wants to be like Benjamin when he grows up. He later exits from the gates with a group of Kingdommers to clear out a small group of walkers when Carol arrives, having beaten them to the task. When Carol finishes talking with Morgan, Benjamin approaches her, wanting to know more about how she is able to handle herself, but she brushes him off.

Benjamin then joins Ezekiel and his men on their routine supply drop. En-route to the drop-off location, they discover the road blockaded by a line of shopping carts and are all led to a dug-out grave. As Ezekiel laments on the nature of the current world and how lucky they are that they have not been driven mad by it, Benjamin asserts that it isn't luck, but rather it's because Ezekiel had managed to help them find peace in an apocalyptic outcome.

Upon arriving at the supply drop site, Gavin reprimands them for arriving late. After Jerry tells Gavin off for interrupting Ezekiel, he is struck by Jared, to whom Benjamin shows his extreme displeasure towards. As Gavin inspects the Kingdom's share of cantaloupes, he discovers that they are short of one. Their guns are seized and Gavin gives the order to Jared of killing Richard as retribution for not keeping to their deal.

However, Jared suddenly shifts his aim and fires, hitting Benjamin in the thigh and severing his femoral artery. After Gavin offers the Kingdomers one more chance, allowing them another day to supply drop in the final melon, the Saviors the Kingdommers to tend to Benjamin. As per Morgan's insistence, they drive Benjamin to Carol's house, figuring that he doesn't have long before he bleeds out. Despite the efforts of everyone present, Benjamin succumbs to blood loss and dies on the table. He is then stabbed in the head by Morgan to prevent his reanimation.

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Blake
.

Benjamin was described as "Early 20s. A scruffy, boyish, generally warm-hearted teenager who can be a bit of a wise-ass, but never a bully. He's caring and protective of others but isn't afraid to crack a joke if the situation calls for it. He's overcome loss, eager to take on more responsibility, and knows who he wants to be."


Benjamin read every book in 
the Kingdom
 twice.


Benjamin lived in the Kingdom for more than a year.


Benjamin is the first resident of the Kingdom to be killed on-screen.

While Benjamin was the first named Kingdom resident to die, his brother 
Henry
 was the last to die.


Considering "
Bury Me Here
" was originally scripted to be the fourteenth episode of 
Season 7
, then this would've continued the "trend" of a supporting character being introduced early in a season, only to be killed in the fourteenth episode of the same season.

This trend began in 
Season 4
 with 
Lizzie
 and 
Mika
, continued in 
Season 5
 with 
Noah
, and once again occurred in 
Season 6
 with 
Denise Cloyd
.


Benjamin is mentioned by 
Ezekiel
 to 
Michonne
 in "
Silence the Whisperers
" when referring to everything he's lost.


Benjamin's death is shown to have a lasting impact on Morgan, 
Henry
 and Ezekiel.

Both Morgan and Henry seek revenge for his murder, killing Jared and Gavin respectively for their roles in it.


Benjamin's death triggers Morgan's second descent into madness following the loss of a loved one that he only snaps out of when 
Jesus
 convinces Morgan to stop killing the living again in "
Wrath
".


In "
Faith
", Ezekiel refers to Benjamin as his family, alongside his brother Henry, and mentions that even a decade after his death, Ezekiel still hasn't forgotten Benjamin and how Negan and the 
Saviors
 caused his demise. As a result, Ezekiel has purposefully avoided interacting with 
Negan Smith
 in that time and only reluctantly works with him during the 
Outpost 22 Rebellion
. In "
Family
", Ezekiel has decided to let go of his bitterness and that Negan living to make something of his life is better.
