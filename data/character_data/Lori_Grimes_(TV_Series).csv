,,,"Lori was a strong, selfless, independent, and emotional woman, but was also shown to be difficult and demanding at times. Having believed her husband to be dead, that the world was coming to an end, and trying her best to keep herself and Carl safe, Lori became extremely vulnerable and lonely. During this time she began a relationship with Shane Walsh , her husband's partner in duty, something that would cause problems for her throughout the remainder of her life. With Rick's eventual return, she found herself filled with both extreme happiness and extreme guilt. She became torn between her husband and Shane; realizing they were both essential to her survival. However, her actions continuously put Rick and Shane at odds, significantly more so with the revelation of her pregnancy. Throughout season two, she strove to ensure that her unborn child would be healthy, and wondered whether the baby should even be born into such a horrible world. After the farm was overrun, she became deeply disturbed by Rick's actions, as well as Carl's involvement in the death of Shane. As the third season began, Rick started to shun her, something that pained her increasingly. However, Rick was devastated when he discovered that she died during childbirth. Lori showed herself to be a very selfless person when she faced her final moments of life, choosing baby Judith's life over her own, which she sacrificed with barely a second thought.","Lori lived and grew up in King County, Georgia.
