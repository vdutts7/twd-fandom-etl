Eugene Porter,Contents,Overview[],Pre-Apocalypse[],Post-Apocalypse[],Killed Victims[],Relationships[],Appearances[],Gallery[],Trivia[],References[]
,,"Eugene is aloof, eccentric, and highly intelligent. While a detriment to the group while on the road due to his cowardice and clumsiness, being neither ""combat ready or for that matter combat inclined,"" Eugene's value is evident in his ability to build helpful devices such as water filters and batteries out of common items. He's also extremely able to force locks. Due to some of his personality quirks, Eugene may have Asperger's Syndrome, a fact that producers have hinted at. He shows extremely poor social skills, poor coordination, peculiar habits of speech, and seems to have difficulty reading body language. He enjoys reading books and he is shown to be highly interested in video games. He sports a mullet, which he is very proud of. He is somewhat of a voyeur, who enjoys watching people having sex and eyeing up women. He very rarely smiles and speaks in a long winded, pedantic and clinical fashion. He has on occasion shown an ability in neologisms, evident when he saw a very unusual stuffed toy he took a liking to and named it a ""grimbly gunk"". He has a fondness for good food such as lobster, and also enjoys pickles.
Eugene prioritizes his survival over anything else, even allowing multiple people to sacrifice themselves to protect him under the false belief that he was an important scientist, although at the same time he was genuinely remorseful over this-he was always compassionate enough to care when others died and honestly showed regret over their sacrifices, but at the same time could not find the courage to put others before himself, something he was deeply ashamed of. After being kidnapped by the 
Saviors
, he uses the same lie in order to impress 
Negan
, and seemingly becomes one of his men in order to survive. Despite his manipulative abilities, he does possess a will to do good when he can, and as he continues to survive, he begins to put into perspective the importance of his conscience, going so far as to expose his lie for the well-being of his new friends.
Over the course of the second half of 
Season 5
 and the entirety of 
Season 6
, Eugene slowly begins to develop his skills as a survivor, and his courage, first when he saves 
Tara
's life after being injured by a grenade. While this is slow at first, it is only when the survivors fight back against the herd in 
Alexandria
 that he truly shows he has developed the courage and skills needed to survive. This evolution continues after the time jump, and he shows his courage and newfound skills to survive when he is taken hostage by 
Dwight
 and the Saviors, and gives the other survivors the opportunity to fight back. Eugene even offers to put his life in danger to distract the Saviors from Rick and the group while they attempted to take a sick Maggie to the 
Hilltop Colony
, showing how mature he'd become over the course of the series.
Eugene's newfound confidence, courage and selflessness however is severely retracted when he is captured along with his fellow survivors by the Saviors and is forced to witness the brutal executions of his close friends 
Abraham
 and 
Glenn
 within minutes of each other. Ever since that night, Eugene has reverted back to his cowardly state in order to continue surviving under Negan so he can never feel as afraid for his life as he did at that moment.
As the Sanctuary comes under siege, Eugene is shown to heavily question his decisions and his loyalties. As a result, Eugene has trouble sleeping and begins 
drinking
 heavily. Though Eugene discovers that Dwight has betrayed the Saviors, he chooses not to expose him, even after Dwight directly foils his plan to lead the walkers away. He is also conflicted with whether or not to help 
Gabriel
 escape with 
Harlan Carson
 to help Maggie and claims that the Survivors are now just his former traveling companions. Daryl and Tara leading the walker herd inside the Sanctuary appears to cause Eugene to let go of all ties to his former friends and to now state that anything he does will be for his own benefit. Despite this, Eugene still remains conflicted to the point that he aids Gabriel and Harlan in escaping to ease his conscience.
After being made the leader of his own outpost, Eugene begins to act more tyrannical and cruel, appearing to let his new power go to his head. He shows little care for Gabriel beyond keeping him from getting others sick (although this is most likely because he is angry about the death of Harlan, who was killed after Gabriel convinced Eugene to help them escape from the Sanctuary).
After an encounter with Rosita and the reminder of his betrayal of the only friends he ever had, Eugene has a change of heart and takes a stand by sabotaging the Savior weapons to allow the Militia to win. In doing so, Eugene acts selflessly as he would've been safe if he hadn't betrayed the Saviors and allowed them to slaughter his former friends. Eugene's act of bravery saves the lives of many people and earns him the forgiveness of the friends he had proclaimed to no longer care about. When discussing his choice with Rosita, Eugene makes it clear that it was her opinion of him and his actions that swayed him to do the right thing in the end. Years later, Eugene reveals that his time with the Saviors still haunts him, especially that he chose safety and order over doing the right thing. As such, Eugene holds himself as accountable for their actions as if he'd committed them himself.
Six years after Rick's supposed death, Eugene seems to have become a far braver, more competent, and more selfless individual, as he fearlessly took out several walkers, was willing to distract a large herd so that Rosita could get away, and encouraged Gabriel to stay with Rosita after she became pregnant with Siddiq's baby, despite his own feelings for her.
After moving to 
the Commonwealth
, Eugene fails to realize that 
Shira
 is just manipulating and using him until its spelled out to him after she disappears. However, Eugene is the first to deduce the existence of the Commonwealth's rogue element led by 
Lance Hornsby
 who seeks to undermine the government in order to gain power for himself. In doing so, Eugene proves himself to be an extremely good amateur detective, although no one takes him seriously about it and Lance shames and manipulates Eugene into keeping quiet about his discoveries in the end.
After falling in love with 
Max Mercer
, Eugene commits himself to her cause of taking down 
Pamela Milton
. After their actions causes 
Sebastian
's death, Eugene decides to take responsibility in order to protect Max rather than running. Although resigned to his likely execution, even acknowledging that someone like him should've been dead a long time ago, Eugene places his faith in his friends. Eugene's faith and determination helps to drive Yumiko to make a stand of her own rather than giving into hopelessness and many of the Commonwealth's people are shown to believe in Eugene and his innocence. Eugene's actions in the Commonwealth transform him from a former coward who lied to get the strong to protect him, into a leader in his own right who inspires others to stand up against a corrupt ruler, including some of her own men.","Eugene was born in 
Dallas, Texas
 in 1978 and grew up in Addison, Texas. His father is known to have been a mechanical engineer, which most likely inspired Eugene's knowledge and interest in mechanical engineering, among other scientific knowledge. He was likely diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which attributed to his personality quirks, obsessive knowledge, and rote memorization. At the age of six in 1984, Eugene and his family moved from Addison, Texas to Keller, Texas.
In his teenage years, he became deeply interested in trains and convinced his parents to take him to Strasburg, 
Pennsylvania
 in order to see the train museum there. While there he became hooked on ice cream from a local dairy bar. He also started the anti-drug and alcohol coalition in his high school. In mid-1996, when Eugene turned 18, he left Keller to attend an unknown university and graduated with his BA in 2000.
In his adult life, he lived in Dallas, Texas. He was an avid fan of video games. Being well read and possessing a vast amount of knowledge in many different areas, Eugene became an educator. In his adult life, Eugene showed great difficulty in social situations and never had a girlfriend.","Eugene somehow survived the onset of the outbreak, and eventually came across 
Abraham Ford
, who saved him from 
walkers
. Seeing the opportunity of being protected, he lied to Abraham, pretending he was a scientist who knows what caused the epidemic, and that he was on a mission to go to the capital, where supposedly he could reverse the effects of the plague and restore order to the world. During their journey they encountered fellow survivor 
Althea
, who interviewed them both before parting ways.
Eventually, they were joined by 
Rosita Espinosa
 and several other survivors, who traveled from Houston to northern Georgia, losing several members on the way.","This list shows the victims Eugene has killed:
