Overview
[
]


Ian is shown to be a ruthless leader. He is very untrusting to others due to his traumatic experience with past groups. He seems slightly unhinged and mentally unstable, as he keeps the skulls of his past enemies on a shelf and believes 
Aaron
's group to be cannibals. He seems to have a dark sense of humor, making many sarcastic quips as Aaron's group tries to recruit his 
community
. Even when being held at 
Toby
's mercy, he doesn't show any fear and merely laughs. Despite his questionable actions, he does seem to care about the safety of his people. Though hostile, he is not unreasonable and was willing to let Aaron's group go until Toby shoots him. 



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Ian's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Ian became the leader of a community called 
Riverbend
. 

Later, Ian and his community would have many encounters with hostile groups, causing him to become increasingly untrusting. At one point, a man named 
Billy Johnson
 arrived at the community and promised "great wealth and prosperity". However, this was a lie to get them out in the open to kill them all. Ian killed Billy for this and put him on a shelf with his collection of skulls.



Season 11
[
]


"
Warlords
"
[
]


Ian meets with 
Aaron
, 
Gabriel
, 
Carlson
, and 
Jesse
 and orders them to sit. Aaron describes the 
Commonwealth
 and invites Ian's group to join them. Ian shows them a collection of skulls from raiders who came to kill his group. He shoots his gun and orders them to kneel, worried they've come to eat his people. Aaron insists they aren't cannibals and offers to leave if Ian lets them go. Ian agrees, but Carlson grabs his gun and shoots him and kills his men. Carlson interrogates Ian and demands to know where the guns and cargo are located. Ian says he has no idea what Carlson is talking about. Carlson beats him up. Gabriel punches Carlson, prompting troopers to handcuff him. Carlson shoots Ian dead.

Quotes
[
]


The following is a list of some of Ian's most memorable quotes.





Season 11




"Soldiers? And churches, too, I take it. Eh, Father? Did you lose your collar? (…) Let's say this place is like the old world, and they do have a church. Then they have to have 
hookers
 too. Right? And gambling? Shit side of town where addicts swap needles with runaways. Got all that too?"
- Ian asking about the Commonwealth, "
Warlords
"





"You'd just let us in? That easy? (…) An audition! Well, let me get my tap-dancing shoes. 
(laughs)
"
- Ian asking how they'd be allowed into the Commonwealth, "
Warlords
"





"Where is this uh... Commonwealth located? 
("He can't tell you that")
 Why? Because 
you
 say so? "
- Ian asking where the Commonwealth is, "
Warlords
"





"Do me a favor, fellas. Turn around and look in that back corner. Those are raiders, murderers, rapists, and a few cannibals. All of them sat in the 
same seats
 you're sitting in right now. Most were wolves dressed as sheep. All of them meant my people harm. So, Mr. 
"Head Wolf"
, if you know where I live and I don't know where you live, 
how dumb
 would that be for me to let you go?"
- Ian to Aaron, Gabriel, Jesse and Toby about his shelf of skulls, "
Warlords
"





"What's your name? (…) Toby... Get on your 
goddamn knees!
 
Asses
 stay in the 
goddamn chairs!
 
GET ON YOUR GODDAMN KNEES!
 Answer the question. How dumb would I be to let you go, when you know where my home is? (…) Yes it would!"
- Ian as he holds Toby at gunpoint, "
Warlords
"





"You know... you remind me of ol' Billy Johnson. Billy came to us a few years ago, with promises of great wealth and prosperity in a land far away. But Billy wasn't gonna bring us to any promised land. Billy just wanted to get us out in the open, so his 
raiders
 could thoroughly kill us. Billy wound up on the shelf because he thought I was stupid. Do you think I'm stupid, too? 
Because I have plenty of room on the shelf right next to Billy!
 Tell me where your raiding party is or I'm gonna start dropping bodies on the floor, starting with 
him
!
"
- Ian to Toby about one of the skulls on his shelf, "
Warlords
"





"Wolves dressed as sheep, speaking lies. None of you seem to have any idea what my responsibilities are, to this place, and to my people. Has it occurred to any of you that they have entrusted me with their very 
souls!?
 Why did you come here!? 
WHAT DO YOU WANT!?
"
- Ian about being the leader of Riverbend, "
Warlords
"





"The meat. You want the 
meat!
"
- Ian to Gabriel about thinking they are cannibals, "
Warlords
"





"What a day. What a goddamn day. You will leave here. You will never come back and--."
- Ian allowing Aaron's group to go before being shot by Toby, "
Warlords
"





"What a day. What a goddamn day. You will leave here. You will never come back and--."
- Ian allowing Aaron's group to go before being shot by Toby, "
Warlords
"





"Hey, 
dickless
. If I found those weapons, don't you think I--."
- Ian's last words before being shot by Toby, "
Warlords
"
