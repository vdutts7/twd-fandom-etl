Overview
[
]


Roy is an aggressive, brutal, petty, and loyal 
Savior
. He has no qualms with murder, such as going along with beating a worker to death. Like many of his cohorts, he is extremely rude and condescending when dealing with the communities under the Saviors' control, such as his interaction with 
Enid
. He is extremely loyal to his leader, 
Negan
, to the point of being willing to die for him. After Sasha reanimates comes out of the coffin and tackles Negan, Roy saves his leader by getting 
Sasha
 off him, but is bitten in the process.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Roy's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Roy somehow came into contact with a group named the "
Saviors
" which he subsequently joined. 

Roy aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to 
Negan Smith
's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 7
[
]


"
The Cell
"
[
]


Roy is at the marketplace and steps in during a confrontation between a 
worker
 and a vendor. He and his fellow Saviors then proceed to beat the worker to death after he gets violent.



"
The Other Side
"
[
]


Roy accompanies 
Simon
 and numerous other Saviors to the 
Hilltop
 to get 
Dr. Harlan Carson
 since their own doctor, 
Emmett Carson
, was killed by Negan. Roy attempts to enter the cellar where 
Daryl
 and 
Maggie
 are hiding, but is distracted by 
Enid
 who asks him if he can take a bucket of vegetables to the Saviors’ truck. He refuses and demands that she does it herself, and proceeds to enter the cellar to take more supplies, but he fails to notice Daryl and Maggie and so leaves the cellar. He then leaves the Hilltop with his fellow Saviors.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"
[
]


Roy is among the Saviors traveling with Negan to 
Alexandria
. When they come across the fallen trees in the road, he uses a chainsaw to help remove the branches. Upon arriving at Alexandria, Roy pulls the undead 
Sasha
 from Negan after he opens the coffin, resulting in Sasha biting into his face, killing him.
