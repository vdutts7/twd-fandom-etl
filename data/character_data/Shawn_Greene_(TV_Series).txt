Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Greene Family Farm
[
]


Little is known about Shawn's life prior to or as the outbreak began. He likely moved onto the farm following Annette's marriage to Hershel. Shawn was just a newborn child when he moved to the 
Greene family farm
. His biological father is likely to have been out of the picture, since Shawn has his stepfather's last name. 



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Sometime after the initial outbreak, Shawn was killed by walkers. Before his initial reanimation, however, 
Hershel
 or 
Otis
 placed him inside of the barn, along with his mother, Annette.

"
Save the Last One
"
[

Maggie
 relates her sadness over Otis' death to her sadness over the deaths of Shawn and Annette. We later see pictures of him and Annette hung on the refrigerator in the farmhouse.



"
Secrets
"
[
]


Shawn and Annette are revealed by Hershel to be zombies in the barn. Maggie brought up his name, along with those of Annette and some of their neighbors, to 
Glenn Rhee
 when they were gathering supplies at 
Steve's Pharmacy
.



"
Pretty Much Dead Already
"
[
]


Toward the end of the episode, 
Shane Walsh
 opens the doors of the barn. As the 
zombies
 exit, the remaining Atlanta camp survivors proceed to kill all of them, Shawn included.



"
Nebraska
"
[
]


Shawn, along with his mother, 
Annette
, and 
Sophia Peletier
 are buried under the trees that can be found near the barn.

At the 
Manhattan Tribespeople
's base, Maggie looks through a box of old photos of her family, including Shawn.



Death

Killed By


Zombies
 
(Alive)


Shawn and his mother are both somehow bitten by walkers. Sometime later, he reanimates and is put in the barn.



Shane Walsh
, 
Andrea Harrison
, or 
Theodore Douglas
 
(Zombified)


After Shane forces the barn open, the walkers inside proceed to exit. Systematically, they are shot and killed by the group of Atlanta Survivors. 

It is unclear which survivor put down a zombified Shawn. However, due to the fact his head-shot was executed by one a single bullet from handguns rather than the scatter-rounds from the shotguns, it would have been either Shane, Andrea, or T-Dog.

Trivia

Kenneth Sutton
.


Shawn appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.
