Leah Shaw,Fate,Contents,Overview[],Pre-Apocalypse[],Post-Apocalypse[],Death[],Killed Victims[],Relationships[],Quotes[],Appearances[],Gallery[],Trivia[]
,,,"Leah is a stoic, hardened, but deeply traumatized woman. When she first meets Daryl , she is initially cautious and cold to him. Over the next few months she slowly begins to trust Daryl, eventually revealing the trauma and hardship she went through before the apocalypse, and also the loss of her adoptive son after it began. After some time, Leah and Daryl get romantically involved, however she becomes frustrated with Daryl constantly leaving to find his brother . She soon leaves the cabin and Daryl behind. It is later revealed she is a member of the Reapers and sees them as her family. When she sees Daryl again, she is initially unhappy with him, though he tries to tell her he never stopped looking for her. It becomes apparent that she still has some feelings for him and tries to convince to Pope that Daryl would be an asset to the Reapers. Leah's main defining trait is the bonds she makes with the people around her, whether be with Daryl or her fellow Reapers. She is very distraught by the death of Michael Turner , who she described as the ""little brother she never had."" She has also stated that she sees Pope as a father figure, and Pope himself has stated he trusts Leah more than the others. Leah doesn't seem to have a problem with her group slaughtering innocent survivors. When Daryl asks why the Reapers are hunting Maggie 's group even though they stole their home , she says it's so they don't try to come back for revenge and begins to defend the actions of Pope and her group. However, she still seems to retain some of her humanity, such as being unable to kill a man after being ordered by Pope to do so, allowing him to leave with his son, while also can't bring herself to put down a dying mother , prompting Daryl to do it for her. Overtime, Leah becomes more and more uneasy with Pope's leadership. When he lashes out at Washington and Ancheta , she defends them. She later states that his behavior has been unusual. She becomes angered at him when he begins to get some of the Reapers killed, such as burning Bossie and using Wells as bait to a horde of walkers. When Daryl reveals that he is part of Maggie's group, she feels hurt and betrayed. However, she goes along with his plan to take out Pope. When Pope orders Ancheta to fire the hwacha down at the courtyard, despite his men being in the line of fire, Leah kills him. However, she ultimately decides to remain with the Reapers to save what's left of her family rather than join Daryl. After she betrays Daryl, Leah becomes the leader of the Reapers. She shows her ruthlessness, and tries to make sure no one from Maggie's group makes it out alive. However, she still cares about the well-being of her family. She's greatly saddened at Austin 's death and is unwilling to leave without Brandon Carver . During the standoff, she threatens to have Jenson snipe Maggie unless Daryl releases Carver. However, when Gabriel kills Jenson and turns the tables, Leah is shown to be a coward, trying to go back to the original deal despite being willing to kill them moments earlier. At first, she and the remaining Reapers are allowed to leave, though without Carver. However, after being reminded about the promise she made to Elijah, Maggie kills Washington, Boone , and Carver. Daryl tracks Leah down but lets her go, leaving her as the sole survivor. Many months later, Leah is revealed to become a brutal, ruthless, and remorseless survivor with nothing left to lose. She is revealed to be the one to have stolen the Commonwealth 's missing weapons. She brutally slits one of the soldier's throats despite her begging for mercy. However, when Lance Hornsby gives her the opportunity to get revenge on Maggie, she accepts. When she finally captures Maggie in her old cabin, she is shown to become more sadistic, cruel, and cunning. Instead of merely killing Maggie, she tells her she wants her to suffer as much as she has. However, this allows Maggie to get free and the two engage in a fight. Though Leah bests her, she ends up being shot by Daryl, the man she used to love, dying in the cabin they used to live in.","Not much is known about Leah's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she grew up in a dysfunctional family. As an adult, she joined a branch of the U.S. military and was fighting in Afghanistan along with the rest of her squad which included a lot of members that would eventually become the Reapers . Upon returning from war, she struggled to find jobs or deal with trauma, but the relationship between her and her comrades remained strong, especially the one between her and Michael Turner . Leah then decided to become a mercenary. She also adopted her nephew named Matthew after his mother, her sister, died in childbirth. The two had a close relationship.","During the beginning of the outbreak, as Operation Cobalt was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the undead threat , Pope and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as ""the chosen ones"". It is unknown if Leah was present during this revelation. Regardless, she eventually joined the Reapers, and either found or crafted his own mask with a red design pattern and white stripe down the middle, and would use this mask as a scare tactic against those who were ""marked"" by Pope. Leah and her squad survived for a year together until one day their camp was overrun. Leah took Matthew and Dog's mother and fled the camp. She would later find out that Matthew had been bitten by a walker during the attack, and she eventually put him down before or after reanimation. The same day Matthew died, Dog was born.","Killed By Daryl Dixon After Leah knocks out Maggie and takes her to her old cabin , a fight breaks out between the two women with Leah eventually winning the upper hand. Daryl tracks them down and shoots Leah in the head before she can kill Maggie.",This list shows the victims Leah has killed: Matthew Shaw (Before Reanimation or Zombified) Ms. Adams (Possibly) Leo (Possibly) Teresa (Possibly) Pope Josephine (Zombified) Fisher (Accidental) Shipment Trooper (Alive) Marco Numerous counts of enemy combatants (Pre-Apocalypse) Possibly unnamed Meridian residents 3 unnamed Commonwealth soldiers (2 Alive) Numerous counts of zombies and unnamed people,"For a more in-depth look at Leah's relationships, read here; Leah Shaw (TV Series)/Relationships",The following is a list of some of Leah's most memorable quotes.,,"For more images of Leah Shaw, please visit Leah Shaw (TV Series)/Gallery .","Leah is the fourth and final major recurring secondary antagonist in the TV Series , with the first being Merle Dixon , the second being Simon , and the third being Beta .
