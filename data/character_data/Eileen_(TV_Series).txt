Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Eileen's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Season 3
[
]


"
Walk With Me
"
[
]


Eileen walks around town with groceries and waves hello to 
Rowan
, who is giving a tour to Michonne and Andrea. Later she crowds around the military vehicles that are brought into town by 
the Governor
 and his men.



"
Say the Word
"
[
]


Eileen is seen enjoying the barbecue, where she is sitting at a table in the streets with a girl who is getting her hair done. A man brings Eileen a drink. A short time later, Eileen is seen listening to the Governor's speech at the town barbecue. She is later seen standing in front of the bleachers, cheering at the gladiator fight between 
Merle Dixon
 and 
Martinez
.



"
Killer Within
"
[
]


One morning in Woodbury, Eileen takes a stroll in the street with several other residents as Michonne walks alongside the wall, casually inspecting the perimeter and the guards.



"
Hounded
"
[
]


Eileen, dressed in purple pants and a white shirt, is standing in the background while Andrea and the Governor are talking. She along with other women are sitting down chatting while they fold laundry.



"
Made to Suffer
"
[
]


After the first round of gunshots, Eileen heads out to the street to investigate and is encouraged by the Governor to return home and stay indoors. After Rick's group leaves Woodbury and the fight ended, Eileen is summoned to the arena for an announcement. When it is revealed that Merle and his 
brother
 were captured and deemed responsible for the night's attacks, she and the others jeer and demand death for both perpetrators.



"
The Suicide King
"
[
]


Eileen continues to jeer as Merle and Daryl are forced to fight each other to the death. When 
Rick
 and 
Maggie
 begin shooting and throwing smoke grenades in the arena, Eileen flees the arena along with the other townspeople. The next morning, she and the other townspeople try to leave Woodbury but are not allowed to do so. She then witnesses 
Richard Foster
 be attacked by a walker and killed by the Governor in the street. Shortly after, she listens to Andrea's speech.



"
Welcome to the Tombs
"
[
]


Following the failed 
prison assault
, Eileen's fate is unclear. However, she is most likely dead as it is likely she was among the Woodbury soldiers killed during the prison raid or massacred by the Governor out on the road as she was not seen with the remaining Woodburians arriving at the prison.

Trivia
[
]


The actress who portrayed Eileen revealed in an interview that she was given a wedding ring, indicating that her character was married, though it was never clarified as to who she was married, so the actress assumed Eileen's husband had died.

It is noteworthy to mention that 
Woodbury extra Jordan Rios
 has consistently appeared by Eileen's side throughout Season 3, suggesting some sort of relationship between Eileen and the man.


The actress revealed that she was not sure why she wasn't included in the Season 3 finale and also confirmed that she had not been called back for Season 4, indicating that Eileen was probably killed in the Governor's massacre.


Eileen is one of the thirteen characters in the 
TV universe
 to be pregnant during the events of the apocalypse. The others being 
Lori Grimes
, 
Maggie Rhee
, 
Ava
, 
Vida
, 
Michonne Grimes
, an unnamed 
Sanctuary Worker
, an unnamed 
Kingdommer
, 
Jane Carroll
, 
Rosita Espinosa
, 
Nabila
, 
Grace Mukherjee
, and 
Rachel
.
