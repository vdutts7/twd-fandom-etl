Overview
[
]


Although his personality is not well known, Bud appeared to be a particularly nasty, cruel and heartless person even by their standards in general. He was apparently the leader of a gang of bikers among the Saviors who ambushed and murdered innocent people on the road, a position of power he made it clear he enjoyed. Despite the fact that 
Daryl
, 
Abraham
, and 
Sasha
 had done no harm to the Saviors at the time when they encountered Bud and his gang, he seemed to take delight in making them feel powerless with his threats and taunts while he and his cohorts held them at gunpoint. His attitude towards killing people seemed to be extremely casual even by a Savior's general standards, as he stated with no remorse whatsoever that he and his gang generally "introduce ourselves by killing one of you right off the bat," although immediately after saying this he implied that this was only when a group of survivors did not seem to him like "reasonable people" as this was the reason he gave for initially sparing the lives of Daryl, Abraham, and Sasha. Despite this he changed his mind minutes later and decided he would kill them both after all just because Abraham disobeyed his order not to ask any more questions. Although he showed himself to be extremely witty, it was only in a smug, snarky, bullying way, such as when he tells Abraham not to "nibble shit" when he has to eat it.

Although Bud's motivation for his actions appears to be a belief that he was doing the right thing by his people, as was the case for most of the Saviors after being brainwashed by 
Negan Smith
, it appears that he was so unpleasant that even his fellow Saviors, even Negan himself, apparently disliked him. Neither 
Molly
 nor 
Paula
 showed any sorrow that he and his gang were dead, seeming to agree that they probably deserved it. Despite Bud's apparently high rank among the Saviors and loyalty to Negan, he posthumously labelled Bud and his gang "the dick brigade." All this implies that Bud was likely one of the most heartless, unsavory and depraved Saviors there were.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Bud's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At some point Bud eventually encountered 
Negan Smith
 to whom he then joined his group dubbed "The Saviors", upon where he became one of his lieutenants alongside 
Simon
, 
Wade
, 
Paula
, 
Gavin
, 
Regina
, 
Arat
, 
Jiro
, and eventually 
Dwight
.

He aided his leader into terrorizing other survivors and communities into subjugating to Negan's will, (including ambushing and murdering innocent survivors they encountered on the road). According to 
Molly
, him and his group enjoyed to demonstrate their superiority to other travelling survivors.



Season 6
[
]


"
Start to Finish
"
[
]


As 
Daryl Dixon
, 
Abraham Ford
, and 
Sasha Williams
 continue their drive back to 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 after briefly being separated the day before, they are stopped by Bud, 
Timmy
 and other armed men. He informs the trio that their truck, weapons, and all other supplies now belong to his leader, Negan.



"
No Way Out
"
[
]


Bud takes the trio's weapons and orders Timmy to make Daryl open the back of the truck. He informs Sasha and Abraham that his group of Saviors will be escorted back to wherever they call home and not to ask any questions. Abraham asks him who Negan is and he pulls a gun on Abraham. Sasha tries to reason with him and so he takes out another gun, now pointing at both of them. After a moment of holding the two at gunpoint in silence, he lowers the guns and says he won't kill either of them. However, he changes his mind after a moment and pulls the guns on them once again, though before he can kill either, he and his entire group are blown up with a rocket launcher by Daryl.

Quotes
[

The following is a list of some of Bud's most memorable quotes.



Season 6




"Why don't you come on out, join us in the road? That's great. It's going well right out of the gate. Now step two, hand over your weapons. (...) Well they're not yours. (...) Your property now belongs to 
Negan.
"
- Bud to Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham, "
Start to Finish
"





"See... your 
weapons
, your 
truck
, the 
fuel
 in your truck, if you got 
mints
 in your 
glove compartment
, you got 
porn
 underneath the seats, change in the seats -- hell, the 
seats
 themselves, the 
floor mats
, your 
maps
, little stash of emergency napkins you got there in the console... None of those things are yours anymore. (...) Your property now belongs to 
Negan.
"
- Bud threatening Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham, "
Start to Finish
"





"If you can get your hands on a tanker, your people our person wants to know. So let's get those sidearms 
shall we
?"
- Dean to Tara as he holds Jesus at gunpoint, "
No Way Out
"





"If you have to 
eat shit
, best not to nibble. Bite, chew, swallow, repeat. 
Goes quicker
."
- Bud to Abraham as he refuses to cooperate, "
No Way Out
"





"I get the curiosity, but we have questions ourselves, and we'll be the ones asking them, while we drive you back to wherever it is you call home. Take a gander where you hand your hats. First though... your 
shit
. What have you got for us? (...) Come on, I mean can we not? Okay? There's more. There is always 
more
."
- Bud asking Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham to hand over everything, "
No Way Out
"





"Bite, chew, swallow, repeat. (...) 
Ding-dong, hell's bells!
 You see usually we introduce ourselves by just 
popping
 one of you right off the bat, but you seem like reasonable people. You're sportin' dress blues for Christ's sake! And like I said we're gonna drive you back to where you were, and you know how awkward it is carpooling with someone whose friends you've just killed? But I told you not to ask any questions and then what does this 
ginger
 do? So that's that. I don't want you to get the wrong impression of me."
- Bud after Abraham asks who's Negan, "
No Way Out
"





"I'm not gonna kill you... Wait, wait... you know what? 
Yes I am.
"
- Bud's last words as he's about to shoot Sasha and Abraham, "
No Way Out
"

Trivia
[
]


Bud is credited as 
Biker
 in "
No Way Out
".


While the character is not specifically named, his actor 
Christopher Berry
 personally named him 
Bud
.
[1]


It appears that Bud was unpopular among his fellow Saviors. 
Molly
 labels him and his gang "idiots" who used to "put on a show" and she and 
Paula
 seemed to agree that they probably deserved what happened to them, and 
Negan
 calls him and his gang "the dick brigade". This implies that they were foolish and particularly unpleasant people, even by the standards of the Saviors in general.


He was the first character to mention Negan's name in the show.
