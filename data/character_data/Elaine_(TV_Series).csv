,,Nothing is known about Elaine's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point during the outbreak, Elaine joined a 
community
 in Ohio and became an ice cream clerk at the community.
Elaine makes an appearance in the Commonwealth's orientation video as she is shown giving children ice cream from her truck.
Elaine is working in the ice cream truck parked in the town square, getting two ice cream cones ready for ""Stephanie"" and Eugene when suddenly 
Max
 walks up, prompting Elaine to excuse herself as she retrieves a tray of ice cream cones for Pamela Milton and hands it to Stephanie, remarking on a new flavor she included in the order. She then resumes taking care of ""Stephanie"" and Eugene's order.
Elaine briefly appears in a flashback as she distributes ice cream from her truck.
With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by 
Colonel Vickers
 and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Elaine's fate is left unknown. It is possible she was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.","This list shows the victims Elaine has killed:
