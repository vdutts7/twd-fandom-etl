Overview
[
]


Justin is brutish and lazy, often slacking off on his duties with little regard for how it might affect others. He is also shown to be greedy and a bully, shoving Henry to the ground when the boy tried to stop him drinking more than his fair share of water. He is described by Rick as a trouble maker that always blames other people for his actions.

It is also revealed that Justin, while under Simon's leadership, was a cruel killer, as he is revealed to have murdered Beatrice's husband following the failed rebellion initiated by the Oceanside group. This action, however, would eventually cost Justin his life.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Justin's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Justin somehow came into contact with a group called "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined. 

Justin aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered. 

At some unknown point later, Justin was among the Saviors that executed every male survivor above the age of 10 from the 
Oceanside
 community under 
Simon
's orders. He personally killed 
Beatrice
's husband.



Season 9
[
]


"
A New Beginning
"
[
]


During the year and a half that passed since the end of the 
war
, Justin was forced to work on the 
Sanctuary
 under 
Daryl
's orders. When several crows invade the crops, he and 
Arat
 try to use a 
walker
 as a scarecrow, like the Saviors used to do, but Daryl puts it down. Later that day, 
Rick
 and his 
group
 arrive to deliver supplies later that day when 
Michonne
 points out graffiti over the walls that proclaims 
"We are still Negan."
 Daryl orders Justin to clean it up, to his annoyance.



"
The Bridge
"
[
]


Having moved from the Sanctuary to the work camp along with several other residents, Justin is part of the team of laborers working to build a bridge connecting the communities' trade routes. One morning, 
Henry
 arrives at the bridge to give water to the workers when Justin shoves him down for not giving him extra water and starts drinking from the jug. Henry gets angry and knocks him down with his stick. 
Jed
 sees this and mocks Justin, before helping him get up.

Before a furious Justin can retaliate, Daryl stops him, saying that the kid's just doing his job. They soon start fighting until Rick arrives and stops them, forcing everyone to return to work. When a herd of walkers approaches the construction site later that day, Justin forgets to sound off his alarm to divert the herd, which causes 
Aaron
 to lose his arm. Despite explaining to 
Carol
 that his radio wasn't charged, Daryl attacks Justin and punches him repeatedly with a saucepan.

That night, a stitched up Justin talks to Rick and tells him he needs to keep his "dog" on a leash, in reference to Daryl. Rick approaches and tells him he knows his type, the one that likes to blame others for his problems. Rick tells Justin to takes his things and leave and if he sees him again, a couple of stitches won't fix what he would do to him. Justin retorts that he wouldn't stay if Rick begged him to and says he will not wait until morning to leave.

While walking in the woods, Justin drinks the last of his hooch when he hears something rustling in the bushes. He takes out a machete, then lowers it as he recognizes the person approaching when suddenly he gets violently pulled aside and is taken to 
the former community
 of the Oceansiders where Beatrice executes him, finally avenging her husband's death.



"
Warning Signs
"
[
]


Justin's corpse is left on a field where he is fed upon by several walkers before they are drawn off by a nearby noise. Justin reanimates moments later and wanders off. The next morning, a zombified Justin is found by 
Maggie Rhee
 and 
Kal
 on their way to the Sanctuary and is put down. His body is brought to the camp, causing tension between the various communities. At night, 
Beatrice
 confesses to Daryl and Maggie that she killed Justin as he had murdered her husband.
