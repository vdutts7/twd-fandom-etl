No, we don't know how many are there. Just relax.... We don't want any trouble. We're just looking for our friends. If something happened, tell us. This place is crawling with corpses. If you can help us not get killed, I'd appreciate it.

Overview
[
]


Nate is shown to be a violent, hostile, and dangerous individual. When he, 
Sean
, and 
Randall
 encounter 
Rick
, 
Hershel
 and 
Glenn
, Nate asks them if they know where 
Dave
 and 
Tony
 are. After finding out they were killed, Nate wants to get revenge on Rick's group, while Sean and Randall just want to leave. Though Rick tries to reason with them, Nate shoots at them and a gunfight ensues. Nate is even shown to be willing to leave his own group members behind, such as when Randall who injures himself, Nate drives off, though he is apologetic for this action. Ironically, Nate, who was the person who wanted a fight, was the only member of his group to make it out alive.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Nate's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At some point following the outbreak Nate joined a large group of survivors known as the 
Living
.



Season 2
[
]


"
Triggerfinger
"
[
]


Nate is the third member of the group that came searching for Dave and Tony in the town. He, along with 
Randall
 and 
Sean
, began firing at 
Rick Grimes
, 
Glenn Rhee
, and 
Hershel Greene
 when they discovered that Rick's group had killed Dave and Tony. During the stand-off, the sound of the firearms lured the walkers towards 
the bar
. Realizing the town was becoming overrun with more and more Walkers, he decided to get the vehicle and prepared to escape. Finding Sean bitten and being devoured by the walkers, he drove the truck up to 
Steve's Pharmacy
 to allow Randall to jump down. When Randall missed, Nate didn't want to take any more chances and left, driving out of the town alone. His fate is still currently unknown since he drove off, although it can be assumed that he returned to his camp and informed the group about the deaths of 
Tony
, 
Dave
, Sean, and most likely Randall.

Trivia
[
]


Nate is the only named member of the 
Living
 with an unknown status.


Nate, 
Maggie Rhee
, and 
Michonne Grimes
 are the only characters introduced in 
Season 2
 to not die in the 
TV Series
.


It's possible Nate's last name is Miller, as 
The Walking Dead Universe Roleplaying Game
 has a member of the Living named Nate Miller, who is also said to be the leader. Though, it's possible they are separate characters.
