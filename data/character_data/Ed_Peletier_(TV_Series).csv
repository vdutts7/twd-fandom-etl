,,,"Ed was a boorish, surly, combustible, abrasive, compassionless, misogynistic and vicious bully who was brazenly violent and abusive to his wife and implied to be violent to his daughter as well -- as while threatening to kill him in response to him hitting Carol, Shane also mentioned that if he put his hands on Sophia again, he'd kill him for that as well. At one point Ed started an argument with the women of the camp that was completely unprovoked and brazenly threatened to hit Andrea; he would also often verbally abuse and harass the other women of the group. Carol reveals that the controlling bully would try and assert his dominance by not allowing her to wear attractive clothing. In ""
Omega
,"" Carol's adopted son 
Henry
 tells 
Daryl Dixon
 that he overheard Carol telling 
Ezekiel
 that whenever she tried to get away from Ed, he would use her long hair to pull Carol back to him and abuse her more. Carol subsequently kept her hair short to prevent this and the trauma of Ed's abuse would cause her to keep her hair short for years after his death before she would feel safe enough to let it grow long again.
Ed was revealed to have paid very little attention to his daughter Sophia and when she was an infant he would often stay at a friend's house, leaving Carol to care for Sophia. While never elaborated on, it's hinted that Ed had a predatory sexual relationship with his daughter as Carol stated in a prayer in ""
What Lies Ahead
"" that she wished Ed to be punished for not only abusing her but also ""for looking at his own daughter, whatever sickness was growing in his soul."" 
Lori Grimes
, who was sitting beside Carol during the prayer, reacted noticeably.","Ed never attended college and grew up as an uneducated and abusive individual. In his younger years, he charmed Carol enough to convince her to date and eventually marry him. They had a daughter together, who was named Sophia. He rarely paid attention to Sophia, often relying on Carol to be the parental figure of the family. When Sophia was an infant, Ed resorted to staying at a friend's house nights on end, leaving Carol to deal with Sophia by herself.
Ed dominated Carol throughout their marriage, from preventing her from buying her own clothes, to physically and verbally assaulting her in order to solidify his authority. At one point, Ed grabbed Carol by her hair and slammed her head against the wall, an event which would cause her to cut off all of her hair.","During the onset of the outbreak, Ed and his family traveled towards a supposedly safe-zone in Atlanta. On the way, they got caught in a traffic jam and met 
Shane
, 
Lori
, and 
Carl.
 While on the road, Ed became angry when Carol offered a snack to Lori so 
her son
 could eat, and ordered her not to share with anyone. Sometime after the city was napalmed by the military, they formed a campsite outside the outskirts of Atlanta, along with other survivors.","Killed By
Zombies
 
(Alive)
As Ed is sleeping, he hears something outside his tent. He assumes that its someone bothering him and opens the tent, only to discover a walker. It manages to force itself inside Ed's tent, biting him on the neck before being joined by other walkers who devour him.

Following the attack, as the remaining survivors clean up the camp, Daryl is about to put down Ed's corpse but Carol comes over and decides to do it instead using a

Vatos
"", it was implied that Ed may have a history of sexual abuse towards 
Sophia
. This is never explored however, as his death followed almost immediately.

This is further supported by 
Carol
's words in ""

"", after Sophia's disappearance. In the 
church
, Carol said praying for Ed's death was a sin, even though he looked at his own daughter ""with whatever sickness was growing in his soul"".
