Overview
[
]


Tim is a loyal soldier to the 
Governor
 and follows any order he is given. He helps carry out ruthless acts, such as aiding in gunning down the National Guard. Later, while tracking down 
Michonne
, he shows no fear, in contrast to 
Gargulio
, and even finds humor in Michonne's "biter gram." However, he'd ultimately meet a brutal end moments later, after Michonne comes out and impales him with her sword. Tim is then accidentally shot twice by Merle, killing him.

"
Walk With Me
"
[
]


Tim resided in Woodbury. He accompanied 
the Governor
 on a mission to a helicopter crash scene, where he stood guard, armed with a silenced 
Walther P38
 pistol, as the others dispatched walkers, and took one US soldier prisoner. He accompanied the Governor on an ambush of a National Guard group, assisting in taking out the soldiers and recovering their weapons. After a surviving soldier was seen limping away from the carnage, the Governor shot him in the side and handed Tim a knife, ordering him to put an end to the soldier's life.



"
Say the Word
"
[
]


Tim was first seen at the Woodbury celebration. He was walking with some buddies when Michonne turned and ran into him, causing him to call out. Then he saw Michonne find out who killed the zombie arena. Tim is later seen in a truck with 
Martinez
, Milton Mamet and Merle Dixon. They searched for zombies to use for the Woodbury arena event. Tim managed to trap some of the zombies and they transported them back to Woodbury. He is not seen again until nightfall during the arena fight between Merle and Martinez. It appeared that Tim was the referee of the arena fights, allowing the walkers to move closer and blowing the whistle at certain times.



"
Hounded
"
[
]


Tim, Merle, 
Crowley
, and 
Gargulio
 were sent out to search for Michonne. However, their target ambushed them, and Crowley was decapitated. Tim was then impaled by her sword before being used as a shield for Merle's bullets. A few moments later, Merle walks over to Tim's corpse and stabs his head before he could reanimate.
