 as they address the crowd. Later, Barbara is with 
Bruce
, 
Anna
, Kent, and several other angry Alexandrians complaining about their rations. She tells 
Olivia
 she is barely able to make two meals out of what she is given, to which Olivia suggests she add water to her soups. After Anna and Kent also complain, Bruce decides to lead the crowd on a raid of the pantry. Barbara packs a box with food when 
Spencer
 orders the mob to stop and put the food back, and reminds them they are a community and must work together if they want to survive. Barbara and the others sheepishly return food to the shelves before departing from the pantry. Later that afternoon, Barbara witnesses 
Betsy
 as a walker in her home, prompting her to scream in horror. As neighbors run over to witness the situation, Barbara, along with Tobin, Olivia, Anna, Bruce, and

Trivia
[
]


Barbara is credited as 
Mother #1
 in 
Season 5
.

This character was given the name 
Barbara
 in "
Now
".


The character's name and appearance is a reference to the character of Barbara in 
Night of the Living Dead
.
[1]


Barbara was credited in "
Start to Finish
", "
The Next World
", and "
Wrath
" but did not appear in the episodes.


Mandi Christine Kerr was far along her pregnancy while filming "
Service
" that she was only featured in the church scene as they were able to use a headshot instead of featuring her entire body and showing the baby bump.


Oddly, Barbara does not appear to be upset regarding the apparent deaths of her children in the Saviors' grenade attack on Alexandria in her appearances following "
How It's Gotta Be
".

However, it is possible that her feelings on the matter weren't portrayed in-depth, as she is a minor character.


In a 
promotional photo
 for "
Home Sweet Home
", the actress' cell phone can be seen in Barbara's back pocket.


Barbara appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".


Mandi Christine Kerr has confirmed that Barbara was not killed off and believes she survived the 
Commonwealth Conflict
, despite not appearing since "
No Other Way
".
[2]


Barbara was meant to appear in a third episode in Season 11, but due to continuity errors, the scenes were reshot and she was no longer included.
[3]


Barbara, 
Gabriel Stokes
, and 
Aaron
 are the only named characters introduced in 
Season 5
 to not die in the 
TV Series
.


Barbara is currently the longest-living named recurring character in the TV Series.


Barbara has the highest season count of any named recurring character, appearing in at least one episode each in seven consecutive seasons from Seasons 5 to 11.
