,,,"Todd is a somewhat sarcastic and incompetent individual. He often doesn't think before speaking, such as talking back to Mara before trying to apologize. This prompts Mara to send him inside and do a different chore. After Rick 's group attacks the outpost, Todd ends up being the only survivor. He doesn't seem to be combat proficient, as he attempts to ambush Rick and Daryl but misses despite having snuck on them. Rick gives Todd his word that they'll spare him if he answers their questions, which he accepts. While answers he does genuinely seem cooperative. However, despite Rick giving him his word, Daryl shoots Todd anyway.",Nothing is known about Todd's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, Todd somehow came into contact with a group named ""the Saviors"" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as a worker for one of the outposts. Todd aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered. Todd is working on the courtyard of the Savior outpost when Mara tells him to quicken his pace. After he talks back and realizes the error of his ways, he is dismissed and ordered to perform another chore inside the outpost as Huck takes over his duty at the maintenance station. When the militia arrives and starts a battle against the Saviors, Todd remains hidden safely as his companions fight against the Alexandrians. Having survived the battle, Todd ambushes Rick and Daryl from behind a tree. Realizing that Todd is alone, Rick offers to let Todd live if he will surrender and tell them what they want to know. After Rick gives his word, Todd surrenders and asks what they want to know. When he is questioned about the presence of heavy weapons, Todd tells the two that they were there but were moved to Gavin 's outpost the day before. Afterwards, instead of releasing Todd, Daryl shoots him in the head, killing him, much to Rick's shock.","Killed By Himself (Indirectly Caused) Daryl Dixon After the battle at the Savior outpost he was working at is over, Todd fires a shot at Rick and Daryl, causing them to take cover behind a truck. Rick gives Todd his word that if Todd surrenders and tells them what they want to know, he will let him live. However, after Todd complies, Daryl immediately shoots him in the head.",This list shows the victims Todd has killed: Himself (Indirectly Caused) Possibly numerous counts of zombies and unnamed people,,""" The Damned "" "" Monsters """
