No, it's completely sane. For the first time in the long time. I'm not ending up like

Jacqui
 
(pronounced jack-E)
 is a survivor of the outbreak in 
AMC
's 
The Walking Dead
. As a member of the Atlanta 
camp
, she helps out with the chores and participates in supply runs.

During the beginning of the outbreak, Jacqui assisted the group by any necessary means.

Overview
[
]


Jacqui is a cautious woman with little words who shows compassion and sympathy for her friends. Although the world has fallen apart and many people have lost most, Jacqui remains calm and looks at the best of every situation, regardless of its flaws. She likes doing what is best for the group of survivors, and is not hesitant to make sure no threats are present, especially when she comes to the realization that 
Jim
 has been bit by a walker. 

During her time with the survivors, Jacqui is shown to be very resourceful, smart and helpful, helping to assist the group escape the department store by telling them the building might have access to the sewers in their basement. Although it didn’t work out as planned, Jacqui was still able to assist the survivors in a helpful way. 

Jacqui is ultimately also a brave woman, who ends up committing suicide during the CDC explosion, taking a lesser-painful way out, rather than being bit later on. In her last moments, she comforts 
Jenner
 as they hold hands and she smiles with tears in her eyes. 



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


Nothing is known about Jacqui's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she looked after her brothers when their mother died and she worked for the city's zoning department.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the onset of the outbreak, Jacqui escaped from Atlanta as her entire family was devoured by walkers. Sometime later, she encountered and joined a campsite of survivors outside the outskirts of the city. She helped out the group by going out on supply runs and performing simple chores around camp. Jacqui also appeared to have developed a bond with T-Dog.

"
Guts
"


Inside the department store, Jacqui watches as Andrea points a gun in Rick's face as he and Glenn enter. 
"We're dead because of you,"
 Andrea tells him, furious at his recklessness. Morales informs Rick that his gunshots have attracted numerous hordes of walkers. 
"You just rang the dinner bell,"
 Andrea seethes, as the group's attention turns to a crowd of walkers outside that are slamming themselves against the outer set of glass-pane doors, furiously trying to gain entry.

Jacqui and the group questions Rick about what he was doing roaming around the streets of Atlanta aimlessly. He tries to explain he was trying to flag down a helicopter. Jacqui suggests that it was just a hallucination. 
"I saw it,"
 Rick insists forcefully.  T-Dog tries to make radio contact with the camp, but fails to get a signal, wondering if they might have better luck on higher ground. Suddenly, muffled gunshots are heard. 
"Oh god, is that Dixon?"
 Andrea says in disbelief, as they all leave to investigate.

On the roof, Jacqui and the group find Merle firing at walkers with a rifle. T-Dog chastises him for wasting bullets and attracting more walkers. Merle scoffs at him and calls him a racial slur, which sets off a fight between the two. Jacqui screams as Merle beats T-Dog and presses a handgun to his forehead. Rick intervenes, hitting Merle with the butt of the rifle and handcuffing him to a pipe. 

Morales informs Rick there's no refugee center and that they are part of a larger group of survivors staying outside the city, but T-Dog can't reach them on the radio. 
"We're on our own,"
 Rick says. With the streets no longer safe, Rick suggests they try to escape underground. Jacqui says that the building might have access to the sewers, prompting Andrea and the group to head back downstairs to the basement. In the basement, Glenn concocts and sends Jacqui to stand atop the ladder to warn of danger while he and Morales head down the sewer.

Later, Jacqui, Morales, and Glenn arrive with the others to report that the sewer is not an option. Jacqui and the group heads to the roof. On the roof, Rick spots a cube van at a nearby construction site. The group discusses the difficulty of moving past the walkers undetected. 
"They smell dead. We don't. It's pretty distinct,"
 Andrea says. Rick latches onto the concept of scent and how the dead use it to differentiate between themselves and the living. A while later, Morales and Rick collect a dead walker from the alley. Inside, Rick acknowledges the walker's lost humanity and then begins hacking the dead body to pieces with an axe. Jacqui then helps smear the guts on them.

Jacqui, Morales, Andrea, and T-Dog race to the roof to follow Rick and Glenn with a pair of binoculars as T-Dog tries again to radio the others. Suddenly, Jacqui and the rest watch as rain begins to fall rather heavily and washes the guts' smell off of them. Rick and Glenn fight the walkers and manage to get inside the cube van. On the roof, Jacqui and the group worries that they're being left behind but celebrate as Rick drives back for them.

Jacqui and the group grab their bags and rushes from the rooftop toward the loading dock, with no concern for unlocking Merle's handcuffs. They manage to get inside the van as the walkers break into the store. Rick drives away from the city as the group catches their breath. They look around at one another and a guilt-ridden T-Dog admits to the others he dropped the key, leaving Merle trapped on the roof, still handcuffed to a pipe.



"
Tell It to the Frogs
"


While 
Carl Grimes
 and 
Sophia Peletier
 are playing, they encounter a 
zombie
 eating a deer and scream, and Jacqui escorts them away as the men take care of the situation. Later, she is present for the tense conversation between Rick and 
Daryl Dixon
, and is seen gutting squirrels as they leave for Atlanta for Merle and guns. 

While doing laundry at the quarry with Andrea, her sister 
Amy Harrison
, and 
Carol Peletier
, she and the women share what they miss most, hers being her coffee maker. When Carol's husband 
Ed
 comes around and begins snapping at the women, telling Carol it was time to go, she shouts at him that they know he beats her. After Ed smacks Carol, she watched in shock as 
Shane Walsh
 begins punching Ed senseless.



"
Vatos
"


When Andrea and Amy return with fish they had caught, Jacqui smiles and hi-fives Andrea in triumph. Jacqui joins in with the conversation about 
Dale Horvath
's watch, she says "unless I've misread the signs, the world seems to have come to an end. At least hit a speed bump for a good long while", as she is enjoying a fish feast at night with her fellow campers. The zombies attack, prompting her to flee with the others to the RV, where she is seen in the background armed with an axe, leading Carol and Sophia to Lori, Carl, and Shane, then she backed up Dale who was shooting with his rifle. She survives the attack while others are not so lucky.



"
Wildfire
"


As Jacqui helps in the cleanup of zombie corpses the morning after the attack, she notices blood on 
Jim
's shirt, and demands he lifts up his shirt, but he rejects and is forced to show, revealing a bite wound. She screams out that he's been injured. She later attends the funeral for the fallen survivors and cares for Jim in the RV. She hugs goodbye 
Miranda Morales
 and her family as they announce that they are parting ways. When on the road, she cares for Jim but when the RV breaks down, she is forced to say goodbye to Jim as they leave him outside a tree on the road, since he is feeling worse. She can be seen collecting herself on the RV steps as the others say goodbye to Jim. She reaches the 
Center for Disease Control
 and is about to flee with the other survivors until the doors suddenly open.



"
TS-19
"


Jacqui and the rest of her group are admitted into the CDC by Dr. 
Edwin Jenner
 after going through a blood test to ensure none of them are infected. She is introduced to the luxuries the facility has to offer, including hot water and real beds. She enjoys dinner and wine with everyone and learns about TS-19 and Dr. Jenner's work, and the fall of the CDC's infrastructure. After Dr. Jenner reveals the purpose of the countdown timer and shuts the control room's door, tears run down her face, but she manages to remain calm, while others aren't able to control themselves as well. 

As the survivors finally get Edwin to open the door for their escape, T-Dog grabs onto her arm, trying to pull her outside the room with him, but she pulls herself back, telling him she's staying. T-Dog tells her "That's INSANE!", attempting to pull her out with him a second time, but she once again resists, saying "No, it's completely sane, for the first time in a long time. I'm not ending up like Jim and Amy." This catches the attention of the rest of the group, as they all look back at her. Jacqui then tells T-Dog "There's no time to argue, and no point -- not if you want to get out. Just get out...get out!" she protests, then pushing T-Dog, but right after she touches T-Dog's face in a kind, motherly manner. Shane then pulls T-Dog out with the rest of the group, and Dale approaches Jacqui with a shocked look on his face. She backs away from Dale, shaking her head no, and then walks to the back of the room. She's then seen witnessing Dale pleading with Andrea to leave with him. As the rest of the group (who have managed to escape the building) are getting in their vehicles, the scene of Dale and Andrea escaping is shown on a monitor, revealing that Jacqui had ultimately decided to stay behind with Jenner, as Dale got Andrea to change her mind. Jenner says "They got out," to which Jacqui responds with a smile, happy that the people who helped her make it so far are able to continue fighting. She looks at Jenner, as they then hold onto each other's hands as the timer ticks down, and the CDC explodes. She died at peace, rather than some of her previous allies whose deaths were painful results of the walkers.

Hounded

Rick begins receiving phone calls from individuals who he believes are part of another group. A woman calls Rick asking why he wouldn't reveal how Lori died to the 
previous man
 he spoke to on the phone. She calls Rick by his name, and when he questions how she knows his name, the woman says because she knows him, then hangs up the phone. Rick then receives a phone call from Lori, who informs him that the people he had spoken to previously were Amy, Jim, and Jacqui, revealing that all of the calls did not actually take place in the real world, but were merely hallucinations in Rick's mind.
