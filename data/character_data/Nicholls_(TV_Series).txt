Overview
[
]


Even among fellow 
Reapers
, Nicholls is shown to be particularly eccentric and delusional. He is one of the most religious Reapers, praying to God after he is badly wounded by one of 
Daryl
's arrows. When 
Gabriel
 finds him, Nicholls has a somewhat friendly and jovial attitude towards him despite being on opposite sides, though Gabriel doesn't buy any of it. Nicholls' behavior when talking with Gabriel is quite strange, saying he is 
"blessed"
 despite dying from his wounds. When Gabriel confronts Nicholls about attacking his friends, Nicholls states that his friends tried to kill him despite the Reapers being the ones who attacked first. Despite his immense faith in God, he has no qualms committing violent crimes of stealing and murder of innocent survivors. Nicholls asks Gabriel to pray for him, believing that even enemies deserve that much. However, Gabriel tells him 
"God isn't here anymore,"
 before stabbing Nicholls in the head.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Afghanistan
[
]


Prior to the outbreak, Nicholls was fighting in Afghanistan along with the rest of his squad which included a lot of members that would eventually become the 
Reapers
. Upon returning from war, he struggled to find jobs or deal with trauma, but the relationship between him and his comrades remained strong. He then decided to become a mercenary.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the beginning of the outbreak, as 
Operation Cobalt
 was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the 
undead threat
, 
Pope
 and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as "the chosen ones". It is unknown if Nicholls was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers, and either found or crafted his own mask with a pale faced, wide-mouthed design, and would use this mask as a scare tactic against those who were "marked" by Pope.



Tennessee
[
]


At some point, Nicholls and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by 
Maggie Rhee
 despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group.



Season 11
[
]


"
Acheron: Part II
"
[
]


Nicholls is among the Reapers who ambush Maggie's group on the road leading to Meridian. They kill Roy and severely injure Cole, prompting Maggie's group to scatter into the woods, with Nicholls and the other Reapers going after them.



"
Hunted
"
[
]


Nicholls and his fellow Reapers attack the members of Maggie's group, managing to kill Cole and injuring several others. During the attack, Nicholls non-fatally slices 
Gabriel Stokes
 on the neck. At one point, Nicholls is shot in the neck by Daryl, prompting him to run away. The injured Reaper eventually discards his mask and limps through the woods. He is found by Gabriel, who survived the Reaper ambush. Gabriel follows him and finds him laying on a fallen tree while praying. Nicholls asks Gabriel to pray for him. Nicholls says, 
"I thought you were a man of God?"
 to which Gabriel replies, 
"God isn't here anymore,"
 before stabbing him in the head.



"
Rendition
"
[
]


While trying to get 
Pope
 to recruit 
Daryl
 into 
the Reapers
, 
Leah
 mentions that Nicholls is still missing, showing that the Reapers don't know what happened to him.

Trivia
[
]


In the Memoriam on 
Talking Dead
 for "
Hunted
", he is credited as 
Pray for Me Reaper
.


Nicholls shares many similarities with 
Nelson
, a soldier of the 
Commonwealth Army
. Both men are mortally wounded and ask 
Gabriel
 to pray for them before their deaths. However, while Nicholls is seemingly delusional about his actions and how he tried to kill Gabriel's friends, Nelson shows genuine remorse and helps Gabriel and his group by giving them information about where their friends are.

Both of them were also soldiers, though while Nelson became a soldier in the post-apocalypse, Nicholls was a soldier in the pre-apocalypse.


Before being confronted by Gabriel, Nicholls recites Psalm 23:4 to himself: "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me."
