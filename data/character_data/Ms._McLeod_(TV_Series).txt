Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about¬†Ms. McLeod's¬†life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she suffered from arthritis.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Season 3
[
]


"
Made to Suffer
"
[
]


Mrs. McLeod is among those woken up by the gunshots and explosions throughout town. After Rick's group leaves Woodbury and the fight ended, Mrs. McLeod is summoned to the arena for an announcement. When it is revealed that Merle and his 
brother
 were captured and deemed responsible for the night's attacks, she and the others jeer and demand death for both perpetrators.



"
The Suicide King
"
[
]


Ms. McLeod continues to jeer as Merle and Daryl are forced to fight each other to the death. When 
Rick
 and 
Maggie
 begin shooting and throwing smoke grenades in the arena, Ms. McLeod flees the arena along with the other townspeople.



"
I Ain't a Judas
"
[
]


Ms. McLeod is seen walking around town with other residents while 
Karen
 argues with 
Martinez
 about 
Noah
 being drafted into the army. A short time later, Ms. McLeod gathers with other Woodburians as 
Milton
 introduces her to the 
Governor
 as the one with arthritis. The Governor takes a look at Ms. McLeod and while holding her hands, he promises that they find will another way for her to serve so she does not need to be a fighter.



"
Welcome to the Tombs
"
[
]


Ms. McLeod congregates near the main gate with several other adults and children staying behind in Woodbury as the militia prepares to raid the prison. Later that day, she is seen inside a building with 
Mrs. Richards
 and several others as they sit around and chat. The next morning, Ms. McLeod is among the remaining Woodburians to be evacuated and welcomed to the 
prison
 and invited to join the community.



Season 4
[
]


Post-Prison Attack
[
]


After the Governor and his army attack the prison, Ms. McLeod's fate is unknown after the majority of the survivors evacuate on the bus. If she did not die during the time-skip between Seasons 3 and 4, or from the flu prior to the attack, Ms. McLeod was killed during the prison attack.

Death
[

Philip Blake
 
(Possibly, Caused)


The Governor's Militia
 
(Possibly, Caused or Direct)

If she had survived up until this point, then she either died in the Governor's attack or was devoured by the reanimated residents on the bus.

Trivia
[
]


Despite a thread on 
The Walking Dead
 fansite Spoil the Dead, reportedly confirming that Lucie O'Ferrall was asked by producers to appear in Season 4 with the other Woodbury extras, she was not seen in any of the episodes. It was later reported that Lucie O'Ferrall was not on set for any filming, as the actress became unavailable for filming after her husband suddenly passed away.
