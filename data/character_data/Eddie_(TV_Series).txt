“


He's 
starving!
 He's slowing, he needs something 
alive!
 Please, 
I
 can't be without him and so I kept him. It was 
wrong.
 I can't do things like this! Yeah I have to do things like this! Let me be like him! Don't stop it! Don't 
end
 it after! Let me be with him.
 


―Clara to 
Rick Grimes
 about why she didn't put Eddie down before she kills herself.

Atlanta, Georgia

Almost nothing is known about Eddie's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was from Ireland. He was in the Atlanta airport terminal with his wife 
Clara
 during the early stages of the global outbreak. There, he and Clara were waiting to catch a flight to Puerto Vallarta for their honeymoon when their flight was cancelled. They were held in the terminal until 
zombies
 most likely broke in the terminal.

Eddie is found as a

 to Eddie's reanimated head, but she failed and later committed suicide asking Rick to let her reanimate and be like her husband.
