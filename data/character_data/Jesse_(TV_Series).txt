Overview
[
]


Jesse is a helpful and jovial young man. According to 
Aaron
, he is training to become a recruiter for the 
Commonwealth
. On the mission to 
Riverbend
, he is shown to be enthusiastic to help. However, he becomes quite scared when they enter the building. He becomes more shocked when he realizes 
Toby
's true motives that he was assigned by Lance to wipe out the complex, instead of recruiting them, believing they are responsible for an attack on a Commonwealth caravan. Due to this, he attempts to flee instead of going through with Toby's plans, getting shot under Toby's orders, but manages to get away. In his last moments, he arrives at Hilltop and manages to warn the group about the Commonwealth.

Jesse joins with 
Toby
, 
Aaron
 and 
Gabriel
 to take point on an outreach mission with a community in an apartment complex to offer them membership with the Commonwealth. The group's leader, 
Ian
, meets with Aaron, Gabriel, Carlson, and Jesse and believes them to be enemies. Though Aaron and Gabriel talk Ian into letting them leave with their lives, Toby attacks and kills him and many of his people. Realizing his true intentions, Jesse attempts to flee on horseback. Toby orders a trooper to kill him, firing a shot at Jesse's back. Aaron cuts the soldier down with a swing of his 
mace arm
, as Jesse escapes.

Prior to getting shot, Jesse flees the complex to unhitch his horse. He is encountered by 
Negan
 when he emerges from the woods with a comrade named 
Annie
 and realizes Aaron and Gabriel are at the complex. Negan gives Jesse a map to 
Hilltop
 and asks him to tell Maggie that Gabriel and Aaron are in trouble. Eventually, Jesse approaches Hilltop on horseback, then falls off his horse. He gives 
Lydia
 a map and says that a slaughter is taking place before dying. His message ultimately leads Maggie, 
Elijah
 and Lydia to Riverbend to help their friends and the surviving residents.
