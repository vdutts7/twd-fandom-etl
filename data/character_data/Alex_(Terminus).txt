Overview
[
]


Alex outwardly puts on an approachable and friendly appearance. When the group arrives at 
Terminus
, he is the one to show them around. However, 
Rick
 immediately realizes something is off and holds Alex at gunpoint. It's eventually revealed that Alex and the rest of his group are all cannibals. Through flashbacks, it's revealed that Alex was once a good person and that Terminus was genuinely supposed to be a sanctuary until they were attacked by a 
rapist group
. Alex is shown to regret this choice, questioning why they put up the signs.

Strangely, 
Gareth
 gives little reaction to Alex's death, suggesting they weren't all that close. It's even revealed that after his death, they were going to use Alex's body as food. The only real reaction that Gareth gives is to list his brother amongst those that he blames Rick and his group for killing.

"
[

Alex appears in Terminus and shows 
Rick Grimes
' group around. He starts to give the group food, handing a plate of meat to Rick's son Carl and Michonne. Before he can give any to Rick, he is grabbed and held at gunpoint after Rick becomes suspicious about the clothes the residents are wearing, which appear to be the clothes of Rick's group mates. He tries to reason with Rick and the others to let him go, but is accidentally shot by a Terminus resident shortly after.



Season 5

"
No Sanctuary
"
[
]


Alex appears in a flashback, shook up by the events currently taking place. Locked in a box cart with 
Gareth
 and a few other Terminus residents, Alex says that they should've never put the signs up, and that they brought the attackers onto themselves. After Gareth says that they were trying to do the right thing, as they were human beings, with Alex replying, "what are we now?"

Alex's corpse is also seen in the slaughterhouse of Terminus. His corpse was in the process of being dissected by two Terminus butchers. After an explosion caused by 
Carol Peletier
, Rick breaks himself free and kills both the two Terminus butchers. Before he goes to free everyone else, Rick pauses and notices Alex's corpse on the butcher table.

Trivia
[
]


Alex is the last character to die in 
Season 4
.

He is also the first named member of 
Terminus
 to die on-screen.


In "
A
" Alex refers to Mary by her name instead of calling her mom. This might be to avoid letting any newcomers know of their relationship as it could be used against them.
