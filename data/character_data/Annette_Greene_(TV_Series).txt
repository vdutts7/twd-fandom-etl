Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Greene Family Farm
, 
Georgia
[
]


In the early 1990s, Annette and her son, Shawn, moved onto the 
Greene Family Farm
 when she and 
Hershel Greene
 married. They both presumably helped work on the farm along with the rest of the Greene family. Shortly after their marriage, she became pregnant with their daughter, Beth.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Sometime after the initial outbreak, Annette was killed by 
walkers
 along with her son 
Shawn
. Before their initial reanimation, however, 
Hershel
 placed them both inside of the barn to roam freely.

"

Maggie relates her sadness for the death of 
Otis
 to her sadness for the deaths of Annette and Shawn. She points to pictures of each of them that are hung on the refrigerator.



"
Pretty Much Dead Already
"
[
]


Maggie
 brings up Annette in a conversation with her father, reminding Hershel of her anger and depression years back when he married Annette and moved her into their house. Towards the end of the episode, 
Shane Walsh
 unlocks the doors of the barn. One of the walkers that stumbles out is Annette.



"
Nebraska
"
[
]


Annette's body is seen among the other dead walkers. A distraught 
Beth
 hovers over her mother's corpse unaware that she hadn't been killed. She attacks Beth, and as the group gets the girl free from her grasp, 
Andrea Harrison
 impales Annette through the head with a 
scythe
, finally putting her down. Later on, she is buried with her son, Shawn, and 
Sophia Peletier
 under some trees by the barn.

Andrea Harrison

During Shane's rampage of opening the barn, a zombified Annette comes out of the barn and is shot in the cheek by Daryl with his shotgun. 

After shooting everyone in the barn, Beth runs up to her mother's corpse not realizing that she wasn't fully killed. Her zombified mother attacks Beth as she tries to get away before Annette is impaled through the head with a 
scythe
 by Andrea.
