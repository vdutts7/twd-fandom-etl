Overview
[
]


Edward is shown to be a brutal, cunning, cruel, and ruthless man. He is a remorseless killer, who goes along with robbing and murdering other survivors, such as helping hold a 
man
 for 
Owen
 to slit his throat. However, despite his brutal nature, Edward is shown to not be the most combat-proficient, losing every fight he was in. He attempts to sneak attack 
Morgan
 while Owen distracts him, but misses, and the two eventually get subdued. Later, Edward surrounds Morgan again, this time with four other Wolves and they still aren't able to kill him. Finally, he attempts to kill 
Rick
 in an RV but misses all of his shots which costs him his life.

Strangely, during the attack on Alexandria, after Morgan tells them to flee since the 
Alexandrians
 have guns and they don't, Edward takes his advice and retreats with the others. This is quite strange behavior, as the Wolves are usually shown to be relentless and bloodthirsty when killing others. Before leaving, Edward tells Morgan that the Wolves didn't choose their way of life, suggesting they possibly resorted to killing others out of desperation.

Edward first appears when the 
leader
 of his gang gives him a signal to kill 
Morgan Jones
 from behind using his blade. He misses Morgan and gets knocked out after the two brawl. He is later put inside of a car. It is not shown how Edward and Owen get out from the car, but they eventually stumble upon the 
Red Poncho Man
 whom 
Daryl Dixon
 and 
Aaron
, two recruiters for the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
, were following earlier before they lost him. They bring the man to their headquarters and slit his throat. They soon discover Aaron's bag, along with the photos of Alexandria inside it, which leads Edward and his people to their next target - Alexandria itself.

Edward and his group attack Alexandria. During the attack, he recognizes Morgan and he and four of his companions surround him and attempt to kill him. Morgan manages to fend them off with his quarterstaff and tells them that there are guns in the safe zone and that they will all be killed if they stay. Morgan also tells them if they choose to continue living this life, they will die. He then tell the Wolves to leave and never come back. Edward tells Morgan that him and his group didn't choose this life and he and his companions flee the Safe Zone. Before leaving, Edward steals a gun from a slain survivor.
