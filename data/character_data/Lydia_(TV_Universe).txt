Overview
[
]


Lydia is a cunning and hardened, yet deeply traumatized young woman, suffering from years of physical and psychological abuse inflicted on her by her mother, Alpha. While initially being fully devoted to the Whisperer way, and only acting as a scared little girl, her time at the Hilltop reawakened memories of her childhood. While she initially believed her father was abusive and her mother caring, these memories were the product of years of gaslighting from Alpha. The truth was quite the opposite, as Lydia finally realized during her brief captivity. Lydia also believed her mother's physical abuse was done out of love and was necessary to strengthen her. Her time with Henry made her resent the Whisperer lifestyle, and she expressed a desire to stay at the Hilltop. Nonetheless, Lydia selflessly chose to go back to her mother and the Whisperers in order to save Alden and Luke, that were being kept hostage by Alpha. When Henry came after her and was captured, Lydia punched him in anger, though this was most likely an act. Later, she is unable to kill Henry when her mother commands her to, and chooses to run away with Henry when Daryl and Connie come to rescue him.

When Alpha kills Henry and 9 other fair attendees, Lydia becomes depressed and even suicidal, and is shown to feel tremendous guilt over the event, particularly as she was in love with Henry as she revealed in "
Silence the Whisperers
". Once Carol refuses to kill her and encourages her to live, Lydia regains some of her old self back, and even participates in a snowball fight at Alexandria.

Once away from her mother, Lydia displayed a greatly caring and gentle personality, though she was unwilling to suffer abuse or be used as a pawn by those around her. While initially appearing to be something of a coward, surrendering without a fight in her first encounter to Daryl and the others, she has displayed a great deal of courage and determination over time, bravely risking her own life to defend the Hilltop even though she knew her mother wanted her back. However, this can work against her in some situations such as when she fought back against her bullies with kindness and only succeeded in enraging them more in the attempt.

Unlike some survivors of the zombie apocalypse, Lydia does not like violence and killing, a trait she shared with Henry. To this extent, Henry promised before going into a fight that he wouldn't kill anyone, but Lydia forgave him when he was forced to in self-defense, recognizing the necessity of it despite her hatred for all of the killing. Notably, when Lydia did begin training in combat, she chose to utilize Henry's 
staff
 as a weapon rather than the more lethal spears, knives or bows of the Coalition. Along with potentially being an act of sentimentality since the staff belonged to her boyfriend before his murder, utilizing the staff gave Lydia the ability to non-lethally take out a human opponent and avoid killing if faced with such a situation while still being a lethally effective weapon against walkers and humans if need be.

After falling in love with 
Elijah
, Lydia becomes afraid of acting upon her feelings due to her fears of losing someone that she loves again, even pulling away from Elijah to keep herself from getting hurt. After 
Aaron
 gives her advice based upon his 
own relationship
, Lydia opens herself up to love again, although she reassures Carol that she will never stop loving Henry. Upon being separated from Elijah by a herd, Lydia is desperate to get to him, even after losing her arm, and despairs that she may have lost someone else she loves when Elijah doesn't show up at the Commonwealth.

A year after 
Pamela Milton
's defeat, Lydia is still happily with Elijah, has adjusted well to her missing arm and enjoys the peaceful life that she's finally gotten the chance to experience.

Lydia was born in 2004 and grew up in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States where she was raised by her abusive mother 
Alpha
 alongside her loving father 
Frank
 who would sing "Lydia the Tattooed Lady" whenever she was scared whilst she affectionately rubbed his father's tattoo of her name to comfort her. She was also affectionately nicknamed "bug" by her parents. 

At the age of 3, Lydia found herself trapped within a closet tangled up in dry-cleaning plastic after Alpha had previously turned her back on her. Lydia began to suffocate as her mother sadistically watched until she collapsed. Alpha removed the plastic from her face and asked if Lydia was okay, only to hit her daughter hard so she would never do it again.

Baltimore, Maryland

Lydia, along with her parents, Alpha and Frank, survived the initial stages of the outbreak together. After 23 days of the initial outbreak, she remained in a moldy basement with a group of survivors. Lydia used to be naive regarding the status of the world and always spent time with her dad due to her mother's abusive nature.

After 43 days, the undead began to overrun the outside of the building. A fellow survivor, 
Matias
, started to have a panic attack and wanted to leave the basement. Alpha, knowing noise could draw them in, smothered Matias to death, believing that he was too weak to survive this world and was a threat to her family. In order to spare Lydia from the horror, Frank distracted her with her lullaby. Later that night, unknown to the group about the virus infecting the living, a reanimated Matias began to attack the group. Alpha then attempted to lead her family to safety by escaping, but Frank tried to save their friends, which resulted in Alpha murdering him.

According to Lydia, she and her mother watched many survivor communities thrive and then eventually fall, eventually evolving her mother into a more hardened survivor willing to resort to whatever measures necessary to survive. In the years that followed, Alpha would tell Lydia the reverse of events in the beginning, that Frank was the abusive one and she was the one trying to protect Lydia, that Matias killed her father and not Alpha herself.

For the next couple of years, Lydia and Alpha survived on their own by walking among the walkers using their blood to blend in. At some point, they were forced to seek shelter in an abandoned hospital and encountered a 
lone man
 wearing a mask. He reluctantly allowed them to stay one night but forbade them from entering his private quarters. Lydia trespassed on his side of the hospital forcing Alpha to follow her and ended up killing the man's zombified best friend to his fury. Alpha calmed him down and welcomed him to join them, also convincing him to skin his friend's face off, and wear it to continue hiding his identity (to which she and Lydia learned).

At some point following this, the three eventually formed a large group of survivors that would eventually become known as the "
Whisperers
", with Alpha being the group's leader and Beta as her second-in-command. Under their direction, they instructed their people to skin the walkers and wear their skin in order to mask their scents and move freely among herds in order to attack other survivor camps and settlements. The group members were also demanded to abandon their previous lives and beliefs and become nothing but hardened, primitive survivors. Lydia would suffer from her mother's abusive methods of survival during the next years in order to become stronger.

Adaptation
"


On a bridge, Lydia and some Whisperers are cornered by 
Daryl
, who uses his crossbow to see who are Whisperers. He hits one in the leg and a man falls down screaming in pain, attracting walkers to him. Lydia and the other try slowly escaping to the other side, where 
Michonne
 is waiting for them. They draw their knives and attack, but Michonne and the rest kill them with ease as Lydia gets on her knees to surrender. Daryl rips off her mask as Lydia begs for her life. Michonne angrily questions her but when more walkers show up Daryl decides to take her with them.

Later, the group arrives at 
Hilltop
 with a captive Lydia and 
Jesus
' body, causing the whole community to react in disbelief. In the cellar, Daryl throws her in a cell as Michonne rips off her blindfold and tells her 
"No more bullshit!"


Daryl, Michonne, and 
Tara
 interrogate Lydia, who claims to not have a name and that her group consisted of good people who were just trying to survive. Michonne asks if her people know about Hilltop but she begs to be left alone.

A while later, Daryl rushes back to the jail to demand Lydia to reveal her identity. 
Henry
 tries to intervene but Daryl shuts him down. He slams her against the bars and asks if she comes from a place with walls. She tells him that places like Hilltop never last and her 
mom
 told her they needed the dead to stay safe. He raises his knife to her and demands why her people killed his and she says they were always going to. She tells him her mother is out there alone but he calls her a liar before dragging her towards the exit. Lydia begs for her life and he lets her cower back in her cell.

Daryl then reminds Henry of his place and warns he'll stay in his cell until he realizes it. After he leaves, Lydia thanks Henry for saving her and introduces herself. Outside, next to a window, Daryl listens in.



"
Omega
"


In Hilltop, Lydia tells Henry how she survived at the start of the apocalypse with her parents in a shelter. Henry tells Lydia about 
Carol
, who would do anything to protect him. He asks more about her parents and Lydia says her mother is also relentless and is not someone anyone would want to mess with. Outside, Daryl is sitting by the window and listening to their conversation.

Later, Henry offers Lydia an egg. She tells him to keep it and that hunger is a gift. She asks why he's being nice to her and he says that he, his brother, and his dad were messed up when they were first found out there and it took a lot of someone being nice to make things okay again. Lydia says her dad said that things will never be okay again and tells him how her mom used to distract her with board games. Henry tells Lydia her mom seems nice and reveals he and his adoptive parents are from another community called The Kingdom, which is a day's ride from Hilltop. Suddenly, Daryl storms downstairs and takes Henry out of his cell. 

Later, Daryl goes to Lydia's cell and offers her medicine to help with her ear, but she refuses. He tells her that Luke and Alden are missing, but she says she knows nothing about it. He then asks her if her mom would kill their people if she crossed them. Lydia says that she would if she had to and tells him how her mother had to kill a man who was panicking and scared. Daryl says to Lydia that her mom did what she had to keep her alive. Lydia again pulls at her ear and Daryl tosses her the medicine, reminding her the people at Hilltop will help her if she helps them. She asks him for water and when he gets close she tries grabbing him. He grabs her arm and pulls up her sleeve, revealing a series of cut marks, causing her to retreat in the corner. Daryl looks at her for a moment and then leaves.

At night, Daryl visits Lydia again to find out more about her bruises. She says she got them from her mom, so Daryl asks why she won't tell her where she is. He says she’s safer here than out there but she disagrees and says her mother’s abuse makes her hard. Daryl calls it bullshit, but Lydia says staying soft makes you die and tells him that her father was weak and died saving her. Lydia then tells him that he is strong and doesn't belong in Hilltop. Daryl says she doesn't know shit about him and leaves.

A while later, Henry frees Lydia from the cell so they can hang out outside. Lydia immediately grabs a worm from the ground and eats it. She gives one to Henry, who does the same. Henry shows her around as she sneaks a hammer behind her back. She nearly bashes him with it until she hears a baby crying, which triggers more memories from the shelter. She then asks Henry to take her back to her cell. He agrees as Daryl watches them from nearby. In the cell, Lydia asks Henry to stay with her. They hold hands through the bars and fall asleep.

In the morning, Daryl finds them holding hands. Lydia asks for the pills, promising not to attack this time. She confesses she was trying to get intel from them and that if her mom did find Luke and Alden then they're probably dead. She then explains her people are always on the move and that her memories were mixed up because her mother lied to her. Lydia confesses her father was caring and her mother was the monster. She then finishes her story by claiming her mother killed her father. Lydia cries and apologizes to Daryl for wasting his time, but he says she didn’t and goes outside.

Bounty

In the woods, Lydia is hidden by Henry in a cabin and changes into cleaner clothes, claiming it feels weird. Suddenly, 
Enid
 and 
Addy
 show up to demand Lydia back for 
Alden
 and 
Luke
, but Henry refuses to give her up. Enid tells him about watching her parents die and how Carl told her she has to live for more than survival. Henry's torn so Lydia offers to give herself up to save their friends. She kisses Henry and they return to Hilltop.

At Hilltop, Daryl hands Lydia over to Alpha in exchange for Alden and Luke, who are embraced by Enid and 
Magna's group
. Lydia apologizes to her mother and Alpha smacks her across the face, ordering her to address her as Alpha like everyone else. She then smiles at Daryl as they leave.  



"
Guardians
"


In the woods, Alpha questions Lydia about her time at Hilltop. She talks about their farmland, supplies, and weapons, but leaves out their dealings with other communities like the Kingdom. Alpha's disappointed over her lack of intel so Lydia asks if that’' the only reason she came for her. 
"What a stupid question,"
 Alpha says.

A while later, Lydia and the Whisperers stop in the woods to rest. Unknown to her, Henry watches them from a close distance. Suddenly, 
Beta
 grabs Henry from behind and tosses him in front of Alpha. He says he's been tracking Henry for a while, but Henry's been tracking them for longer. Alpha questions him as Beta threatens to break his arm. Henry relents and reveals he came alone to get Lydia. She calls him stupid and punches him in the face. Alpha decides Henry's coming with them.

In the woods, Alpha asks Lydia why she didn't mention Henry but she says he wasn't worth mentioning. Alpha reminds her that he just risked his life to save her, so she must be lying. They arrive at the 
Whisperers' camp
, which is full of people without their walker masks. Alpha instructs Beta to tie Henry to a tree and to get Lydia a new mask.

Later, Lydia watches in silence as Alpha executes a couple of Whisperers who challenged her for leadership. Then, she shows Henry she still has the necklace he gave her, signaling she secretly supports him.

At night, Beta takes Henry to Alpha. She makes Lydia pick up a knife and tells her to kill Henry with it to prove what side she's on. Lydia begins to cry as she approaches Henry. Alpha warns her not to be weak like her father and that if she doesn't kill him, Beta will kill them both. Suddenly, a small herd of walkers show up and begin eating the unmasked Whisperers. Alpha and the others quickly put on their masks to try to lure the herd away as Daryl and 
Connie
 arrive disguised as Whisperers to rescue Henry. They grab Henry, who grabs Lydia, and together they escape.



"
Chokepoint
"


In the woods, following their daring escape from the Whisperers, Daryl blames Lydia for getting them into this mess and says she can't go with them back to Hilltop. Connie and Henry refuse to leave her behind and run off with her in another direction. Daryl reluctantly follows them.

At dawn, Daryl and Connie devise a plan to use an office building as a means of separating the Whisperers from the undead. Lydia warns Daryl that Alpha's going to send Beta, who's their best fighter. 
"We'll kill him first"
, Daryl promises. Inside the office building, Henry gifts Lydia a spear he made and she reminds him she's not willing to kill her own people. He takes it back and tells her he'll try not to either. Lydia then scolds him for risking his life for her, claiming that what he did made Alpha look weak. He reminds her he cares about her and they kiss. Daryl interrupts and tells them to keep watch.

Later, Lydia spots a group of walkers/Whisperers emerge from the bushes. In the middle of the group is Beta, who quietly instructs his people to spread out as Daryl shoots one of them with his crossbow. Beta and his people break in and quickly discover a trap meant to separate them from the dead. Meanwhile, Daryl makes Lydia hide in a closet with 
Dog
 as the Whisperers creep upstairs. 

As the fight rages, a Whisperer attacks Henry and stabs him in the leg. Unable to stand leaving Henry in danger, Lydia breaks down the closet door with a crowbar, releasing Dog to go to Henry's rescue. With Dog's help, Henry kills the attacking Whisperer and is then tended to by Lydia. Though Henry apologizes for having to kill one of her people, Lydia reassures him that it's alright and continues to tending to Henry's wound as the fight ends.

Afterward, Connie draws the herd away with her slingshot and Daryl tells the others they're headed to 
Alexandria
 to get Henry help because it's closer. However, he doesn't intend to stay as the Whisperers will never stop hunting them and they will instead keep moving on.



"
Scars
"


Lydia arrives at Alexandria with Daryl, Henry, and Connie. From a guard post, Michonne tells Daryl she's skeptical of Lydia but he assures her she's on their side. Inside, Lydia watches as Henry gets his leg stitched by one of the town doctors.

Later, Lydia sits on a porch when Michonne asks for a moment alone with her and tells her she's done things that she's not proud of. She suggests that Lydia would make Alexandria a lot safer if she just walked away. At night, Lydia, Daryl, Henry, and Connie leave for the Kingdom.

The next day, Lydia, Daryl, Henry, and Connie encounter Michonne and 
Judith
 in the woods and join them on their way towards the Kingdom.



"
The Calm Before
"


Lydia and the group arrive at the 
Kingdom
 as the fair starts. She watches as Henry reunites and is warmly greeted by his family and how the group treats each other with kindness. Suddenly, Tara spots her among the group. 
"The plan was to bring Henry…just Henry"
 Tara says angrily to Daryl.

Inside the theater, Lydia listens as the leaders reunite and decide to grant her asylum in Alexandria, send some soldiers to Hilltop to guard against any potential attacks from the Whisperers and to re-establish the charter. She then sees as they all sign the charter.

In the fair, Lydia walks with Henry and marvels at how everyone is close to each other in the community, when Carol and 
Ezekiel
 find them and they are invited to go to the movies at night. 

Later, Lydia sits by a table as Henry talks nearby with Addy. Suddenly, 
Gage
 and 
Rodney
 introduce themselves to her and tell her that Addy has a thing for Henry, making her uncomfortable. However, she proceeds to throw goat feces at them as payback. Henry then sits with her and assures her he likes her. They kiss and he leaves to check on the pipes, asking her to save him a seat at the movies.

At night, Lydia waits for Henry to show up when Alpha sits down next to her and quietly tells her not to say anything. Outside, Alpha confronts her about being a traitor but she tells her this is a better way of life. She then threatens to scream if she doesn't leave and Alpha disowns her, telling her she was never one of them. Lydia breaks down in tears as Alpha leaves. 

After a while, Lydia runs up back to the movie theater and tells Ezekiel that her mother was at the fair and she can't find Henry, leaving him speechless.

The next day, in the Kingdom, Lydia listens from the crowd as 
Siddiq
 delivers the tragic news, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen.

Sometime later, Lydia and Daryl return to the border. Lydia leaves the necklace Henry made for her on the ground by the pike that once held his head and as the two walk away, snow flurries begin to fall.



"
The Storm
"


Several months after the fair massacre, Lydia has become a daughter like figure to Daryl, being protected and cared by him. In the Kingdom, as everyone gets ready to leave and move to Hilltop, Lydia is given dinner by Daryl.

On the road, the group spots walkers in a field but keep moving undetected. Suddenly, Alden asks Lydia if they're her people. 
"We followed their rules, haven't they done enough to us?"
 but is shut up by Daryl. Lydia tells him, 
“I don't want to cause any more problems,"
 but Daryl reminds her people should stop blaming her.

Later, after Daryl kills a walker and leaves the group to retrieve his bolt, Lydia wanders alone into the forest. She finds a walker trapped in ice and takes off her glove while crying. She offers her hand to the walker to kill herself, but stops when Carol appears and follows her back to the group. As more snow starts falling, Michonne decides to take the group to the 
Sanctuary
. In the Sanctuary, Lydia sits by herself and watches as Daryl walks around. After a while, the group gets ready and leave the Sanctuary.  

In the woods, the group passes the pikes into Alpha's territory. Michonne kills frozen walkers, unsure if they're Whisperers or not, before reaching the frozen lake. Lydia leaves the group and heads again into the forest. Carol tracks her down to a cabin and demands to know what she's doing. Lydia explains she can't cross the river because going to Hilltop won't fix anything because everyone will still blame her for what happened. 
"Your son's dead because of me,"
 she says, before asking Carol to kill her. Lydia holds Carol's spear to her own neck and tells her this is how she ensures they don't lose anyone else. Carol considers doing it but stops herself and kills a walker instead. 
"You're not weak,"
 Carol says before taking her back to the group again.

In the morning, Lydia and the group finally arrive at Hilltop, where Daryl knocks off the head of a frozen walker. That night, Lydia watches in awe at drawings of 
Glenn
 and 
Hershel
. Daryl tells her they'll leave for Alexandria in the morning. She asks why he left Hilltop and he says he'll tell her that story another day. The next day, Lydia and the others return to Alexandria. She then plays with the group in a snowball fight.

We Are the End of the World

In the past, Lydia and her mother walk among walkers covered in blood when they come upon an injured woman being devoured. When a walker bumps into her, Lydia drops her earmuffs and screams. They are forced to run and seek shelter inside an abandoned hospital, where they find a man wearing a ski mask.

Alpha explains to the masked man that she and her daughter don't mean harm. He allows them to stay for the night. Later, Alpha cleans Lydia in a bathtub. Lydia is scared by the sound of walkers but Alpha insists she just listens to it. They look through supplies and eat. At night, Alpha tries to give Lydia her rabbit toy before sleeping but Lydia doesn't want it anymore. She tells Alpha that she wants to be like her. Alpha is thrilled by this but tells her to stop calling her mama.

Lydia then wakes up in the middle of the night and smears blood Alpha has collected all over her. She leaves the room and wanders around the hospital in an effort to make herself braver. After hearing screams, Lydia arrives at another room and stops the man from killing Alpha. She hugs her mother and she tells her not to leave her side again. Lydia then watches as Alpha lifts the man's mask to look at his face and chuckles, seemingly recognizing him. Sometime later, they leave the hospital together.

Later that day, Lydia goes to the dining hall and sits at the table of Gage, Margo, and Alfred. She skins a squirrel in front of them, mocks the shushing motion and smiles as they leave disgusted. However, Daryl later tells her to not do that again but she defends herself and storms out. That night, Lydia walks around and is ambushed by her bullies. Margo blames her for putting her friends' heads on spikes but Lydia reminds them she wasn't involved and says she's one of them. They throw Lydia into the ground and start violently punching her. Suddenly, Negan arrives and in order to protect Lydia, accidentally throws Margo into a wall, killing her.

When Daryl and the other residents arrive to assess the situation, Alfred blames Negan for Margo's death but Lydia screams it wasn't his fault. Daryl believes her but orders Negan back to his cell. She is then taken to the infirmary to be bandaged by 
Dante
. Later, Daryl checks on her and she claims that her 
father
 would've protected her. Daryl hugs her and she tells him Negan saved her. The following morning, Lydia realizes Negan has escaped his cell and claims she is responsible before heading to his cell to lock herself in. Daryl rushes over and tells her she didn't leave the house that night. However, Lydia chooses to stay in the cell because she feels safer and laments she couldn't be like him.



"
Open Your Eyes
"


Lydia is trying to read a book in her cell when Daryl arrives and signals her to get out while 
Carol
 escorts a 
captured Whisperer
 inside. She is then questioned by Carol about their prisoner and she reveals he is one of the Whisperers in charge of herding the walkers. Lydia then sees as Gabriel berates Carol for her actions. As he leaves, Carol tells Lydia she can stay in her house in the meantime. She then heads to the balcony.

While watching the community, Carol offers Lydia ointment for her scars but she says she has had worse injuries before. When Carol replies that she has sustained worse injuries as well, Lydia is left thinking about her past. She then reveals that the captured Whisperer won't betray Alpha because he is loyal, but if they show him that a place like Alexandria can survive, there's nothing Alpha can do to stop the idea from spreading among the group. 

Later that day, Lydia is brought by Carol to the cell so the Whisperer can realize that she is alive but they are forced to leave by Daryl after he dies from poisoning. Carol then asks Lydia for her help in something and they ride off of Alexandria towards the woods. That night, they arrive at one of the borders on a bridge where 
Gamma
 is holding Aaron at knifepoint. When a shocked Gamma flees, Lydia realizes Carol used her for her own purposes. Carol tries to explain to Lydia that Alpha lied to the Whisperers about killing her but Lydia compares her to Alpha. She then says she chooses her own side and hits Carol with her staff before crossing into the border as well.



"
Stalker
"


Over the next two days alone in the woods, Lydia rethinks her actions and chooses to rejoin the communities since, despite their flaws, they are the closest chance of her having a normal life. During her travels, she passes by an abandoned gas station and finds Alpha and Daryl lying injured and bloody inside the workshop. Lydia decides to save Daryl over her own mother and picks up his crossbow before walking towards a dizzy Alpha.

When Alpha briefly wakes up and sees Lydia, she wonders if she's real and starts to sing a lullaby while placing her daughter's hands on the knife above her heart, saying she's ready to lead the Whisperers after her death. Lydia tearfully declines to kill her mother and says she blames her for not letting her live a normal life like she always wanted. 

Before leaving her agonizing mother behind, Lydia carves the words "Your way is not the only way" into a bench and carries Daryl away. During the rest of the night, she tends to his wounds and watches over him while deciding what to do. When Daryl awakens the next morning and asks about Alpha, Lydia responds that she couldn't bring herself to kill her mother.



"
Morning Star
"


Lydia and Daryl arrive at the Hilltop. The pair reveal that Alpha is coming. Daryl and Lydia joins the discussion about what should be done. Lydia thinks they should run, explaining that even if the explosion at the cave took out half the horde, Alpha would still have thousands of walkers left. Earl thinks the Whisperers might bypass them and go for Alexandria first, but Lydia negates this. Jerry wishes to stay and fight instead, while Dianne agrees with Lydia, believing that they can rebuild in another location. Earl is skeptical, however, and reckons that they will never find a place as good as Hilltop. While Yumiko points out they're heavily outnumbered, Earl insists that fighting is the best course of action, and even if they die, they will die for a place that means something. Aaron points out that there are children at Hilltop, too.

Lydia tearfully inspects the engraving Henry made for her, when Carol sits next to her. After lighting a cigarette, Carol says that Lydia should hate her, to which the latter replies that it's hard for her to do so, since Carol already seems to hate herself so much. Carol vows to kill Alpha, but Lydia points out that it won't save them. Carol replies that it will feel good, and asks if Lydia will hate her then. Lydia coldly states that she wont be thinking about Carol at all. Carol chuckles and thanks her for telling the truth. Lydia observes that people don't know how to do that anymore, so they simply stay away from both of them. Carol mournfully says that she had a life, to which Lydia simply replies "I know".

As everyone is gathered on the front lines, including Lydia. Daryl walks out to join the army. They are standing at the gate with their shields. Daryl takes the lead. Kelly confirms that the horde is close. Indeed, the horde soon emerges from the bushes and approaches the Hilltop. While they are momentarily halted by the electric fence, the walkers soon break through it and approach the second line of defense. Aaron orders the survivors to split ranks. The shield-wielding survivors reinforce the makeshift barbed wire fence, while the melee weapon-wielding survivors start taking out the walkers. The archers, meanwhile, stay in the back and rain arrows on the herd.

Behind the herd, Beta commands the Whisperers to launch the sap they collected earlier using makeshift catapults into the front lines, drenching most of the defenders as well as the Hilltop's walls. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltop resident ablaze. With no choice, Daryl tells the defenders to begin to retreat towards the Hilltop, but are trapped when the Whisperers launch another volley of fire-arrows into the Hilltop's walls, setting the community ablaze.



"
Walk With Us
"


Lydia participates in the battle to protect 
Hilltop
, killing invading walkers using her 
staff
. 
Mary
 tries to convince Lydia to flee, knowing that 
Alpha
 still wants her, but Lydia refuses, stating that she will never walk with the Whisperers again. She resumes fighting.

Like the other survivors of the battle, Lydia ultimately flees, but is left with an injured leg and uses her staff as a walking stick. Wandering through the nearby forest, Lydia encounters 
Negan
 and is initially pleased to see her friend. However, she quickly realizes that he is working for Alpha and becomes alarmed. Negan easily overpowers and disarms Lydia, taking her captive.

Negan subsequently leads Alpha to a shed where Lydia is located, Alpha intending to kill her daughter so that Lydia will reanimate and remain by her side as part of the horde, refusing to be dissuaded by Negan. As Alpha approaches the shed, a frightened Lydia manages to free herself and opens the door to an empty field. Meanwhile, Alpha finds the shed Negan took her to empty. It's revealed that Negan used Lydia to bait a trap to lure out and kill Alpha, which he does moments after she discovers his deception.



"
Look at the Flowers
"


Negan
 returns to where he stashed Lydia, only to find her gone. Having been informed of what Negan did by Lydia, 
Daryl
 is waiting to ambush Negan who insists that he never intended Lydia any harm, keeping her safely out of harm's way while using her as bait to lure out 
Alpha
 and kill her.



"
The Tower
"


While taking refuge in an 
abandoned hospital
 after leaving Alexandria due to the threat of Beta's herd, Judith approaches Lydia, who is petting a cat. Judith offers condolences for her mother's death, but Lydia tells her she doesn't have to do that. When asked, Lydia denies that she misses her mother, and tells Judith that not everyone gets to have a mom like hers. Later, Lydia is petting Dog when Negan comes over and offers her something to eat. Lydia, however, claims she isn't hungry. Negan asks if she is avoiding him, and Lydia bluntly confirms. Negan is taken aback by her honesty, to which Lydia bitterly asks if he wants her to lie to make him feel better. Negan denies this, and goes on to state that he liked her mother despite her inexcusable crimes, wishing that he didn't have to kill her. Still, he encourages Lydia to say whatever she has to say to him. Lydia coldly replies that most of them wish that Negan had died as well, before taking her leave.

Lydia later angrily approaches Negan and declares that he can't tell her what to do. Negan calmly acknowledges this, and invites Lydia to hit him, as it will make her feel better. Lydia claims that she feels fine, but Negan is adamant that she has to mourn her mother, or it will continue to eat her up on the inside. Despite everything, Negan claims, Alpha was still her mother, and if she doesn't let it all out, she will drift further away from the other survivors, which Negan is certain Lydia don't wants. Lydia rhetorically asks what Negan knows about what she wants, and calls him a selfish asshole, believing he only killed Alpha so that people believe that he's a hero, but the people will never see him as such, since he only cares about himself. Lydia believes that him trying to get her to open up is also for selfish reasons, and wonders how he could have ever liked her mother. She is adamant that she hated her mother, or wants to hate her in any case, and yells at Negan for saying she can't even do that. Despite this, Negan tells her it's okay, prompting Lydia to break down in anger and tears as Negan embraces her.



"
A Certain Doom
"


Lydia joins in the planning session for getting rid of 
Beta
's horde and offers her help in transporting the equipment through to the other side. However, 
Rachel
 and 
Beatrice
 refuse to trust Lydia and 
Gabriel
 states that they need her help in 
the Tower
 anyway. Lydia approaches 
Carol
 and offers to talk if she needs it and makes it clear that while she's not looking for a new mother, she wants Carol as a friend. Carol in turn suggests that Lydia find her own way instead of letting others decide it for her.

As the group makes its way through the horde, Lydia helps 
Dianne
 pick out 
Whisperers
 to target before Beta turns the horde, making it harder. With the Whisperers breaking in, 
Negan
 approaches Lydia and suggests that she make a run for it as he thinks the survivors are doomed. Lydia points out that he could do the same and suggests that he help. Negan provides Lydia with her mother's walker mask, driving her to tears, before he departs.

Shortly thereafter, Lydia, covered in walker guts and dressed in Alpha's mask, picks up the backpack that Beatrice dropped and joins the rest of 
Daryl
's group. Armed with a bow, Lydia helps to protect the wagon carrying the sound system as it draws the horde away from the Tower and spots when Whisperers begin making their approach to attack, warning the others. Together, Lydia and the others attempt to stop the Whisperers to no avail and the wagon and sound system are destroyed.

Regrouping in the nearby woods and spotting the horde heading back towards the Tower, the group begins working out what to do next. Lydia suggests that once the Whisperers in the herd are gone, she can lead them away as Alpha taught her how to. Though Lydia insists that she can do it, 
Luke
 points out that since there is no longer a wagon to lead the herd over the cliff, it is a suicide mission. As the group begins assassinating the surviving Whisperers, Beta notices Lydia moving through the herd, once again in Alpha's mask and guiding the herd away. As Beta attempts to go after her, he is stopped by Negan and Daryl and finally killed.

The next morning, Lydia leads the herd onto a high cliff overlooking a river. As they get close to the edge, Carol approaches Lydia from behind and orders her to go and let Carol finish the job. As Carol and the horde approach the edge, Lydia suddenly grabs Carol's hand and yanks her back to safety behind a rock. Removing her mask, Lydia reminds Carol that Carol had told her to find her own way and Carol thanks her as the two embrace, crying. Carol and Lydia watch as the horde walks over the cliff to their demise and Lydia throws Alpha's mask over with them. Once the walkers are all gone, Carol and Lydia stand on the cliff's edge, looking down after them.

With the horde destroyed, the two return to the survivors' camp where Carol credits Lydia with ensuring the destruction of the horde once and for all and the threat of the Whisperers but Lydia shares credit with Carol. Noticing Negan amongst the group, Lydia asks if he is going to stay and Negan tells that he is 
"for now."
 Negan and Lydia share a hug as everyone celebrates.

Variant
"


En-route to Oceanside, Lydia and Elijah flirt and laugh with one another.

Lydia and Elijah silently listen as Aaron disagrees with Jerry's suggestion to make camp and follow his plan to off-road the wagon to make better time to Oceanside. 

While off-roading, the wagon becomes stuck in a ditch and in an attempt to pull it out, Jerry becomes injured. Lydia rushes to his side with concern and helps him stand. She helps carry Jerry to a nearby renaissance fair, where they will camp out for the night. Lydia collects firewood with Elijah, and offers to light the fire for him. The two almost kiss, but Lydia pulls away last second and guiltily walks off to look for more firewood. She overhears Aaron talking about taking first watch, and Lydia offers to stay up with him. 

While on watch with Aaron, he asks Lydia if she would prefer to do the shift with Elijah. When Lydia declines, Aaron is concerned if there is a reason she is avoiding spending time with Elijah. Lydia finally admits to Aaron that she feels guilty for having a crush on Elijah after Henry, and is afraid of getting close to another person. Upon hearing her fear, Aaron opens up to Lydia about his own experience with being scarred about saying yes to a new relationship. Aaron tells her about the time that he first met his 
late husband
 and how he rejected him for several months, and regrets doing so because it was the happiest time of his life, and if he had the chance he'd take back all the time he said no. 

Later that night, Lydia and Aaron sit by a campfire and hear a strange noise in the distance. Lydia is startled, and Aaron tells her that its most likely the wind and reminds her that they have the fairgrounds several times and secured the entrances. Lydia settles at his words before hearing the strange noise again, and Aaron agrees that they should go check it out. The two discover that a herd of walkers have gotten in. Aaron checks in with Lydia to make sure that she's comfortable fighting, and she assures him that she is. Lydia is able to kill some walkers before getting overwhelmed when one grabs her staff and doesn't let go. Lydia pulls out her knife and stabs the walker in the heart, believing it to be a Whisperer. She pushes her opponent back, and retreats with Aaron, screaming for Elijah and Jerry to wake up.

"
Faith
"


In the woods, Lydia puts down a walker with her knife against the objections of 
Elijah
 who is worried that it could've been one of the climber variants. Although 
Jerry
 makes a joke about it, 
Aaron
 warns the others that they all need to stay alert as they don't know if their 
encounter
 with a climber was a one-time thing or not and there might be more of them out here. Aaron notices footsteps nearby, but Lydia recognizes them as being human, not walker. Aaron's group readies themselves to defend against possible threats, but 
Luke
 and 
Jules
 emerge from the trees instead. The friends are happily reunited with each other while Aaron introduces Luke and Jules to Elijah whom they have yet to meet. Jerry invites the two to join them in journeying to 
Oceanside
, but Luke explains that 
"it's gone, man. It ain't ours anymore. These guys in white gear 
showed up
 and... said they were from the Commonwealth"
 with Jules adding that they had just taken over. Aaron is surprised as they had 
made a deal
 with the Commonwealth, but Luke tells him that something must've changed as the Commonwealth Army is tracking him and Jules right now and they're dead if they're found. Luke suggests getting far away from Oceanside as humanly possible which Aaron agrees with. Shocked by the news, everyone begins moving out.

Aaron's group puts down several walkers and Luke and Jules explain that they were out scavenging and thus they weren't present when 
Lance Hornsby
's men arrived at Oceanside. They were hiding behind the houses trying to figure out what the hell to do with Luke wanting to stay and fight. However, 
Rachel
 wasn't having it and she insisted that they had to go, warn everybody and tell them what was coming which is why Luke and Jules had left in the end. Luke and Jules haven't seen Rachel or any of the others since and Luke feels guilty that they didn't stay and fight. Jerry and Aaron reassure them that they've got the group and everyone else now who are heading for Alexandria right now. Luke asks if that includes his old 
group
 which Aaron confirms. Hearing the sound of engines nearby, everyone quickly hides behind the wagon. Lydia and Elijah realize that the soldiers are closing in and that they can't outrun them. Spotting a 
herd
 moving nearby, Lydia looks at one of the dead walkers and gets an idea.

That night, Aaron's group, 
covered in walker guts
, moves with the massive herd, Lydia whispering directions to the others to move east. Two Commonwealth jeeps drive up and begins leading the herd in another direction, forcing Aaron, Lydia, Elijah, Jerry, Luke and Jules to follow them in order to maintain their cover. Lydia is bumped into by a walker, causing her to drop her knife which is then picked up by a variant walker that's amongst the herd.

Family
"


In the woods, a Commonwealth jeep leads a large 
herd
, amongst them 
Aaron
, Lydia, 
Elijah
, 
Jerry
, 
Luke
 and 
Jules
, 
covered in walker guts
. Spotting a break ahead to the right, Aaron whispers the message that it's now their chance with the others planning to make a break for the trees. However, as the group begins to make their break for it, a soldier pulls up on a motorcycle, leading a second herd in from the side that joins up with the massive herd that the jeep is leading, trapping Aaron's group amongst the walkers once more. From the other side, a third herd is brought in by another motorcycle, resulting in a massive herd of thousands of walkers having been corralled together by two Commonwealth jeeps and two motorcycles. Having completed their mission, the soldiers drive off, leaving the herd heading towards 
the Commonwealth
 itself which is just miles away.

As they continue, Aaron spots an abandoned RV up ahead and directs the others towards it. Putting down a walker in the RV, Aaron, Jerry and Lydia manage to get inside, but Jules gets swept away by the herd and Luke goes after his girlfriend. Trying to enter the RV, Elijah gets caught in the herd and as Lydia desperately tries to hang on to her boyfriend's hand, she is bitten in the left arm by a walker before Aaron and Jerry pull her into the RV as Elijah gets swept away as well. As the herd continues on towards the Commonwealth, a number of walkers begin banging on the RV's door, trying to get at the survivors within.

In the RV, Lydia frantically tries to go back out into the herd to search for Elijah, unwilling to risk losing him, while Aaron and Jerry try to stop her in order to deal with her bite. Aaron finally manages to get Lydia to see reason by pointing out that if they don't act quickly, Elijah will lose her instead. Jerry promises that they will find him as soon as they can, but they have to 
amputate her arm
 first. Lydia takes a seat and Jerry makes a torniquet for her out of his belt. Aaron reminds Lydia that he lost his arm too and he made it alright and reassures Lydia that she is so loved. Aaron promises Lydia that they will get her through this before Jerry chops her arm off with his sword.

Lydia regains consciousness in the RV as walkers bang on the outside from all sides. Despite being weak from blood loss, Lydia insists that they have to go after the others who need their help. Aaron states that Lydia needs a doctor first while Jerry tries to reassure her that Elijah, Luke and Jules are all pros. Lydia tearfully refuses to abandon their friends, stating that they don't leave each other and the others need them. Aaron and Jerry embrace the sobbing girl and Jerry decides to go back into the herd by himself to find the others, stating that Lydia has lost enough. Ordering Aaron and Lydia to get her arm looked at, Jerry promises that they will meet up later, 
"I find them... I find you. Piece of cobbler. See you on the other side."
 Zipping up his jacket and pulling up his hood, Jerry opens the door and carefully slips back into the herd which continues to ignore him due to the walker guts covering Jerry.

' deaths, Lydia is upset and believes that the still-missing Elijah and Jerry are dead too. 
"That's just what happens. You know, people die. Cities fall. And things just don't work out. People tell me they do, but they don't."
 However, Aaron refuses to give up hope that their friends are still alive somewhere and he promises that they will find them both. A concerned Maggie enters, looking for Negan, but nobody has seen him in awhile.

Suddenly, there's shouts outside and two gunshots. Looking outside, Mercer sees a man trying to climb the wall, only to be shot by Commonwealth soldiers on Pamela's orders. Mercer tells the others that the soldiers are shooting anyone that climbs the gates and grabs a gun, unwilling to just stand by as people are dying. Mercer informs the Coalition members that the truck is gassed up with enough reserves in the rear to get them home. Mercer and his men can sneak them out the back as Mercer believes that this isn't their fight or their people. 
"Yes, they are. And so are you,"
 states Ezekiel. Addressing the others, Ezekiel tells them that 
"you may not think this place is worth saving, and I get that, given how they treated us. But it's worth it to me. The people are worth it, and I'm not gonna allow them to fall without a fight. Not today. I'm with you. Who else?"
 Aaron immediately agrees, stating that they can do more than just save themselves and they need to. Following Ezekiel's lead, everyone agrees to fight to save the Commonwealth.

At the gates of the Estates, the crowd desperately begs Pamela to be let in, amongst them 
Mr. Martens
, 
Mrs. Martens
 and 
Mei
. On a balcony, Maggie lines up her shot on Pamela, but Negan tells her to hold on as Mercer and his loyalist forces move in, ordering Colonel 
Vickers
 and her men to lower their weapons. Pamela orders Vickers to arrest them, but the Coalition forces join Mercer's troops from another angle, creating a standoff. Pamela accuses Mercer of being a traitor, but Mercer states that she's the true traitor and lists Pamela's crimes: disappearing hundreds of citizens, leading the dead to their doorstep, shooting a child and now leaving thousands to die.

The banging on the gates grows more frantic as the herd begins to approach the Estates, meaning that the people will die if they're not let inside. Gabriel moves towards the gates despite Vickers orders to stop. Gabriel announces that they're opening the gate and letting everyone inside, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him. Vickers threatens to shoot him, but Carol warns her that they will fire back if she does. Pamela orders her men to shoot Gabriel as he reaches the gates and one of them points a gun at his head. Suddenly, Daryl yells for them to stop. 
"What the hell you doing?"
 Daryl demands. 
"We all deserve better than this. You built this place to be like the old world. That was the fuckin' problem."
 Pamela states that if she opens the gates, the dead will get in too, not just the living. Daryl tells her that if she doesn't, Pamela will lose everything anyway. 
"We got one enemy. We ain't the walking dead."


Realizing that Daryl is right, Vickers orders everyone to lower their weapons and give Gabriel the key to the gates. Everyone stands down and Vickers defers to Mercer's command who places Pamela under arrest for high crimes against the people of the Commonwealth. As everyone rushes to help let the people in, Maggie informs Negan that Pamela is getting arrested and Negan tells her that prison is a fate worse than death for someone like Pamela, causing Maggie to relent in shooting her.

The crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in 
Alexandria
 and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified 
Lance Hornsby
, Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of 
suicide
. Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rife, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back.

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates.

Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

In Alexandria, everyone enjoys a celebration and feast, joined by Mercer, Max and Tomi. Judith gives 
Dog
 some of her food and Yumiko raises a toast to Luke. Looking out the window, Daryl sees Negan walking away and the two men exchange a smile and a nod, parting on good terms. Yumiko turns to Magna, telling her 
"same"
 and Magna kisses her, the two women resuming their romantic relationship. Sitting down, Rosita smiles as she watches the celebration before becoming somber. Noticing Rosita's somber mood, Gabriel joins her, and Rosita tells him that she just wants to remember this perfect moment. In a whisper, Rosita reveals her bite and impending death to Gabriel. Noticing Rosita's behavior and crying, Judith realizes that something's wrong with her and becomes upset, apparently deducing the truth.

A year later, Judith spots Elijah and Lydia and greets her friends who now work as couriers for the combined communities while continuing to date each other. Lydia, who has a prosthetic left arm now, hands Judith a package that she says is supposed to be a surprise before she and Elijah walk off together.

In Alexandria, Daryl and Carol, who is now wearing her hair short again as she did before Rick's disappearance, look at the old memorial wall of the people that the community had lost. Alexandria has been fully rebuilt and is thriving again with the residents enjoying everyday life together. Aaron, Gabriel, Coco, and 
Gracie
 greet Lydia, Elijah, Judith and 
RJ
 and Lydia gives Gabriel a package from Father 
Grant
 and his 
old congregation
. Daryl and Carol join them while Jerry and 
Nabila
, walking through town as their daughters play outside, smile at them. Aaron admits that he never thought that they'd get back to any of this, although he had hope. Aaron calls them all very lucky, but Gabriel corrects Aaron that it's effort rather than luck. They have a lot to be proud of in their family, community, and future.

The group from the Commonwealth next visits a rebuilt and thriving 
Hilltop
 where Maggie and Hershel watch as Adam plays. Carol asks Maggie what she had wanted to talk about, and Maggie reveals that she wants to talk about the future. 
"There's a lot out there to find out about. And I think it's time we did."

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Molly
.
[2]


Lydia was affectionately named as "bug" by her parents.


Lydia suffers from gaslighting as a result of her mother's manipulation over the memories of her father. She also suffered from suicidal thoughts after the loss of Henry, though she had made great strides in recovery in Season 11.


Lydia bears several scars across her right arm which had been sustained from a birch tree whipping inflicted by Alpha.


Lydia is the first named Whisperer to appear in the show.


Unlike her comic book counterpart, Lydia is brunette instead of blonde.


Due to the lack of formal education during her time with the Whisperers, Lydia is illiterate, and is forced to learn to read with children who are much younger than herself.


Lydia wields 
Henry
's 
staff
 in 
Season 10
 following his death in "
The Calm Before
". She is shown to have added a nunchuck to it, something that neither Henry nor 
Morgan Jones
 ever used.


She is one of eleven known characters to have seen 
Beta
's face.

The other ten characters being 
Alpha
, 
Mary
, 
Daryl
, 
Negan
, Beta's 
best friend
, a 
Whisperer
, 
Daniel
, 
Grace
, 
Dennis
, and 
Silas
 with the latter four being unknowingly.


In "
Walk With Us
", an injured Lydia uses her 
staff
 as a walking stick like 
Henry
 did following the events of "
Chokepoint
" and 
Morgan Jones
 in the first half of 
Season 4
 of 
Fear the Walking Dead
 and later in "
... I Lose Myself
".


Lydia is the tenth main character in the TV Series to have an amputation. The first being 
Merle Dixon
, the second being 
Hershel Greene
, the third being 
The Governor
, the fourth being 
Bob Stookey
, the fifth being 
Gareth
, the sixth being 
Tyreese Williams
, the seventh being 
Jessie Anderson
, the eighth being 
Carl Grimes
, and the ninth being 
Aaron
.


Lydia is one of the five characters in The Walking Dead universe who survive a zombie bite due to amputation and confirmed to be alive, others being 
Lilly Caul
, 
Clementine
, 
Elton Ortiz
, and 
Alicia Clark
.


Lydia is one of twelve characters to survive the 
TV Series
 who also survive in the 
Comic Series
, the others being 
Maggie Rhee
, 
Michonne Grimes
, 
Eugene Porter
, 
Aaron
, 
Hershel Rhee
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Magna
, 
Yumiko Okumura
, 
Juanita Sanchez
, 
Michael Mercer
, and 
Pamela Milton
.


Lydia is one of the two 
TV Universe
 characters to appear in 
Tales of the Walking Dead
, the others being 
Alpha
.

Out of these, Lydia is the only one portrayed by different actors: 
Cassady McClincy
 
(
TV Series
)
 and 
Scarlett Blum
 
(
Tales
)
.


Scarlett Blum also portrayed a younger version of Lydia in the episode "
Dee
" of 
Tales of the Walking Dead
.


Lydia is the sixth and final main character to receive an amputation, with the first being 
Hershel Greene
, the second being 
Merle Dixon
, the third being 
Bob Stookey
, the fourth being 
Tyreese Williams
, and the fifth being 
Aaron
.


Despite Maggie mentioning that everyone who lived in Hilltop moved to the 
Bricks
, it is unknown if Lydia, 
Elijah
, and 
Adam
 are among the residents, as they did not appear nor were they mentioned in 
The Walking Dead: Dead City
.

However, given Lydia and Elijah's jobs as couriers, they may simply be elsewhere at the moment given the distance between the communities or they relocated to one of the other communities. Given Lydia's friendship with 
Negan
, it's likely that Maggie would've mentioned it if something had happened to her.
