Overview
[
]


Gabe is a taunting and intimidating individual. He clearly takes enjoyment out of messing with 
Andy
, making fun of him and mocking him. He likes to joke around, such as playing with "
Gregory
"'s head.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Gabe's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Gabe somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as one of the Satellite outpost guards.  

Gabe aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to 
Negan
's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 6

]


"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"
[
]


Gabe is on guard duty at the front entrance to the outpost he is stationed at. He orders 
Andy
 to halt and inspects 
Gregory
's head with his fellow Savior, trying to determine if it is real. After an intense few moments, he begins to play with the severed head and wipes his bloody hand on Andy's shirt. Gabe goes inside to retrieve 
Craig
 and returns outside where he is suddenly stabbed through the chest by Michonne.
