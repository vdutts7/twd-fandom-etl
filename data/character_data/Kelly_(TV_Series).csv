,,"Kelly is a fighter, yet compassionate and protective survivor. She's stubborn at times, but knows when to listen, especially when it comes to Connie's opinion, to whom she is very protective. Although she brings the balance to the group, she isn't listened to all the time.","Not much is known about Kelly's life prior to the outbreak. She was born to older parents as she was unexpected, and she had a much older sister, Connie . Connie was completely deaf from a genetic disorder, to which Kelly also had and was partially deaf. The family learned ASL to communicate with each other. Because Kelly's parents were older, they were too tired to raise her adequately - so Connie stepped in as a surrogate parent. By the time she was a high school student, she was worried about typical teenager things, but was also impressed by her sister, who had become an investigative journalist and helped uncover and lock up corrupt politicians.","At some point after the outbreak, Kelly and her sister Connie met girlfriends Magna and Yumiko Okumura , Luke Abrams , Bernie , among other survivors. The group survived for several years, eventually becoming closer and seeing each other as family. However, as the years went by, several members of the group died. The group resided in different communities, such as Jones Springs and Coalport , both which eventually fell causing the group's distrust in rejoining any other similar settlements. In the woods, Magna 's group take on a herd of walkers . They quickly get overwhelmed but they get saved when the walkers around them get shot from the trees. Kelly and the group escape into the woods to find a 9-year-old girl who asks for their names. They introduce themselves and ask what her name is. The girl picks up her hat and introduces herself as Judith Grimes . In the woods, Kelly and the group follow Judith as she leads them to Rosita , Eugene , Laura , and Aaron . Wanting to take them in, Judith declares she won't return to Alexandria until they accept them. The others reluctantly agree. Later, Kelly and the group arrive at Alexandria's gates and Judith assures them they'll be safe. They get escorted inside, where Gracie runs over to Aaron. Rosita updates Siddiq on Yumiko 's condition and he escorts her to the infirmary. Magna tries to tag along but is stopped by D.J . Michonne arrives on horseback and doesn't look pleased to see the new arrivals. She frisks Magna and asks Eugene why they're here. Aaron claims it was his call but Michonne reminds him it's not his call to make. ""I decided,"" Judith tells her. Michonne scolds her but Aaron says they’re here now and they should decide their fate together, while Gabriel suggests they vote tomorrow. Michonne agrees and instructs her people to put them in holding. The next day, Kelly and the group stand before the Alexandria council for questioning. They ask who their leader is and Magna claims they're a team, while Luke explains their group used to be bigger and that they just lost their friend, Bernie . Gabriel asks about their former professions. Luke was a music teacher, Magna was a truck stop waitress, Connie was a journalist and Kelly was a high school student. Luke says they should trust them, but Michonne isn't done with questions. She stands up and asks Magna to see her left hand, which has a prison tattoo. Michonne then calls her out for the hidden knife on her belt, which she puts on the table. Michonne storms out, saying she'll second any of their motions. Magna tries to question her but is shut off. Later, in the infirmary, Siddiq updates Kelly and the rest on Yumiko's condition. Luke asks him if he has been there since the start but Siddiq confesses that he was also found in the woods , but things were different in the past . At night, Kelly and the rest scold Magna for ruining their chance to stay. Luke asks Magna to hand over her necklace, which also doubles as a knife, but she's reluctant. Magna says they should fight their way through Alexandria to take their supplies before heading out, but Connie tells her to leave Michonne and Judith out of it. Luke says they save the fighting for people who deserve it, and Magna finally surrenders the necklace. The next day, Kelly and the group prepares to leave by thanking everyone for their hospitality. Kelly laughs as Judith says to Connie she will practice her ASL. Michonne rides up and says she's going to instead escort them to Hilltop with Siddiq. On the road to Hilltop, Siddiq tells Michonne she should have let Magna's group stay in Alexandria, but she says she still doesn't trust them and is only doing this for her daughter. In the cart, Magna complains to her group that Michonne has her knives and she wants them back. Yumiko tells Michonne she's just upset about their lost friend, Bernie. A while later, Michonne and the others arrive at Magna's giant crate of supplies, which have been displaced and destroyed by walkers. Magna’s upset at the sight of Bernie's things while Michonne instructs D.J. to gather more of their weapons. This angers them, and Michonne also announces she's returning to Alexandria in the morning while Siddiq and D.J. help them finish the journey. Magna and Luke start to get riled up, but Yumiko calms them down and reluctantly agrees to her terms. They decide to find shelter for the night. At night, inside a factory, Kelly and Connie sleep side by side. She and the rest wake up after hearing Michonne slice Luke's Stradivarius in half. Luke gawks at his broken Stradivarius in disbelief and explains to Michonne how old and rare it was. Yumiko lays her head on Magna's leg and playfully recalls the mansion they found it in. Luke says the Stradivarius is the one thing that separates them from the animals and how it brought humans together in the past, leaving Michonne in thought. In the morning, Siddiq tries again to convince Michonne to come with them but she says she can't take the risk with Maggie. Siddiq reveals to her that Maggie and Hershel left last fall, shocking her. Before he can explain, D.J. arrives to let them know that there are walkers outside. The group gets out to find several walkers blocking the path to their horses. Michonne kills several walkers as Magna demands they get back their weapons. Michonne finally relents and orders D.J. to return them their weapons. As Magna's group splits up and take out several walkers, an undead Bernie appears, deeply upsetting them. A heartbroken Magna can't put him down, so Michonne does it for her. The group opens a clear path and leave. On the road, Michonne empathizes with Yumiko and Magna, saying that she understands their pain of losing a friend considered family. Suddenly, two Hilltop soldiers ride up to them to inform that Rosita's injured and being cared for at Hilltop. Michonne instructs them to tell Hilltop they're on their way. Connie notices something nearby, confusing the group, but tells them it's nothing. As they leave, someone watches them from the bushes. At Hilltop, everyone runs inside as Michonne and Siddiq arrive with Magna and her group. From the guard post, Dianne makes them all surrender their weapons before entering. Inside, Tara coldly greets Michonne and updates her on Eugene, Aaron, Daryl, and Rosita's situations. She then informs Kelly and the rest of the group that they’ll have to wait for Jesus to return before deciding on their future, but they can stay until he gets back. Connie thanks her for everyone. In the woods, Kelly and her group follow Tara in the search for Alden and Luke. They find a group of walkers feasting on their horses and kill them, while checking they aren't Whisperers. Connie notices that the horses were cut open and skinned with knives. Tara realizes that Lydia lied about it just being her mother out there and decides they should go back to Hilltop until they find out what this is. Later, in their trailer, Yumiko suggests they leave to search for Luke again but Magna warns they could lose everything if they disobey Tara's wishes. Kelly reveals that she saw some kids sneak out of Hilltop and agrees with Yumiko that they should search for Luke. They take a vote and decide to leave that night. At night, in the woods, Kelly and the rest find a new set of tracks that could be from the Whisperers. As a herd approaches, Yumiko has second thoughts about leaving. Magna and Connie back her up, but Kelly breaks down, reminding them Luke saved her in Coalport. Connie comforts her and tells Magna and Yumiko to return without them and she'll stay and talk to Kelly. Unbeknownst to them, a Whisperer watches them from the woods. In the morning, Kelly is escorted by guards to Hilltop as Connie follows behind. Suddenly, a small group of Whisperers approaches the gates, making Connie hide in the cornfield. Kelly tries to run to her sister but is grabbed by the guards and is rushed inside. At Hilltop, Kelly watches with her binoculars at Connie hiding in the cornfield and then listens as Alpha and the Whisperers wait for them to bring Lydia to her. Daryl asks them to leave and Alpha signals for more Whisperers to show up. Magna asks Alpha if they killed their people. Alpha says no and promises if they don't bring her Lydia there will be conflict. Daryl then decides to walk outside to talk to Alpha face to face, to which Kelly is unsure of. From the guard post, Kelly watches as Daryl walks outside and Alpha instructs one of her people to bring someone. Daryl informs Alpha he's ready to fight her people to ensure she doesn't get Lydia back, when he then spots one of the Whisperers with a baby. Alpha explains they're animals and ""animals have babies."" Suddenly, a couple of whisperers bring up a tied up Alden and Luke. Alpha offers to trade both of them for her daughter. A while later, Connie runs out of the cornfield, sling-shots a walker, and grabs the baby to save it from a nearby herd. The Whisperers around her unsheathe blades as Connie escapes back into the cornfield. Daryl runs in and kills the walkers around her while Kelly, Tammy, and Earl step in to rescue her. Later, Lydia and Henry return to Hilltop and Daryl goes outside to make the trade. From the gates, Kelly watches as Daryl hands Lydia over to Alpha in exchange for Alden and Luke. Yumiko hugs Luke and gets him inside, where he is embraced by the rest of his group. Kelly then watches as Lydia apologizes to her mother and Alpha smacks her across the face, ordering her to address her as Alpha like everyone else. She then smiles at Daryl as they leave. At night, Kelly drinks and celebrates Luke's safety alongside her companions. On the road, Kelly and Tara's group clear a tree from their path to the Kingdom to ensure the roads are cleared for Alden's convoy carrying the food and trade goods for the fair. Kelly lets Tara know she's worried about Connie, but she assures her she's fine with Daryl. Magna and Yumiko also tell her that Connie is taking care of him. Later, a small herd of walkers approaches the group. They get in position and remind themselves to watch for the Whisperers. Suddenly, the Highwaymen ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara after helping to take down the herd. They then escort them to the Kingdom, having accepted Carol's deal. In the Kingdom, Kelly helps unload the trade goods and interacts with the welcoming Kingdommmers. In the Kingdom, Kelly and a group gear up to go look for Connie as the fair starts. Suddenly, Daryl, Michonne, and the convoy arrives. Kelly runs happily to her sister and hugs her. Later, Kelly says goodbye to Yumiko and Magna as they prepare to leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. In the fair, Connie apologizes to Kelly for leaving in a rush and confess she saved the baby because she still hasn't moved on from a past trauma. Later, Kelly and Connie try to help Earl look for Tammy around the fair. The next day, in the Kingdom, Kelly listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen. Some months after the blizzard, Kelly and the Coalition form a militia in order to train the several residents of the communities to face any future treats. She takes part in a training exercise on the Oceanside beach. As Ezekiel and Jerry methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Kelly and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat. Later on, Kelly helps the Oceanside residents pull some fishing nets from the sea. She tells Connie she's worried her gradual hearing loss will prevent her from translating for her. Connie assures her that she'll be okay and they should see their deafness as a superpower. Suddenly, Dog runs over with Daryl following behind. Kelly gives Connie a look suggesting she and Daryl are into each other, but Connie just rolls her eyes. That night, Kelly and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. The group runs out of water as a herd of walkers approaches the group. With their backs to the fire, the group prepares for a fight. Kelly and the group take their formations and start fighting off the herd. As they keep killing the walkers, Daryl tosses an axe to cut a tree down and have it fall onto some walkers. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers. She then helps out Eugene scrap the fallen satellite for any valuable part. Kelly is alerted to the commotion of a tree falling onto a house and a portion of Hilltop's walls. Luke wonders if the Whisperers are responsible, and Kelly is left thinking about that. She then helps the other residents rescue the trapped injured from the rubble. The next day, the residents realize that a small herd has arrived outside the community walls. Kelly and a group head outside to fight them off. That night, Kelly and the other residents kill the incoming walkers with the help of the Alexandria convoy when the herd invades the community. The following morning, Kelly hugs Luke goodbye as he rides with the parting group towards Oceanside and watches as they leave the community. Sometime following the attack on Hilltop, Kelly and Magna decide to keep a crate from Oceanside alongside other supplies they had been previously stealing from the community for weeks in a secret place somewhere in the woods due to their lack of confidence on the Hilltop being a longterm safe place for their group due to past experiences. Kelly then accompanies a group to hunt but decides to stay back in the woods with the promise of meeting them back at Hilltop. While tracking a wild boar, she starts struggling with her hearing. Kelly hits her target and puts the boar out of its misery when a walker approaches her. Kelly kills it as more arrive and devour the boar. She sprints away through the woods until she trips and falls down a hill injuring herself. A walker silently creeps up behind her as Kelly starts passing out. Somehow she manages to kill it and escape safely. Later that day, Kelly is found resting under a tree by Daryl, Connie, and Magna. As they give her water, Kelly insists to Magna they tell Daryl and Connie about the supplies they've been taking. Daryl is mad about them hiding the supplies and Connie suggests they lie and say they found it in the woods. When the group later arrives back at Hilltop, Kelly is taken to the infirmary to be treated for her injuries. Kelly is part of the group from Hilltop to meet up with Daryl, Carol, and Aaron in the woods to go find the horde following Gamma's intel. She greets her companions and hugs Aaron after not having seen him for a while. That night, the group crosses one of the borders in the woods to continue their mission. The next day, the group arrives at the location of the horde in a clearing only to find it's empty, so they leave to go search for the missing Lydia. When Carol chases after Alpha into a dark building, Kelly and the others follow her inside. The group then falls below a cave into a trap where they find themselves surrounded by most of the horde. Having become trapped in the cave with the horde, Kelly and the group recover from the fall and realize Alpha is watching them from the top as they look around for a possible exit. She watches as Carol screams in anger and later as Magna tries to climb a wall in vain. The group starts seeking other avenues of escape and eventually they decide to jump from rock to rock onto the other side of the cave in order to find another exit. As the group moves through the cave, Kelly points out that they don't have enough food to stay there forever. Jerry assures her there has to be an exit since walkers managed to get inside. Shortly after, Kelly asks Connie if she thinks its dark outside but she tells her not to think about it. When Magna is ambushed by a Whisperer, the group engages in a fight and kills several Whisperers, before deciding to follow the ones who escaped to find the exit. They follow the path and squeeze trough narrow tunnels until they find an underground mine station where she discovers a box of dynamite. When Carol accidentally drops a stick of dynamite in an effort to destroy the herd, the explosion causes the cave to begin collapsing. Kelly and Aaron make it to the surface and kill some Whisperers while Jerry holds a beam to prevent it from collapsing as they wait for the others. Daryl and Carol escape but Magna and Connie stay back and kill several Whisperers to protect Jerry, but he cannot hold the log anymore and leaves through the hole. The rest of the dynamite immediately explodes and the cave implodes, trapping Magna and Connie inside. Kelly falls to the ground in agony as Jerry holds her. She sobs for her sister's apparent death but snaps out of it and states that the explosion will attract walkers and Whisperers in the vicinity and they should leave because they won't be able to help Connie and Magna if they die. Daryl then tells the group to head home and inform everyone they found the horde, while he'll find the other entrance to the cave. Back at the Hilltop, Kelly wishes to join Luke's search party in an attempt to rescue her sister, while Luke cautions her against it, as her ankle is injured. Yumiko asks Kelly about Magna's last words to her, but the latter thinks them unimportant, since she believes they will rescue their friends. Annoyed at Yumiko's questioning, Kelly asks why she is coming with them if she thinks Magna and Connie are dead. They are interrupted by Daryl and Lydia's arrival. The pair reveal that Alpha is coming. The caravan returns to the Hilltop, with Daryl informing the others of the situation. Luke suggests calling Alexandria for reinforcements, but Dianne thinks that neither Alexandria nor Oceanside can get to them in time. Earl is confident that Hilltop is prepared, and tries to rally everyone for the upcoming conflict. Outside, Luke and Kelly are rigging the defenses when Yumiko joins them and apologizes to Kelly for being ""an asshole"". Kelly quickly forgives her with a hug, and is confident they will get Connie and Magna back ""cause assholes get shit done"". They are suddenly interrupted by dozens of rats fleeing from the bushes. Yumiko quickly realizes that the horde is coming, and orders everyone to prepare. With the Whisperers nearing with their horde everyone is gathered on the front lines. Kelly puts her palms on the ground and confirms that the horde is close. Indeed, the horde soon emerges from the bushes and approaches the Hilltop. While they are momentarily halted by the electric fence, the walkers soon break through it and approach the second line of defense. Aaron orders the survivors to split ranks. The shield-wielding survivors reinforce the makeshift barbed wire fence, while the melee weapon-wielding survivors start taking out the walkers. The archers, meanwhile, stay in the back and rain arrows on the herd. Behind the herd, Beta commands the Whisperers to launch the sap they collected earlier using makeshift catapults into the front lines, drenching most of the defenders as well as the Hilltop's walls. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltop resident ablaze. With no choice, the defenders begin to retreat towards the Hilltop, but are trapped when the Whisperers launch another volley of fire-arrows into the Hilltop's walls, setting the community ablaze. Kelly takes part in the failed defense of the Hilltop, ultimately fleeing with Alden , Adam , and Mary . Having only reluctantly allowed Mary to join them, Alden angrily refuses her help with Adam despite his own troubles in soothing the baby. Mary finally gets Alden to accept her advice and help, taking the baby and successfully soothing him. Seeing Mary's obvious affection for Adam causes Alden to finally soften his attitude towards her and ask about her sister, Adam's mother. When a herd arrives, Mary leads Alden, Kelly and Adam to an abandoned van, but refuses to join them, instead leading the walkers away. After Mary's brutal murder by Beta , the reanimated Mary is suddenly put down by Alden with an arrow to the head before Beta can lead her back to the Whisperers. Before Alden can shoot him too, Beta flees, leaving Alden with Kelly and Adam, upset at Mary's sacrifice for them. Kelly is among the Hilltop refugees to evacuate to the abandoned hospital being referred to as ""the tower"". Marco helps Kelly and Carol saddle up with a pair of horses as they head out to search for Connie. Kelly and Carol are seen scavenge wires from some cars. Carol thanks Kelly for coming and tries to apologize for her actions in the cave, but Kelly thinks nothing of it, as she is certain that her sister isn't dead. Although Kelly is uncertain if she feels this way because her sister is so tough or because Kelly simply won't accept that she's gone, she understands Carol's actions, although Carol doesn't believe this absolves her. Kelly recounts how, when she started losing her hearing, Connie told her that the disability wasn't her weakness, but her superpower. She then observes how everyone is learning sing language now because of her. She then tells Carol that she heard stories about her from before, and about how she'd always go off on her own and do the things only she could do, and assures Carol that this is not her weakness, but also a superpower. She concludes her thoughts by claiming that she you can't give up who you are because bad things happen. Kelly, Carol, Daryl and Judith make it safely to the Tower . Kelly is present as they go over the plan to lead the herd away. Kelly volunteers to go with Daryl out into the herd. As they cover themselves in guts to go in the horde, Daryl gives Kelly a Whisperer mask for protection. The group goes into the room, and Kelly puts on the Whisperer mask. Jerry opens the door to let the walkers inside, and Kelly and Daryl stick together squeezing past the walkers to get outside. While navigating through the herd, Kelly sticks close to Daryl when they spot a Whisperer nearby coming towards them with a knife. Before the Whisperer is able to stab Daryl, Dianne or Rachel shoots the Whisperer and the Whisperer get devoured by walkers. Kelly and Daryl maneuver past the walkers. Beta takes notice of the groups plan and orders the Whisperer's to tighten the herd. Harder for them to get through, Kelly grabs onto Daryl as they make it safely through the herd and reunite with Magna, Jerry, Jules and Luke. Carol and Lydia make it safely a few minutes later. For the second part of the plan, the group rides along with the sound system Luke created blasting loud music to lead the herd away. As night falls, Whisperers suddenly attack the group and the wheel to the wagon falls off. Kelly makes it off and flees with the rest as the Whisperers destroy the wagon and stop the music. Kelly is among the survivors as they hide in the woods and come up with a new plan: to kill the Whisperers in the herd. Kelly is then in the herd presumably killing the Whisperers. Kelly makes it back to the group in the woods the next day and Magna is seen patching up her wound. In the aftermath of the defeat of the Whisperers , Kelly asks Daryl to go with him to pick up Maggie 's people , wanting to keep an eye out for Connie as they cover some new ground. The two exchange a fist bump and Daryl invites Kelly along. As they push on, Maggie and Cole argue about finding shelter for the night and Maggie finally agrees when they reach a parking lot with some abandoned shipping containers. With a herd overrunning the parking lot, the group quickly begins clearing them out, something that Daryl and Kelly are uneasy about but go along with, but Maggie struggles to close a shipping container full of walkers, cutting herself in the process. While Kelly and Cole cover them from the walkers still wandering around, Maggie, Daryl and Elijah manage to seal the container with the rest of them inside. The next morning, when everyone wakes up, there's no sign of Kelly who is supposed to be on watch and a walker enters the parking lot, although Elijah quickly dispatches it. In the woods nearby, Kelly checks out an abandoned truck and finds a jacket on top of it, but she's stopped from climbing up and admonished by Maggie for leaving her post and running off on her own. Daryl explains for an emotional Kelly that her sister is missing, and Elijah climbs up and retrieves the jacket for Kelly. Now more sympathetic, Maggie explains that Elijah had just lost his sister too. However, none of the stuff on top of the truck belongs to Connie. Daryl admits to Maggie that he's searched for Connie a number of times, but he's never found her. While Daryl thinks that it might be best for Kelly not to know, Maggie disagrees. Much to everyone's horror, they find the rendezvous spot burned down, two dead bodies and no sign of anyone else. Cole realizes that they must've been followed by the Reapers despite being careful. Maggie and Cole reveal that the Reapers are the one who had attacked and destroyed their previous home . Daryl determines from the footprints that the Wardens scattered, running, and headed north, including Hershel . With the trail eventually splitting, Daryl and Maggie decide to split up the group to follow both trails against Cole's objections. Daryl and Maggie cross a stream together while Kelly, Cole and Elijah go in the other direction. The three hear the noise of something out there and Kelly tells Elijah that they have to move, but he freezes in fear and unmasks himself for Kelly who reassures Elijah that, while this is a lot, he's not alone, they have each other and Maggie's counting on them. Later, as Daryl and Maggie fight the Attacker , he is suddenly shot in the chest with an arrow by a Warden and is then quickly surrounded by Daryl, Maggie, Kelly, who arms herself with Daryl's dropped crossbow , Cole, Kim , Elijah, and another Warden. Maggie demands answers from the Attacker who merely disarms himself and tauntingly tells Maggie that "" Pope marked you,"" before committing suicide by blowing himself up with a grenade as everyone else takes cover. Maggie is then able to find Hershel hiding out in a tree. The group spends the night in the shipping containers again with Elijah giving Kelly some food and a fist bump. Maggie thanks Kelly for helping Elijah, telling Kelly that he's been through a lot. Kelly tells Maggie that they all have and talks with her new friend about her sister, admitting that Connie is older and Kelly had come as a surprise to their parents. As their parents were too tired to raise Kelly by that point, Connie always kept an eye on her. Even when Connie had her own life, she shared it with her sister and tried to take care of Kelly. Kelly recalls that Maggie had a sister too and she's able to tell that Maggie was the oldest. Just like Connie, Maggie seems like she's been in charge of and protecting people her whole life. Maggie hopes that she'll get to meet Connie some day, and Kelly promises that she will. Kelly leaves as Daryl comes in to talk to Maggie, deciding that the group will stay in the area for a few more days and make sure that the Attacker was alone, before taking the long way back to Alexandria to make sure that nothing follows them home. A few days later, the group returns to Alexandria which has been severely damaged by the Whisperers and the residents are working on rebuilding it. Carol greets them and explains that the Whisperers had left them a parting gift of a damaged protective wall, buildings and destroyed crops. Regardless, Maggie decides to have her group stay and make Alexandria their new home. With the Hilltop destroyed, Kelly is one of the former residents to make Alexandria her new home as well. Kelly is part of a group consisting of Daryl, Elijah, Maggie, Carol, Alden, Rosita, Lydia, Gabriel, Jerry, Gage, Roy, and Magna who raid the abandoned Fort Connors military base for food supplies. She and the other women are lowered by rope into a hangar where they carefully navigate the room filled with lurkers and dead bodies. Kelly, Magna, and Maggie pick a locked door and find food supplies in another room. Back in the hangar when lurkers start waking up, she and Magna quickly gather the last of the supplies and help take out the awakened walkers. She manages to escape the hangar in time with the other women and the scavenged food. After the mission, Kelly returns to Alexandria with her fellow survivors. Standing guard on Alexandria 's walls, Magna aims to shoot down one of the vultures with her bow. Before she can attempt it, she is startled by the arrival of Kelly and Carol . Before she can run off, Magna stops Kelly and asks about her missing her shift with Magna. Kelly says that something came up, but promises to do her next shift with Magna. Magna gently asks if Kelly wants to talk about ""it,"" but Kelly brushes her off. In the woods, Carol, Magna, and Kelly stumble upon Rosita picking mushrooms. Rosita is keeping herself busy while Gabriel's on a mission, so she gladly joins Carol and the rest in their attempt to retrieve horses. When they finally find one, they try several times to carefully to sneak up on it, but fail, as the horse gets spooked before they can lasso them. Catching up with Carol, Rosita confides in her that she's been having dreams about Abraham recently. In her dreams, Abraham tries to tell Rosita something important, but just as he's about to, he gets shot in the head. Rosita used to be disturbed by this dream, but now believes it to be a message for them, although she doesn't know what Abraham is trying to say. Magna, meanwhile, tells Kelly that she read that if horses let you touch their ear, it means they trust you. Kelly asks if Magna thinks they'll catch them, but Magna isn't sure, since horses are wild creatures. Carol and her companions continue their search, until they discover the mutilated bodies of several horses. Kelly is distraught by the sight, while Magna comforts her. In spite of this, Carol wishes to continue the search. Rosita protests that they can continue tomorrow, but Carol is adamant. Noticing her distress, Magna comforts Carol with a hug, convincing her to call off the search. On their way back, Kelly assures Carol they'll get them next time. Rosita, however, hears hoofbeats and realizes they still have a chance to catch the horses. In a clearing, they see five horses galloping. Rosita notes the horses are running towards the dairy farm , which has paddocks where they can contain them. At the farm, they successfully trap the horses, but have yet to catch them, until Kelly insists that they drop the lassos. She thinks the horses aren't running and, in fact, want to come home. Carol manages to calm a horse down enough that it allows the women to pet it. Carol and her group arrive back to Alexandria with the horses in tow, much to the joy of other Alexandrians. While they tie down the rest, Carol proceeds to lead one horse away. Magna catches up with Carol, wishing to talk. Magna requests that Carol stop giving Kelly false hope. Carol is confused, but Magna knows Carol doesn't think Connie is alive, but can't accept what it means if she isn't. Carol thinks that Magna, being Connie's family, would want to know either way, but Magna replies that she just wants her family to heal. While she is sorry for what Carol is going through, Magna nonetheless asks her to stop what she's doing, as she is just making it harder for Kelly. Carol leads the horse to the stables and gets it to lie down. After calming it, she slaughters the horse for food. Later that day, Alexandrians feast on horsemeat. The children are reluctant to eat it, but Hershel assures them it isn't that bad, or better than spiders at least. Outside, Rosita takes Coco to see the horses, while Carol washes the horse blood off her hands. Magna and Kelly eat together, until Carol arrives to take Kelly out on another run, much to Magna's dismay. After discovering that Connie is in fact still alive, Kelly sets out on her own without letting anyone know to find her sister. Following the directions given by Keith , Kelly manages to find Connie's camp, but it is abandoned with Connie and Virgil 's belongings left behind. From one of Connie's notebooks, Kelly learns that her sister was trapped for days traveling with the herd and that she is with a man who had known Michonne . Continuing on, Kelly falls off of her horse, but she is found by Magna , Carol and Rosita . Kelly shows them her findings, including the fact that something seems to be hunting Connie and Virgil and the others join Kelly in her search. At night, the group reaches a fork in the road and Kelly leads them down the path that she believes that Connie most likely took. Kelly arrives outside of the Ferals' House just in time to use her slingshot to kill two of the Ferals , saving the lives of her sister and Virgil. Connie and Kelly share a tearful reunion before the group is forced to depart for Alexandria as a massive storm sets in. When a storm blows down part of the Alexandria wall and sets a fire at the windmill, Connie insists upon joining Carol 's team to put out the fire over Kelly's objections. Finally, seeing that she can't talk her sister out of helping, Kelly joins Connie and Carol. Kelly will appear in this episode. Daryl and Carol chat with Kelly and Connie , who is working as a reporter for the Commonwealth newspaper. Connie and Kelly try to speak with Tyler at the hospital where he's being held, but a soldier is guarding Tyler's room. Mercer closes the door in their faces. Connie and Kelly show up for a military ride-along for a newspaper story. They are directed into a wagon by the logistics officer while Mercer hops into a military truck. Mercer catches up with Connie and Kelly, and asks if Connie got everything she needed for her ride-along story. At home, Kelly tries to cheer up Connie, who is unhappy about having to write a puff piece about Mercer. Connie finds a note that someone slipped under the door. It's a list of names, with Tyler's name at the bottom. Connie , Kelly, and Rosita meet with Eugene at his apartment. Rosita tells Connie that Sebastian has been sending civilians on deadly missions to get him cash. Connie shows them a list of names that an anonymous source left at her door. They spot the name of April , the woman who was trapped in the safe room where they got Sebastian's cash. Connie says they need access to Pamela 's files in order to unearth more evidence. Eugene says he might know someone. At the Commonwealth, Connie , Kelly, Magna , Eugene, and Max are in a room reviewing the files Max retrieved. They try to figure out what is truly going on behind the scenes and plan to have Connie write an article exposing the Miltons. Connie plans on writing about Sebastian's heist and pin it on Pamela. Someone knocks at the door; everyone scrambles to hide the papers, but Magna stops them and reveals it's Ezekiel , who she invited to help. The all look at each other and agree that they have to do this for the good of everyone. Back in the Commonwealth, protests outside of Pamela 's office are in full swing, with dozens of residents demanding justice for the Miltons' crimes following Connie 's article naming the people who have died for Sebastian 's heist, such as April Martens , and those who have mysteriously gone missing, such as Tyler Davis . Connie, Kelly, Ezekiel , Magna , and Rosita join in the protests, while keeping an eye on the impact their work on exposing the truth is having. While Ezekiel voices a desire to be ready to help the citizens of the community in case things ""go sideways"", Magna brings up the need for them to have ""options."" Kelly asks if she intends to leave. Magna denies the prospect, saying that the people of the Commonwealth still need their help, but that it's only a matter of time before things get worse. Rosita assures them that a decision does not have to be made yet, or until Daryl, Aaron, and the others return. At night, despite the curfew going on, many residents attend a memorial service for April in Union Square. Connie, Kelly, and Magna arrive, as well as Henderson and many troopers. With a megaphone, Henderson tells everyone they are in violation of curfew and the herd is getting close. He tells everyone to go to their homes immediately, and while some leave, many decide to stay, including April's parents. Kelly will appear in this episode. Kelly is on board the prisoner bus with the other captives, with a bag over her head and given a sedative injection. On the Commonwealth bus, Ezekiel wakes up and removes his hood, groaning in pain as someone bangs on the side of the bus. The other prisoners, amongst them Negan , Annie , Kelly, and Theresa , follow suit. Ezekiel makes sure that everyone is alright, and Kelly confirms that she's unharmed. Annie notices that one of the trucks is missing and Negan notices that there's no sign of Gabriel, Maggie or Rosita either. Kelly reports that the soldiers are unloading a bunch of stuff off of the trucks, but she can't see the kids. Annie tells the other two that she was in and out of consciousness and that they had stopped for a few minutes during which time there had been a crash. Annie guesses that it was their missing friends which Negan admits fits, stating that they likely bailed, but stops himself from bringing up the worst-case scenario. The Warden boards the bus and greets the prisoners, telling them that today is the first day of a new beginning. The world works when everyone knows their place and the prisoners' place is at the bottom. All of the resources that the Commonwealth uses to bring the old world back into the new and sustain it all starts at places like this. The Warden suggests that they should take comfort in knowing that good people will benefit from their labor there which the Warden calls their redemption and salvation. The Warden promises that everyone's children are safe and being tended to and that they will get to see them again if they play by the rules. However, they need to work as one to be able to do that and the Warden announces that nobody has a name anymore as they have no need for them. The Warden won't tell them his name and they are forbidden to address each other by their own names. The Warden directs several prisoners to exit at the rear, including Annie. After sharing a look, Negan allows his wife to leave, but he promises to get his family out of this situation. As Annie exits, the Warden explains that the selected prisoners are being transported to another site while the rest of them will work at their current location until the railroad tracks are clear. The Warden orders everyone to follow him out of the bus, but Negan hesitates, worried about his wife's safety as the selected prisoners are driven off in another direction. The Warden promises that, while the work is hard, they will be protected by the Commonwealth. The Warden suggests that although they have been ""delivered from the paradise of the Commonwealth, take solace in knowing that it's better being here than it is being out there, in the wastelands."" The prisoners are set to work on clearing boxcar wreckage from the area. Kelly approaches Ezekiel as they work on clearing the tracks and tells him that there's only three guards and they should run and make a break for the trees. However, Ezekiel orders her not to do anything and to stop talking and keep working. Negan approaches one of the soldiers and asks about his wife, but the soldier whacks him in the face with a nightstick. The soldier tells Negan that the prisoners only stop to eat and sleep which Negan acknowledges. Two Commonwealth residents and an Alexandria resident make a run for the trees, but Ezekiel stops Kelly from going after them. The soldiers open fire, killing the three prisoners, and the soldier that assaulted Negan orders everyone else back to work. Ezekiel collects two bowls of slop and brings one to Kelly who is too depressed to eat after witnessing the prisoners die trying to escape. Negan secretly approaches Ezekiel who is pissed, having purposefully stayed away from Negan for years. Negan tells him that Ezekiel needs to shelve that shit, but Ezekiel lists Negan's crimes of melting peop le 's faces with irons, coercing women into marrying him and slaugh tering his people which Ezekiel hasn't forgotten and neither has anyone else. Negan admits that he hasn't forgotten either and that he probably deserves to be in a place like this for the things that he's done, and it fits him. However, it doesn't fit Ezekiel, the others, or Negan's wife and baby that is on the way. Reluctantly, Ezekiel asks where the soldiers took Annie, but Negan doesn't know although he needs to find Annie like he promised to do. Negan is coming to Ezekiel as a soon-to-be father and as a man who has led people. Negan and Ezekiel have got to put their troubles with each other aside and work together for everyone's sakes. Ezekiel asks what Negan has in mind and Negan tells him that he knows the Warden's playbook of using fear as a weapon, causing Ezekiel to ask if Negan wants to scare people into an uprising. Negan points out that that only works if you're the one holding the gun and fear won't work. However, hope will which is Ezekiel's thing rather than Negan's. Looking at Kelly, Ezekiel sadly states that this place thrives on separating people, and it is already breaking them down. They have to unite people, but they need a spark that reaches into their hearts and wakes them up and Ezekiel doesn't know how to do that here when they can barely even talk to each other. ""I can get you your spark,"" promises Negan. ""But when I do... you need to know that I doubt that I'll be getting out of here with you."" Ezekiel is confused by this statement, but they are ordered to get back to work before Negan can explain himself. Ezekiel agrees that he's with Negan for now as they return to work. At night, the Warden orders everyone to pack it in and load up. As the prisoners begin to board the transports, the prisoners that were killed earlier and reanimate and are quickly put down by a soldier. The Commonwealth convoy arrives at Outpost 22, leaving Ezekiel, Negan and Kelly shocked as they recognize it: a renamed and Commonwealth-occupied Alexandria . At the railroad tracks just outside of Alexandria , the Commonwealth prisoners work under the supervision of the Warden and his soldiers . Negan and Kelly observe the patterns of their captors with Kelly communicating her observations to Magna in sign language. Working with Ezekiel , Princess recognizes the missing Tyler Davis amongst the other prisoners from their brief imprisonment in the rail yard before he later took Max hostage and then mysteriously vanished . While Princess doesn't like Tyler, she knows that he's ballsy and that might be useful to them. As Negan gets a drink, Magna discreetly reports what Kelly had told him about the locations of the soldiers which Negan sketches out. Ezekiel approaches Negan and asks for the map, but Negan spots Annie nearby and, ignoring Ezekiel, approaches Roberts and offers to pick up a couple of extra shifts so that his wife can have her workload loosened. Negan appeals to Roberts personally who appears to consider it before they are interrupted by Sanborn . After being told that Negan is mouthing off, Sanborn decides that they need to show him his place and hits Negan with the butt of his rifle . Negan attacks Sanborn, but he is knocked to the ground by Roberts and kicked in the gut. Seeing her husband's predicament, Annie rushes in to intervene and shoved to the ground by Sanborn and is dragged away with him after a brief scuffle as Roberts keeps Negan from intervening at gunpoint. Hidden in the bushes nearby, a worried Daryl and Carol observe these proceedings. As the prisoners lay in their bunks that night, Sanborn and several other soldiers burst in, yelling for everyone to get outside immediately. The prisoners are all led to the windmill where the soldiers shine spotlights on them and the Warden, standing in front of Ezekiel and looking at him, announces that there's a traitor in their midst, someone who thinks that he's above the rules. Roberts and another soldier lead out Negan who has admitted to spearheading a rebellion , although any co-conspirators will be given the benefit of the doubt as the Warden trusts that they were not acting of their own free will. As such, only Negan will be punished, but they all need to see and remember. Annie breaks free and runs towards her husband, sobbing, but she is restrained, and Negan reassures his wife that it's alright. The Warden has Negan put on his knees in front of the windmill to be executed by a firing squad while the prisoners murmur to themselves about how they knew that Negan couldn't be trusted and was a liar and Annie pleads for her husband's life to no avail. However, before the Warden can give the order to fire, he notices Negan smirking and, unwilling to let Negan martyr himself, grabs Annie and adds her to the execution. Negan desperately pleads for the Warden to leave Annie alone and take only him, but the sadistic man is determined to make Negan feel this punishment. Ezekiel is conflicted watching this while Negan pleads with Roberts, who has a family, not to do this, causing a moment of hesitation before he proceeds. Unwilling to allow Negan to be executed, Ezekiel moves in between the firing squad and Negan and Annie, standing in their way. A number of the other prisoners quickly follow Ezekiel's lead, including Magna, Kelly, Princess, Tyler, and Nabila , creating a human wall between the soldiers and Negan and Annie. The Warden admits that he admires their bravery, but he nevertheless orders his men to shoot them all. Noticing most of the soldiers hesitating at being ordered to murder so many people, Ezekiel pleads with them that ""you don't have to do this! This world is broken, but we don't have to be."" Realizing that Ezekiel is right, Roberts lowers his gun and turns to the rest of the soldiers who follow his lead. Roberts turns his gun on the Warden, but Sanborn aims at him in return, causing Roberts to shoot him dead. The Warden grabs Kelly and tries to escape by using her as a hostage as Roberts and the prisoners try to stop him. However, Daryl and Connie come up from behind the Warden and Daryl stabs the Warden in the back, incapacitating him and retaking Alexandria from the Commonwealth. Negan prepares to kill the Warden with a rock, but he's stopped by Rosita . Rosita demands to know where her daughter is, but the Warden refuses to answer. Seeing Sanborn reanimate, Rosita grabs him and holds the walker over the Warden's face, once again demanding to know where her daughter is. With a smile, the Warden sadistically tells Rosita that she will lose everything, and Rosita furiously shoves the zombified Sanborn into the Warden's face which Sanborn begins devouring, killing the Warden. Rosita walks away, leaving Sanborn to eat the Warden as her friends, the soldiers and former prisoners watch in shock and horror at the brutal death. In a reclaimed Alexandria , the Coalition recover their various weapons from a large crate full of weapons confiscated by the Commonwealth . In front of the windmill, Rosita passes the corpses of Sanborn and the Warden , grabbing an extra clip for her gun off of Sanborn's belt. Gabriel asks Tyler Davis if there's anything that he knows that can help them find the missing children and Tyler reveals that, when he was a soldier, kids without parents would end up at the Commonwealth Children's Home . However, Tyler doesn't know where it is, so he goes to get the location from the captured Commonwealth soldiers at Gabriel's request. Rosita impatiently calls for the Coalition soldiers and freed prisoners to board the Commonwealth's transport bus. Princess asks Magna if anyone actually knows how to drive a train, but Magna reassures her that one of the prisoners apparently used to be an engineer before they board the bus, with Kelly, Connie , Adrienne and Dianne amongst those joining them. On the Commonwealth's train, Princess works on getting the train's long-range radio working with the help of Tyler who mans the antenna. Tyler notes that it's weird that the two of them are ending up in a place like this again and apologizes for his previous actions. Princess thanks him for it, but she doesn't have time for Tyler's apologies as she's trying to get in contact with the guy who can help them. As Tyler lifts the antenna through the roof, Connie, through Kelly, tells Tyler that she's happy that they finally found him. Kelly explains that they've been looking for Tyler since the night of Pamela's party. Magna sympathetically tells Tyler that society had thrown him away and he was desperate and mad, something that Magna can relate to. Tyler expresses remorse for hurting people in his efforts to get Pamela to hear him, knowing that he shouldn't have done a lot of things. Connie reassures Tyler that he can fix his mistakes and that, while Pamela might not have listened to Tyler, soon the people of the Commonwealth will. Outside of the tunnel entrance, four Commonwealth soldiers patrol while the Coalition forces hide nearby. Negan tells the others that they are sitting ducks and Mercer isn't coming and they can't wait for him. Carol agrees that it's time for a new plan, but Princess is sure that Mercer is gonna show up. Daryl states that they're running out of time and Carol decides to head around and try to find another way to slip in. Maggie suggests that they could take the four guards, but Rosita warns her that if those guards go missing, the clock is going to start ticking on them. Judith draws the others attention as one of the guards notices something and starts heading their way. However, Lieutenant Rose calls in with orders from Mercer for the guards to report to the East Gate immediately to deal with the incoming herd. Lieutenant Rose confirms that that includes Tunnel H and he reassures the soldiers that the tunnel is locked, and they've got it covered on the other end. Complying with his orders, the guards move out. Breaking the lock on the door, the group makes their way into the tunnel. A gunfight erupts between Pamela's forces and the Coalition with Rosita desperately trying to get the doors open. One Alexandria resident crawls towards a hiding Connie, Kelly, Magna and Dianne, but he is shot in the head and killed by one of Pamela's men before he can reach them. As the gunfight continues, Pamela herself emerges and grabs a gun from one of her men who is killed by the Coalition. Pamela takes aim at Maggie, but Judith notices and shoves Maggie out of the way just in time, saving her life. Instead, Pamela accidentally shoots Judith, seriously wounding the young girl. Daryl desperately attends to Judith as Pamela watches in horror and the others increase their fire, killing a few more of Pamela's men. Yelling that ""you did this,"" Pamela retreats to her office. Looking for a way out, Daryl spots a fire extinguisher near Ezekiel and signals him to throw it. Grabbing Rick's Colt Python from Judith, Daryl shoots the fire extinguisher, creating a smokescreen. In Union Square, Yumiko and Max observe the heavily guarded doors to Union Station from across the street. Hearing twigs snapping, Yumiko spots a hooded Eugene sneaking around a train car, armed with Brooks' rifle and she tells Max that they are going to go around. Inside, under cover of the smokescreen, Daryl and the others manage to break the chains sealing a side door. As a trooper approaches the doors, Eugene ambushes him and knocks the man out with the butt of his rifle. Magna finally breaks through the doors, and everyone is reunited with Eugene, Yumiko and Max before quickly making their escape. The Coalition races through the streets towards the hospital with Daryl carrying the unconscious Judith. Commonwealth vehicles drive up and block their path in multiple directions, forcing them to fall back. Carol realizes that the soldiers aren't following them as they begin to erect barricades in the streets. Loudly yelling and firing their guns in the air, Commonwealth soldiers lead the herd in their direction before closing the barricades, penning the herd and the Coalition in. Spotting a walker climbing over something, a shocked Negan asks ""what the fuck?"" As walkers close in from multiple directions, Luke and Jules emerge from the herd, causing Kelly to nearly shoot them before Connie stops her sister. Fleeing down a side street, Carol spots an alley near part of the herd and everyone attacks the walkers, clearing a path for Daryl to flee down the alley towards the hospital with Judith. Waking up for a moment, Judith calls out ""daddy?"" and witnesses her friends and loved ones struggling to hold back the herd before passing out again. In the streets, the Coalition desperately fights off the herd as they try to escape from the walkers swarming around them, those armed with guns shooting the undead while the rest stab at them with knives, including Max . However, Jules misses the head of one walker, instead stabbing it in the shoulder. The walker bites Jules in the arm and Luke rushes to his girlfriend's aid, stabbing the walker in the head and yelling for help as he supports Jules. However, walkers swarm the couple from behind with one tackling Luke to the ground and biting him in the leg as Jules is dragged down and devoured. Seeing Luke's predicament, Connie shoots the walker in the head and Luke is dragged to safety by Kelly and Yumiko , yelling in desperation for his girlfriend as Jules is devoured, beyond the ability of any of her friends to try to save her. Shooting at a smaller group of walkers coming down an alleyway, Carol orders her friends to follow her down it and everyone flees as the herd overruns the streets. At the hospital , a bandaged and bruised Daryl regains consciousness in a bed with Carol at his side and Magna's group nearby desperately trying to save Luke's life, having amputated his bitten leg. Near death from the bite and blood loss, Luke has his friends remove a harmonica that he's kept from his pocket and Yumiko promises him that they'll keep the music alive for him. With his last words, Luke asks everyone to promise him, and they all do so. Luke dies in his friends' arms as they all sob at losing him. Taking a knife from Kelly, Magna stabs Luke in the head to prevent him from reanimating and the group sobs over his corpse. Watching the others' grief, a determined Daryl decides to give Judith a blood transfusion, explaining that he's a universal donor and that Merle had used to make him sell his blood when he was a kid as a way of making money. Carol helps Daryl set up the transfusion as they watch the others cover Luke's body in a sheet. Hearing loud noise and shouting, Carol and the others leave to sweep the hospital for walkers and to make sure that the others are okay while Daryl remains with Judith. After walkers breach the hospital, Daryl begins wheeling Judith's stretcher out, but stops after seeing walkers pounding on the glass at the front doors of the hospital. Disconnecting the blood transfusion, Daryl barricades Judith in the room and rushes to help in the lobby where walkers drag Adrienne outside and devour her while the group barricades the doors again. Looking at the numerous walkers outside of the windows, Carol and Daryl shocked to see a variant walker breaking the glass with a brick while Connie spots more walkers coming down the hallway from the other direction. The variant breaks through the glass and is immediately stabbed in the head by Carol, but more walkers break in from the other side and drag a man outside and devour him. With walkers converging from the three sides, the group attempts to fight them off, only to have more walkers break through the barricaded door as well. Racing down a clear hallway, the group grabs Judith's stretcher while Magna radios the others to warn them that the hospital has been breached and they're leaving out the back. The group races through the hospital towards an exit as walkers close in on them from multiple directions. At night, outside of a loading dock, Mercer observes a crowd of desperate Commonwealth residents demanding to be let into the Estates. Mercer reassures Maggie that they will be able to move soon while Aaron tells Ezekiel that he saw people on the higher floors and rooftops begging for help, but he wanted to make sure that Lydia was safe first. Ezekiel reassures his friend that he did the right thing. Hearing screams in the distance, both men are determined to do more, but they need to take care of Judith first. Lieutenant Rose arrives in another truck and reports to Mercer that they're all set: everyone is in the back and there's no one to check. The doctors have set up a safe house, but they have to hurry. Mercer calls for everyone to go, stating that they need to get Judith to Tomi . Everyone boards the truck with Princess , Max and Dianne pushing Judith's stretcher. At the safe house, suddenly, there's shouts outside and two gunshots. Looking outside, Mercer sees a man trying to climb the wall, only to be shot by Commonwealth soldiers on Pamela's orders. Mercer tells the others that the soldiers are shooting anyone that climbs the gates and grabs a gun, unwilling to just stand by as people are dying. Mercer informs the Coalition members that the truck is gassed up with enough reserves in the rear to get them home. Mercer and his men can sneak them out the back as Mercer believes that this isn't their fight or their people. ""Yes, they are. And so are you,"" states Ezekiel. Addressing the others, Ezekiel tells them that ""you may not think this place is worth saving, and I get that, given how they treated us. But it's worth it to me. The people are worth it, and I'm not gonna allow them to fall without a fight. Not today. I'm with you. Who else?"" Aaron immediately agrees, stating that they can do more than just save themselves and they need to. Following Ezekiel's lead, everyone agrees to fight to save the Commonwealth. At the gates of the Estates, the crowd desperately begs Pamela to be let in, amongst them Mr. Martens , Mrs. Martens and Mei . On a balcony, Maggie lines up her shot on Pamela, but Negan tells her to hold on as Mercer and his loyalist forces move in, ordering Colonel Vickers and her men to lower their weapons. Pamela orders Vickers to arrest them, but the Coalition forces join Mercer's troops from another angle, creating a standoff. Pamela accuses Mercer of being a traitor, but Mercer states that she's the true traitor and lists Pamela's crimes: disappearing hundreds of citizens, leading the dead to their doorstep, shooting a child and now leaving thousands to die. The banging on the gates grows more frantic as the herd begins to approach the Estates, meaning that the people will die if they're not let inside. Gabriel moves towards the gates despite Vickers orders to stop. Gabriel announces that they're opening the gate and letting everyone inside, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him. Vickers threatens to shoot him, but Carol warns her that they will fire back if she does. Pamela orders her men to shoot Gabriel as he reaches the gates and one of them points a gun at his head. Suddenly, Daryl yells for them to stop. ""What the hell you doing?"" Daryl demands. ""We all deserve better than this. You built this place to be like the old world. That was the fuckin' problem."" Pamela states that if she opens the gates, the dead will get in too, not just the living. Daryl tells her that if she doesn't, Pamela will lose everything anyway. ""We got one enemy. We ain't the walking dead."" Realizing that Daryl is right, Vickers orders everyone to lower their weapons and give Gabriel the key to the gates. Everyone stands down and Vickers defers to Mercer's command who places Pamela under arrest for high crimes against the people of the Commonwealth. As everyone rushes to help let the people in, Maggie informs Negan that Pamela is getting arrested and Negan tells her that prison is a fate worse than death for someone like Pamela, causing Maggie to relent in shooting her. The crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in Alexandria and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified Lance Hornsby , Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of suicide . Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rife, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back. With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates. Using Pamela's record player, the song ""Cult of Personality"" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth. In Alexandria, everyone enjoys a celebration and feast, joined by Mercer, Max and Tomi. Judith gives Dog some of her food and Yumiko raises a toast to Luke. Looking out the window, Daryl sees Negan walking away and the two men exchange a smile and a nod, parting on good terms. Yumiko turns to Magna, telling her ""same"" and Magna kisses her, the two women resuming their romantic relationship. Sitting down, Rosita smiles as she watches the celebration before becoming somber. Noticing Rosita's somber mood, Gabriel joins her, and Rosita tells him that she just wants to remember this perfect moment. In a whisper, Rosita reveals her bite and impending death to Gabriel. Noticing Rosita's behavior and crying, Judith realizes that something's wrong with her and becomes upset, apparently deducing the truth. A year later, Eugene visits a memorial plaque for those lost in the walker invasion bearing Luke, Jules, Rosita, and Marissa Berot 's names and lays down flowers for his lost friends before pressing a kiss to Rosita's name. Eugene joins Max, who is now his wife, and takes their daughter Rosie from her and puts Rosie in her stroller. Ezekiel, now the governor of the Commonwealth with Mercer as his deputy governor, gives a speech attended by Eugene, Max, Princess, Daryl Judith, Kelly, Connie, Magna and Yumiko amongst many others, the latter two now happily married to each other. When Ezekiel introduces Mercer as his deputy governor, Princess loudly cheers for her boyfriend, much to the amusement of Ezekiel, Mercer and the crowd.","This list shows the victims Kelly has killed: The Attacker (Caused) Luke Abrams (Caused, alongside Yumiko , Magna , and Connie ) At least 16 unnamed Whisperers (3 Alongside Aaron , 12 Alongside Daryl , Carol , Jerry , Magna , Luke , Lydia , Marco , and Jules ) 3 unnamed U.S. Military soldiers (Zombified) 2 unnamed feral survivors 1 wild boar Numerous counts of zombies","For a more in-depth look at Kelly's relationships, read here: Kelly (TV Series)/Relationships",,"For more images of Kelly, please visit Kelly (TV Series)/Gallery .","Kelly's Comic Series counterpart is male, however she is female in the show.
