,,,"Oscar is a brave man and trusted individual within the community. He is shown to be willing to risk his life for his people, such as fighting against the 
Saviors
 and leaving the fair to protect the community from the 
Whisperers
.",Nothing is known about Oscar's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, Oscar joined a community called the 
Hilltop Colony
 where he became one of the supply runners.
Oscar is out on patrol with three other residents. Oscar's group briefly stops on the road to Hilltop's gates and Oscar replies to 
Maggie
's comment about 
Gregory
's first time dealing with walkers, stating that Gregory has told them he dealt with them before. He smirks before he and his group proceeds up the road to town.
Oscar is among the 
Militia
 to listen to the leaders' speeches before they launch their assault on the 
Sanctuary
. Before the attack, he listens on to Gregory's attempt to dissuade the Hilltoppers from attacking the Saviors but ignore his demands. After successfully ambushing the 
Saviors
' headquarters, he and the others leave in their vehicles so the incoming horde may swarm the factory.
Oscar is among the Hilltoppers to sneak into the satellite outpost that has been re-occupied by the Saviors in order to take it over. He gets into position as the Hilltoppers prepare to assault the unsuspecting Saviors. Inside, he and 
Dianne
 are with a group of Hilltoppers and 
Kingdommers
 pinned in a hallway as Saviors shoot from a distance. Oscar comments that they've lost touch with one of the groups. He is unable to answer 
Tara
 when she asks about 
Morgan
. After a lengthy gunfight, Oscar and his allies are able to gain the upper hand as the Saviors call a retreat. Before 
Alden
, 
Jared
, and the other Saviors can flee, they are captured by Oscar and the rest of the militia.
Oscar is among the Militia to bring the Saviors back to the Hilltop. He and the rest of the Militia help protect the Saviors from oncoming walkers during the travel.
Oscar walks around with 
Kevin
 as they help with improving the town's defenses. He witnesses the arrival of the 
Alexandrians
 and the revelation that 
Carl
 has died. Later, Oscar, along with 
Jerry
, 
Scott
, and Dianne, accompanies Maggie to the makeshift prison and listens on as Maggie declares the Saviors will be let out for a few minutes a day in pairs and under the close watch of the guards.
Oscar helps Dianne bring the Savior prisoners out onto the balcony as Maggie addresses 
Simon
 on the radio. After the Saviors open fire, he helps usher everyone inside the Barrington House. He survives the attack on the Hilltop and walks around the hilltop with 
Nabila
. He also survives the subsequent outbreak that leaves several more dead. He is part of a group consisting of Maggie, 
Jesus
, Dianne, 
Eduardo
, and 
Kal
 doing a sweep of the Hilltop grounds when they find Alden and 
Siddiq
. Alden alerts the group that several Saviors defected and are trying to close the gates to protect the community from incoming walkers. Oscar and the others then go to assist the Saviors in barricading the gates.
Oscar accompanies 
Rick
 and the rest of the militia to fight the Saviors in the final battle. After most of the Saviors are wiped out due to 
Eugene
's faulty bullets, Oscar and the others fight the surviving Saviors until they surrender. He watches on as 
Negan
 is defeated and captured while Rick addresses the crowd, declaring peace among all communities. Afterwards, Oscar returns home to the Hilltop.
Six years after Rick's assumed death, Oscar started working in the Hilltop's fields and informs Tara about the ongoing farming operations and the crops.
When Daryl and the search group return to Hilltop, Oscar looks in sadness at Jesus' body. He then listens as Tammy tells Tara that the Hilltop will now look to her for leadership, reminding her that includes getting justice for Jesus. A while later, Oscar assists Jesus' funeral and watches in sadness as the other residents hammer nails in the coffin.
Oscar is part of Tara's group in charge of clearing a tree from their path to the Kingdom to ensure the roads are cleared for Alden's convoy carrying the food and trade goods for the fair. Upon finding a downed tree, Oscar remains alert and checks the surrounding area. He then helps chop the tree into pieces to clear the road.
Later that day, a small herd of walkers approaches the group. They get in position and remind themselves to watch for 
the Whisperers
. Suddenly, 
the Highwaymen
 ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara after helping to take down the herd. They then escort them to the Kingdom, having accepted 
Carol
's deal. Upon arriving at the Kingdom, Oscar helps unload the trade goods and interacts with the welcoming Kingdommers.
Oscar watches from the crowd as 
Ezekiel
 declares they've finally accomplished Rick, Carl, and Jesus' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
""Let the fair of a new beginning begin!""
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds.
Later that day, Oscar and a group prepare to leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. He then fist bumps Tara goodbye. In the woods, Oscar and the rest encounter 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and 
D.J.
 and find one of Hilltop's carts overturned. The group decides to split up, with Oscar going to the Hilltop.
The next day, Oscar listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news about the fate of the missing fair attendees, tells them how brave the victims were in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.
Some months after the blizzard, Oscar is among the coalition members drafted into the militia that was formed in response to the Whisperer threat. He and the other militia conduct a training exercise on the 
Oceanside
 beach. As Ezekiel and Jerry methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Oscar and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat.
They are successful and return to Oceanside to rest, eat, and socialize with the Oceansiders. That night, Oscar helps put out the fire that was ignited in the woods in Whisperer territory after a satellite from outer space crashes.
Oscar returns to Hilltop with the hunting group from the woods and is asked by a concerned 
Connie
 about 
Kelly
's whereabouts. He informs that she volunteered to stay back and she would return later.
Oscar attends an emergency meeting in the Barrington House with the leaders of Hilltop and Alexandria and other concerned residents. He listens as the others discuss what to do in the face of the impending Whisperer threat. After it is decided that they evacuate the children and make a stand at Hilltop, he helps prepare for the battle against the Whisperers. He joins several dozen soldiers and militia on the frontlines and helps kill as many zombies as he can along the barbed wire fences. After getting the call to retreat, he and the others flee back towards the gates but are quickly stopped in their tracks as fire arrows ignite the walls and ground around them.
Oscar is among the Hilltop refugees to evacuate to the abandoned hospital being referred to as ""
the tower
"". He later opens a gate on the hospital grounds for 
Carol
 and 
Kelly
.
Oscar and Marco were out away from the hospital preparing the music wagon to lure the herd away when the Whisperers arrived and swarmed the hospital. That night, Daryl, Kelly, Carol, Luke, Jules, Magna, Jerry, and Lydia eventually reach the music wagon and deliver the needed equipment to play the music. With the parts assembled, the music is turned on and Oscar escorts the wagon alongside his fellow survivors, providing protection from incoming threats. However, many Whisperers swarm the wagon and are able to destroy it, forcing the survivors to flee. Unfortunately, Oscar has a knife thrown into his chest and quickly dies.","Killed By
