,,,Nothing is known about Aphid's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, Aphid somehow came into contact with a group named ""the Wolves"" which he subsequently joined upon where he marked his own forehead with the letter ""W"". Aphid aided his group in killing other survivors around the area to take their supplies or to make them turn so they could serve as a trap. They would also carve the letter ""W"" into their victims' foreheads. Aphid is among the Wolves who invade the Alexandria Safe Zone . He manages to critically wound Erin after slashing her stomach when suddenly he is killed by Carol , who then steals his clothing and writes a ""W"" on her head with blood to use as a disguise and easily kill the other Wolves.","Killed By Carol Peletier After Aphid cuts Erin, Carol sneaks up behind him and stabs him in the back of this neck and then in the side of his head with her knife.","This list shows the victims Aphid has killed: Noah's Brother 2 (Possibly, Caused or Direct, Alive) Noah's Mother (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Noah's Brother 1 (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Erin (Caused) Dinesh (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Stacy (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Michael (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Natalie Miller (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Bobby (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Samantha (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Charlyne (Possibly, Caused or Direct) Jeffery (Possibly, Caused or Direct, Alive) Richards (Possibly, Caused or Direct, Alive) Numerous unnamed Shirewilt Estates residents (Possibly, Caused and/or Direct) A few camp residents (Possibly, Caused and/or Direct, Alive) Numerous counts of zombies and unnamed people",,,"The actor who portrays Aphid, Duke Jackson , also portrays two other characters, a Terminus survivor who was killed in "" No Sanctuary "" in Season 5, and an unnamed Savior who appears in Season 6, 7, and 8.
