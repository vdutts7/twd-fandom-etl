Overview
[
]


Daryl is both physically and mentally strong. He is often surly and very resourceful, but his compassion and loyalty towards the people he cares about are second-to-none. Despite his hardened personality, he is not without a softer, more emotional side. He is often volatile, but still significantly more level-headed than his older brother, Merle Dixon. Usually distant, Daryl is often shown to be caring and selfless under extreme circumstances. Without being asked, he attempts to find the lost Sophia Peletier on multiple occasions, one of which nearly cost him his life. He also takes the initiative to go back to find 
Andrea
 when she gets separated from the group.

In 
Season 1
, Daryl is portrayed as a southern specialist tracker who constantly lives in the shadow of his older brother, Merle. Despite his hostility and distant behavior, he is a member of the team for a multitude of reasons - some of which being his hunting and tracking skills, his creativity in dealing with 
walkers
, and his uncanny knack for surviving some of the worst possible conditions. 

In 
Season 2
, Daryl becomes more complacent and cooperative within the group, showing signs of respect and affection to the members he's growing closer to through mutual respect. He also begins to develop a special bond with fellow survivor Carol, helping her find her lost daughter, Sophia. Daryl begins to realize his older brother's way isn't the only way to do things, taking on more responsibility for his actions and the group itself. Having been an outsider for most of his life, he is now starting to become a loyal member of the increasingly closely-bound team. However, after Sophia's death, he reverts to his original hostility and becomes emotionally detached from the group. With the help of Carol and the rest of the group, he is involved in some issues (eg. helping Rick and 
Shane
 handle 
Randall
) and seems to care about the 
farm
 and his shelter. On the night the farm is destroyed, he escapes with Carol and while she tries to persuade him to leave with her, Daryl, with a sense of respect for Rick, seems to be committed to keep the group safe.

In 
Season 3
, Daryl proves to be invaluable, helping Rick and the rest of the group to clear the 
prison
 from the walkers so they can turn it into their new home. Moreover, he helps defend the prison after Rick's psychological collapse due to 
Lori
's death, takes care of 
Judith
, and also demonstrates his leadership capabilities by keeping the team united. The group has now become a large family, for which he is willing to kill or die for. Not surprisingly, when he learns that 
Glenn
 and 
Maggie
 are detained by 
The Governor
 at 
Woodbury
, Daryl is one of the first members of the group to voluntarily go with Rick and penetrate the town to get their people back. However, Daryl ends up imprisoned there and after many hardships manages to escape with his brother, Merle. Daryl is then forced to choose between his old family and his new family. He finally decides to go with his brother. Daryl and Merle meet a family that is threatened by walkers. Daryl shows his altruistic mentality, leaping in to save them while Merle ignores them and then tries to plunder their car. However, Daryl prevents him, deciding to leave his brother behind and return to the prison. Merle then decides to follows him as he has nowhere to go. Merle eventually sacrifices himself while trying to kill the Governor. Daryl later finds that Merle has turned, and for the first time Daryl shows his conflicting feelings. He is understandably devastated by his brother's death, yet he unleashes frustration and anger he's felt for his brother since childhood on Merle's body.

In 
Season 4
, his role in the group is even more important. He has become a member of the 
Prison Council
, being responsible for the prison administration and is also one of the key members of the group. However, the security of the prison does not last long, as the Governor leads a new team that manages to eventually destroy the team's shelter. After the Governor's assault, Daryl and Beth are separated from the others and Daryl firmly believes that they all died during the assault. He feels guilty about not being able to protect Rick, 
Hershel
 and the rest of the group. However, everything changes when Daryl meets Rick, 
Michonne
, and 
Carl
 once again just before they all head to 
Terminus
. Rick's relationship with Daryl has become so strong that Rick considers him a brother.

In 
Season 5
, the group is trapped in Terminus. They all face great risk, but an explosion gives them the opportunity to escape. Thanks to Carol, the group is able to reunite. During the fifth season, Daryl and Carol's bond gets stronger, having been separated from each other for a long time. However, Daryl hasn't forgotten what happened to Beth. At the same time, the group meets a new survivor, 
Father Gabriel
. At one point, Daryl sees the car he had seen the night Beth was lost and follows it with Carol. In their effort to find Beth, they meet 
Noah
, who informs the pair that there are people kept as hostages and Beth, who had helped him escape, was one of them. Throughout the previous seasons, Daryl has begun to mature. He prevents Carol from killing Noah, saying "He's just a kid". Later in the season, the 
group
 who captured Beth, captures Carol as well after being hit by one of the hospital's scavenging cars. Daryl returns to Father Gabriel's 
church
 with his main motivation being revenge. The whole group is preparing to get back its members. Unfortunately, only Carol manages to come back as Beth ends up with a bullet on her head. Daryl responds with swift vengeance on 
Dawn Lerner
. After a long search for a shelter, the group finds a 
barn
 and temporarily stays there, but a new and seemingly suspicious survivor named 
Aaron
 approaches them and suggests they follow him. After a lot of discussion, they finally join Aaron and end up in 
Alexandria
. At first, Daryl cannot adapt to Alexandria's life and is isolated. However, soon, due to his hunting and tracking skills, he is offered to be Alexandria's new recruiter along with Aaron.

In Season 6, he uses an newly acquired RPG to destroy a group of Saviors, saving Abraham and Sasha. During a supply/scavenging run, they meet up with Jesus, a survivor from another camp called the Hilltop Colony which is run by Gregory. In order to open up talks of trading between the Hilltop and Alexandria, Rick and the group agree to attack the Saviors to ensure the safety of the Hilltop. The group sets out to attack what turns out to be just one outpost of many. Though they win that particular battle, it starts a full out war with the remaining Saviors and their leader, Negan. Later in the season, Daryl ends up injured and hostage to Dwight. The events of the sixth season culminate in the last episode, wherein the group is circumvented in getting Maggie to Hilltop for medical attention for a sudden complication with her pregnancy. The season finale is left open as to who is on the receiving end of Negan's punishment.

In Season 7, after the deaths of Abraham and Glenn, Daryl is seen for the first time truly broken. Alexandria ends up working for 
Negan
 and for the first half of the seventh season, Daryl is imprisoned in The Sanctuary. Through the hardships and psychological torture, Daryl still manages to maintain his sanity. With the help of Dwight's wife Shelly, Daryl escapes the daily torture at the Sanctuary, and after killing a Savior named Fat Joey, is reunited with his group at Hilltop. The group's mission becomes recruitment of other communities to help add numbers to their fight against the Saviors. Hilltop and Alexandria commit fully to the war, however the Kingdom, The Scavengers and Seaside are both wary to join them. At the Sanctuary, Dwight's allegiance shifts now that his wife has escaped. Dwight arrives at Alexandria with an offer of intelligence on The Saviors and his help in defeating them. Still upset at Dwight for killing Denise, he slams him against the wall, but Dwight insists he's on their side and offers to work with them, saying his only reason left for staying with the Saviors, Sherry, is now gone, he begrudgingly stands down.

In Season 8, Daryl is the key character for the success of the plan to trap The Saviors inside of the Sanctuary. Daryl, along with Rick separate from the rest in order to get some weapons from a Savior outpost. However, it soon becomes clear that Daryl, seething over Glenn's death and the torture he suffered at the hands of the Saviors while imprisoned by them, is determined to kill them all, not caring what their reason for following Negan's orders may be. This is shown when he kills 
Morales
 despite their history prior to his joining the Saviors stating that the history in question no longer matters, murders an unarmed 
Todd
 despite the fact that Todd was just a worker and that Rick had just promised Todd they would spare him if he gave them the information he'd agreed to give them and drives a bus through the Sanctuary wall in a determined attempt to allow walkers they'd lured to the Sanctuary to get in and kill everyone inside, so blind with hate that he was unconcerned that many of the people the walkers subsequently killed were innocent prisoners and workers. Upon Carl's death, he reminds the teenager that he saved the entire Alexandria community with his actions. Still stunned from Carl's death, Daryl and the group reluctantly decide to "trust" Dwight, but he still says that he will kill him when the war is over. Finally, Daryl participates in the final battle against The Saviors. Then, he leads Dwight into a forest, where Dwight waits to be killed. However, Daryl, finally accepting that Dwight had been forced to follow Negan's orders against his will, drives him away and encourages him to look for his wife Sherry, warning that he will kill him if he returns.

In Season 9, eighteen months after the victory of the communities against the Saviors, Daryl has become the leader of the Sanctuary, which seems to not entirely please him. Indeed, he expresses to Rick his desire to do what he is good at; being out there, but Rick doesn't agree. The relationship between the two men is not at its best, as they have different beliefs and it seems clear when Daryl is eager to help Maggie, who wants to kill Negan, contrary to Rick's "belief". Later, Daryl tries to prevent Rick from stopping Maggie. They have a brief fight, but in the end, they reconcile. Then, when a horde of walkers is preparing to attack the communities, Daryl and Rick split up with the latter presumably dead. After a six year time jump, everything has changed and Daryl now lives alone with a dog. Daryl later assists Jesus and Aaron in looking for a missing Eugene. In their effort to find him, they notice that something strange is going on with the horde of walkers. When they finally find Eugene they are confronted by 
The Whisperers
.

In "
Omega
", Daryl shows a knowledge of how abusive parents work and sympathy for 
Lydia
 when he realizes that the girl has been abused. Upon confronting Daryl, 
Henry
 realizes that Daryl himself is likely a victim of abuse, explaining his knowledge and sympathies. Henry tells Daryl that 
"sometimes you act like the kind of guy that slams people against walls, but I don't think that's it,"
 implying that Daryl was the one who was abused rather than being an abuser. Henry suggests that Daryl's perspective could help to show Lydia that Daryl could be the one person to show Lydia that there's nothing to be afraid of with Daryl suggesting that Henry could as well.

In Season 10, Daryl continues helping to lead the fight against the Whisperers as well as struggling to act as a father figure towards Lydia. Despite his bad past with 
Negan
, Daryl comes to his defense and even votes not to kill him, trusting the word of both Negan and Lydia about what had actually happened during the altercation with 
Margo
, 
Gage
 and 
Alfred
. However, Daryl becomes filled with rage when 
Magna
 and 
Connie
, whom Daryl had developed a close friendship bordering on possibly romantic, disappear after the collapse of 
Alpha's Cave
. With Carol's reckless actions having caused it, this develops a rift between the two formerly close friends and Daryl recklessly attacks Alpha, nearly getting himself killed in the process. Following the end of the war and the defeat of the Whisperers, Daryl remains distant and bitter towards Carol, particularly after returning to 
Leah's Cabin
 and finding 
Leah
 to be still missing.

In Season 11, Daryl has lost some of his bitter rage and willingly works with Negan during the mission to take down 
the Reapers
. Daryl's surprise reunion with Leah allows him to infiltrate the group with Daryl trying to both take them down and protect both his former lover and his adopted family, something that Daryl and Leah share in common. Although the mission ends with Leah being forced on the run, Daryl is finally reunited with Connie which softens his attitude once more. With both Rick and Michonne gone, Daryl takes up the role of parent towards 
Judith
 and 
R.J.
, something that he struggles with at times, although Daryl makes for a good father overall. Daryl also seems to have mended his relationship with Carol after Connie's return and moving to the 
Commonwealth
, the two even planning to have lunch together at one point. Working as a soldier in the 
Commonwealth Army
, Daryl maintains his loyalty to his friends and family, even threatening 
Lance Hornsby
 at gunpoint when he steps out of line. Commonwealth General 
Michael Mercer
, who has to deal with corruption in his forces, is shown to have a great deal of respect and trust in Daryl despite them having a short relationship. During this period, while Daryl wears his armor often, he also discards it in situations where he's around his friends, such as the standoff at the Hilltop and working with Gabriel and Aaron despite them being with a number of other Commonwealth soldiers. When Leah resurfaces, Daryl kills his former lover to protect 
Maggie
 and tells her that he feels he owes it to Glenn to protect her in the stead of Daryl's deceased friend.

When the Coalition and the Commonwealth go their separate ways, Daryl argues with Judith who wants to stay and help, revealing in the process that Daryl does too, but to him, keeping Judith and R.J. safe is more important which means taking them and leaving instead of staying. However, while Daryl is protective over them, he is not overprotective, allowing Judith to join him in putting down a small 
herd
 of walkers that are attacking and killing innocent people.

After the Commonwealth is saved and having learned that Rick is still alive, Daryl decides to go looking for his best friend with the encouragement on Carol and Judith, the latter of whom encourages Daryl to find his own happy ending.

After being transported to 
France
 by the 
Power of the Living
, Daryl at first focuses on returning home to America, wanting to keep his promise to Judith. However, things change for Daryl after he meets 
Isabelle
 and 
Laurent
 who need his help. Daryl finds himself drawn to Isabelle while becoming a father figure to Laurent who has never had a father in his life before. Daryl helps to bring them to 
Paris
 and the 
Union of Hope
, building the start of a family with Isabelle and Laurent which scares him. When Daryl gets the chance to return home, he takes it, but is clearly conflicted. However, Laurent following him and falling into danger causes Daryl to change his plans.

Staying in France for the time being, Daryl takes up a leadership role in the fight against 
Genet
 and her forces and trains Laurent in how to defend himself, putting him at odds with 
Losang
's more pacifist approach. Isabelle tells Daryl that she thinks that he simply does what's necessary, even when no one else is willing to do it, 
"especially then, in fact,"
 but now that they've made it to 
the Nest
, Laurent needs something else from Daryl. However, Daryl isn't sure that he can ever be happy at the Nest and constantly thinks of the people that he had left behind in America.

Daryl Dixon (TV Universe Games)#Survival Instinct


Daryl grew up in the Appalachian Mountains of Northern Georgia alongside his older brother 
Merle
, under the roof of their neglectful redneck parents, their father, an abusive alcoholic alongside their chain-smoker mother. Merle was the only inspirational figure he had during his youth and thus inherited his backward views on society, however, due to his older brother's service in juvenile detentions, he became frequently absent from Daryl's life and thus he was reluctantly forced to fend for himself, upon where he developed a hard-boiled survivalist mindset.
[2]


At a young age, the brothers lost their mother in a house fire which had been caused by a cigarette while she was asleep or presumably drunk.
[3]
 Some point after this event Daryl found himself lost in the woods for nine days during where he was forced to consume wild berries and utilize poison oak as a substitute for toilet paper. Eventually, he managed to find his way back home. Upon arrival however, he discovered that his father had not noticed his absence and thus Daryl simply walked through the back door and made himself a sandwich.
[4]


Over the course of several years, the brothers were mentally and physically abused by their father, which eventually caused Merle to abandon the family and join the military, subsequently leaving Daryl in the process which resulted in severe scars located on his back, this abuse however was unknown to Merle.
[5]
 Following an altercation with his father, Daryl moved out from his birth home and eventually reconnected with Merle and thus simply followed his brother's lead upon where they entered into a drifter lifestyle, where the pair utilized their survival instincts, upon where Daryl grew into a proficient hunter and tracker, hunting for food and dealing in contraband.
[6]


At one point, the pair resided in Merle's drug supplier's house where the trio watched TV and by noon had become intoxicated, a discussion turned violent where the dealer punched his older brother, where Daryl retaliated by savagely beating the man. However, the dealer then threatened to shoot Daryl, a large argument ensued, which ended with the dealer punching Daryl in the gut, causing him to vomit. Merle and the dealer laughed the incident off. Following this near-death experience, Daryl came to view himself as an unimportant individual who held no value or purpose in life.

"
Tell It to the Frogs
"


After 
Merle Dixon
 was abandoned on a rooftop in Atlanta during a supply run, Daryl is mentioned by 
Morales
, who notes that he may be the only one who'll be upset at Merle being left behind. He is mentioned again as being away hunting by 
Dale Horvath
, who also mentions that he will become volatile. When a walker appears nearby the camp eating the corpse of a deer, Daryl appears out of the woods, complaining that he was on the trail of the deer that he had shot with his crossbow. He finds it partially eaten by a walker, surrounded by the rest of his group. After Dale decapitates the walker, the head continues to growl only to be permanently silenced by a bolt from Daryl's crossbow.

At the camp, Daryl arrives calling for his brother, but he is informed by 
Rick Grimes
 and the others that Merle was insane and a threat back in the city, so he was handcuffed to a roof and left behind. This prompts Daryl to snap. He tries to attack Rick, but 
Shane
 restrained him as 
T-Dog
 reassures Daryl that Merle is okay, as he had locked the roof door shut before fleeing the city. Daryl then demands the location of the building so he can go there and rescue his brother. Rick offers to go with him. T-Dog and 
Glenn Rhee
 also offer to go. Daryl is later seen telling the others to hurry up, so they can rescue Merle quickly. The four men get in a truck and depart.

Daryl and the others arrive at Atlanta. Rick says that he also came back to retrieve the 
bag of guns
 that he dropped when he first came into the overrun city. Daryl silently kills all the walkers in the way with his crossbow, and when they reach the rooftop of the department store, they find that the only thing remaining is the handcuffs, a hacksaw, and Merle's hand. Daryl, shocked and angered at what he sees, breaks down and starts crying.



"
Vatos
"


Daryl, after seeing what he saw, points his crossbow at T-Dog, blaming him for his brother's disappearance, but gives in after Rick holds a gun to his head. Daryl wraps Merle's hand in a cloth and puts it in Glenn's backpack. They begin to follow the blood trail left by Merle. The trail leads them into a room with two dead walkers where all but Daryl are astonished that Merle was able to kill both with just one hand. In the same room they find an iron steak weight covered in burnt skin which Merle used to cauterize his stump. Later they find a window with a hole in it, possibly meaning Merle has escaped. When Daryl decides to go search for Merle on the streets, T-Dog reminds him that they need to get the bag of guns first. Glenn makes a plan to get the guns: Daryl must accompany Glenn to the store's alley, while Rick and T-Dog wait in an alley two blocks away.

The plan gets underway, and Glenn is able to retrieve the guns, but another survivor, 
Miguel
, runs into Daryl from the back of the alley, to which Daryl rationally asks him about his brother and begins to beat him with his crossbow. Miguel screams, alerting Rick, T-Dog, and two other survivors: 
Jorge
 and 
Felipe
. Jorge and Felipe arrive first and beat up Daryl, until they spot Glenn with the bag of guns. They tackle Glenn, who drops the guns, and Rick's hat, which gives Daryl enough time to aim his crossbow and fire an arrow into Felipe's behind. A car arrives at the scene. Jorge and Felipe grab Glenn and get into the car, leaving Miguel behind. When Rick and T-Dog arrive, they see Daryl closing a gate to prevent the walkers from crowding the alley. Daryl throws Miguel against the wall, in which Rick restrains him.

Later, while they are trying to get information about Glenn's whereabouts, Daryl threatens Miguel and shows him Merle's hand, bluffing and threatening that it was an enemy of his. They head to the "Vatos"' hangout, where Rick tries to negotiate into giving Miguel to them and getting Glenn back, but their leader, 
Guillermo
, also wants the bag of guns. They return to the building and Daryl, T-Dog, and Rick decide to go back and threaten the Vatos. They return and then enter the Vatos' hideout threatening bloodshed, but an elderly woman enters the room and they find out that the gang are actually nurses taking care of elderly people. After solving the problem, that was just a misunderstanding, Rick gives the gang half of the guns inside the bag. Daryl, Rick, T-Dog and Glenn are returning, Daryl comments how he was against giving away half of the guns. On the way back, they notice that the truck they used to get to Atlanta was stolen, they assume that Merle stole the truck to go back to the camp and get revenge.

Daryl and his crew return to the camp on foot, and notice that walkers had infiltrated the camp, where they were attacking the survivors, killing/infecting quite a few of them. Despite the high number of casualties, Daryl, and the rest, are able to kill all of the invading walkers, thanks to the weapons inside the bag of guns.



"
Wildfire
"


The next morning, Daryl helps in the cleanup of the walker carcasses and the bodies of the fallen campers. He and Morales drag the body of a man towards the bonfire but Glenn stops them, demanding that the dead be buried properly. Daryl hesitates but eventually agrees, he ultimately curses everyone, saying that they deserved what they got after leaving Merle behind. As Daryl impales each corpse with a pickaxe to prevent reanimation, 
Carol
 stops him as he is about to hit 
Ed Peletier
, saying that she should impale her husband's head. When the survivors find out that 
Jim
 has been bitten, the group unites to discuss what to do with him, Daryl immediately grabs the pickaxe to take Jim out, but is stopped by Rick, who points his gun do Daryl's head, prompting him to drop the pickaxe and walk away.

After the funeral of the fallen camp survivors, the group decides to move to the 
Center for Disease Control
 in hopes of finding a cure and saving Jim's life. They part ways with Morales' family, who decided to go look for their relatives, and Daryl heads with the group to the CDC. Along the way, the RV breaks down, so Shane and T-Dog scout out the gas station ahead for parts, while a dying Jim is perched against a tree as everyone says their goodbye to him. Daryl glares at Jim and after a moment gives him a nod, before turning back to his car. As the night comes, Daryl and the survivors reach the CDC complex to find it locked, walkers start to close in on the group, but Rick refuses to leave as he says that the security camera is moving.

"
What Lies Ahead
"


During their excursion to 
Fort Benning
, the group is forced to hide from a 
herd
 of walkers, Daryl saves T-Dog from one of them, then covers himself and T-Dog up with corpses to fool the rest of the walkers. When Carol's daughter 
Sophia
 goes missing in the aftermath, Rick enlists Daryl's expert tracking abilities to help find her. During the search, they dissect a walker to see if it had eaten Sophia. When the trail runs cold, they are forced to return to the others empty-handed.



"
Bloodletting
"


On their way back, Lori hears a gunshot and is suspicious about it as Rick or Shane wouldn't risk wasting or alerting walkers to kill a single walker. He reassures Carol that they are going to find Sophia and she is going to be fine. When Andrea is facing a walker and 
Maggie Greene
 comes in by horse for 
Lori
, Daryl rushes with the rest of the group as Lori jumps on the horse. He says that they don't even know her or who she is so how could they trust her, but in the end with nothing really to stop her, he lets her go to the 
Greene family farm
. Later, the group decides what to do as they need to head to the farm and meet up with Rick but don't want to risk Sophia coming back to an empty highway. Daryl offers to stay one more day and set up signs to tell her just in case, after Dale mentions that T-Dog is in bad shape and needs medical attention. Daryl goes to Merle's stash and gets him some "first class" antibiotics for his blood infection.



"
Save the Last One
"


Daryl wakes up at night hearing the sound of Carol sobbing over Sophia. Daryl grabs his crossbow and decides to go out and look for Sophia and is joined by Andrea who could not sleep either.

While in the woods, Daryl assures 
Andrea
 that Sophia is going to be fine. Andrea protests and tells him that Sophia is only twelve years old and is not yet capable to survive on her own with no food or weapons. To reassure Andrea, he tells her a story about his childhood when he was lost in the mountains living off of berries and cleaning himself with poison oak. No one ever knew he was gone, not even Merle because he was in a juvenile detention center, and when he finally made it back, he walked into the kitchen and made himself a sandwich. The story lightens the mood and Andrea laughs.

Daryl and Andrea continue on down a path and hear something that they suspect to be Sophia but are mistaken and arrive at a campsite where a man hanged himself and had turned into a walker. Daryl read the sign that the man wrote that said, "Got bit, fever hit, world gone to shit, might as well quit" that Daryl commented on saying that the guy was too stupid to shoot himself in the head. Daryl continues to describe the flesh that had been eaten off the man's legs by other walkers and Andrea pukes. Andrea then asks if he was planning on just leaving him hanging up there which Daryl replied that he wasn't doing any harm up there. Daryl asked Andrea if she still felt like dying and Andrea said she would answer for an arrow. After answering with a fairly confusing answer, Daryl shot the walker in the head and said it was a "waste of an arrow." They return home without Sophia.



"
Cherokee Rose
"


Daryl goes searching for Sophia again, alone this time, and finds a Cherokee Rose for Carol. He sets it on the counter beside her and explains that when the Native Americans were being relocated, many of their children died and went missing, and it was believed that the tears of the mothers made a Cherokee Rose bloom. He also stated he doubted the flower had grown for his brother, Merle, but instead for Carol's daughter, Sophia.



"
Chupacabra
"


The next day, Daryl and the rest of the group continue to search for Sophia. Daryl takes a horse and heads to search alone. While searching near a creek he discovers Sophia's doll. Shortly afterwards he falls off a cliff-side into a river when his horse is spooked by a snake. On the way down Daryl hits his head and impales himself on one of his arrows. He leaves it in and attempts to climb a steep cliff only to fall and lose consciousness. As he drifts in and out he hallucinates his brother Merle who mocks and taunts him, calling him a failure and telling him the others in the group just see him as a freak. Daryl awakes to see a walker gnawing on his boot and another one approaching. He kills the closest one with a branch and pulls the arrow out of his side to dispatch the second one. After bandaging his wound he once again attempts to climb up the cliff. On the way up he again hallucinates Merle who again mocks him, telling him nobody cared about him but his brother and that he should shoot Rick next time he saw him. Eventually Daryl makes it back to the farm, but due to his blood soaked appearance and limp, Andrea takes him for a walker and shoots him. The bullet grazes his left temple and Rick and Shane rush Daryl back to the house. His injuries are not mortal and Hershel bandages him up. Later, Carol brings him dinner and thanks him for doing so much to find her daughter, kissing him on the forehead to show someone does care about him.



"
Secrets
"


Daryl is seen recuperating from his injuries in a tent outside the farm house. Andrea gives him a book and attempts to apologize for accidentally shooting him, but Daryl brushes off her concern stating she was just trying to protect the group and that he did not blame her. As she left, he added, "You shoot me again you best pray I'm dead."



"
Pretty Much Dead Already
"


Daryl is first seen eating breakfast with the rest of the survivors; when Glenn tells them that the barn is full of walkers, Daryl sets his jaw.

Later, he walks to the stable and readies a saddle to go out looking for Sophia again, but as Carol sees he's still hurt from the arrow wound, she tries to stop him, telling him she doesn't want to lose him too. He throws the saddle to the floor, and, still in pain, walks away calling Carol a "stupid bitch." Shortly after he takes Carol to a pond where he apologizes and shows her another Cherokee rose that's blooming to restore her faith in finding her daughter. Much later, when Shane starts giving out the guns to the group, Daryl takes one quickly. As the group sees Rick and 
Hershel
 walk up to the barn with two walkers on long poles, he approaches them and keeps his gun aimed at the male until Shane shoots it and opens the barn doors. He quickly lines up with Shane, Glenn, T-Dog and Andrea and starts shooting the walkers. When zombified Sophia finally steps out of the barn, he catches a horrified and grief-stricken Carol to stop her from getting too close to her daughter.



"
Nebraska
"


Daryl is angered that Carol won't attend her own daughter's funeral but he still attends with all the other survivors. Lori decides that Daryl is the best choice to look for Rick, Hershel and Glenn, but he is still upset over the sacrifices he made in vain to collect Sophia and snaps, "I'm done lookin' for people."



"
Triggerfinger
"


Daryl tells Carol that Lori had asked him to find Hershel, but he had refused. He speculates that Lori went on her own to town. Back at the Greene Farm, Carol goes to check on Daryl, finding many dead squirrels and severed walker ears hanging on a clothes line. Daryl catches her and confronts her. After their argument Daryl walks away from Carol and she yells out that she will not let him push her away.



"
Judge, Jury, Executioner
"


In the farm's slaughter shed, Daryl beats a bound and whimpering 
Randall
 who cries out, "I've told you", to which Daryl replies "You've told me shit!" Randall says he barely knows the guys he was with so Daryl asks how many are in his group, but when he receives no reply, he draws his knife. Randall confesses that he was traveling with a group of about 30 men who never stayed anywhere for more than one night, but he doesn't know where they plan on going next. Continuing the interrogation, Daryl rips Randall's bandage off and sticks his knife into his wound. Randall quickly admits that the group is heavily armed with automatics but is insistent that he's not dangerous and is nothing like them. Randall tells a story of how one night, whilst scavenging, the men found a father with his two teenage daughters whom they proceeded to rape in front of their father for fun. Randall insists he didn't touch them but Daryl continues to beat him. Throughout the interrogation Randall begs and cries for it to stop, to no avail.

Daryl reports what he's found out to the rest of the group, explaining that if this gang "rolls through here, our boys are dead, and our women they're gonna... well, they're gonna wish they were". Carol asks what Daryl did; he replies that they "had a little chat". This leads Rick to declare Randall a threat, and that he must be killed, "You can't just decide on your own to take someone's life," 
Dale
 objects, begging Rick to give him time to talk to the group and find another way. Rick reluctantly agrees to give Dale the rest of the day, after a short bit of persuasion.

Later, Daryl can be seen inspecting bolts and placing them into his crossbows quiver as Dale approaches. "The whole point of me coming up here is to get away from you people" Daryl expresses, before Dale can speak. Daryl asks if Carol sent him but Dale explains that it's not only her that's concerned about him, or his new role in the group. "This group's broken, I'm better off fending for myself" Daryl says, stating he doesn't care what happens to Randall in reply to Dale asking where he stands. Dale asks Daryl to stand with him anyway, but Daryl won't because he believes his opinion won't matter and he knows that Rick only listens to Shane. He also mentions about how Shane killed 
Otis
 and how he didn't believe Shane's story because he came back with a dead man's gun, this leaves Dale shocked that Daryl seems disinterested at the fact Shane is a killer. Before walking off Daryl reiterates "The group's broken".

An upset Carl comes across Daryl's (Merle's) motorcycle and starts looking through its satchels, he finds a handgun and decides to take it.

At the meeting to decide Randall's fate, Dale pleads with the group to do what's right. Andrea eventually sides with him, but the others still want him dead, bar Carol, Maggie, Hershel, 
Patricia
, and Daryl who remain neutral. Despondent, Dale leaves the room. Putting a hand on Daryl's arm, he says "This group 
is
 broken."

Afterward, Rick, Shane, and Daryl walk a begging Randall to the barn. Shane says "This is all going to be over soon." and Randall suddenly realizes what is going on, which leaves him scared and begging even more. Rick asks him whether he wants to stand or kneel but when he doesn't answer Daryl forces him to the ground. Rick now asks if he has any final words to which Randall just continues begging for his life. As Rick raises his gun, Carl enters the barn. "Do it Dad, do it" he says. Shocked, Rick lowers his gun and orders Randall taken away which Daryl obliges. Shane then storms out of the barn.

When Dale's screams are heard, Daryl, who at the time is about to cut Randall with his knife, runs to the scene. Being the first to get there he sees the walker on top of Dale, tearing into his stomach. Daryl leaps at it tackling it off Dale, he rolls and stabs it in the head. He calls for help and tries to comfort Dale but his intestines are spilling out of his gut and he goes into shock, just as everyone else arrives. When Hershel finally gets down, he says that Dale can't be saved. A teary Andrea who is also comforting Dale begs Rick to help. Rick takes out his gun, but can't bring himself to shoot so Daryl takes the weapon and aims it at Dale's head. "Sorry brother," Daryl says and shoots Dale in the head out of mercy.



"
Better Angels
"


To the dismay of Shane, Rick now promotes Daryl as his new wing man. When Rick and Daryl prepare to leave, T-Dog is sent to get Randall. He discovers the barn empty, as a short time earlier, Shane had brought Randall into the forest informing him he is done with the Survivors and wants to join with the others. This is merely a ruse as Shane breaks Randall's neck, killing him. Before returning to the group, Shane pounds his own face into a nearby tree to make it seem as if Randall had injured him during an escape.

A thorough search of the farm shows no sign of Randall. Shane buries his gun upon returning, before he shouts to the group announcing that Randall escaped and is armed. Rick assembles Glenn and Daryl to go with him and Shane to track him down.

Glenn and Daryl come across the area of the forest where Randall was last seen. Daryl notices that the area shows signs of a struggle. As a walker appears, the two of them take cover behind some nearby trees. The walker turns out to be Randall and tries to attack them, but Glenn drives a knife into his head, killing him. Daryl conducts a brief examination of the body, only to find that it shows no sign of bites or scratches, and that his cause of death was his neck being broken. Daryl starts to wonder what is going on that could cause him to turn into a "walker".



"
Beside the Dying Fire
"


As the inhabitants of the farm notice the herd approaching, Daryl is asked by Lori to go and look for Carl. He puts his crossbow and pistol to good use, killing many of the walkers. Eventually he notices Carol surrounded and rescues her, fleeing the farm afterwards.

Later on, he and Carol meet up with everyone else on the highway. After everyone realizes Andrea is not with the group, Daryl volunteers to go back and find her but his attempt is thwarted by Rick, who says she's either dead or far away from the farm by that time. Later on, when Rick suggests they camp out on the road, Daryl brings up that Randall reanimated due to a broken neck and wasn't bitten. When Rick shares that Jenner told him everyone was infected, Daryl was at first skeptical but later accepted that Rick did the right thing by not telling everyone about it. That night around the campfire, Carol tries to persuade Daryl to separate and go off on their own; Daryl wants to stay. Carol then says that Daryl is a man of honor and that he should be leading them, not Rick. Daryl refuses, saying Rick has honor and that he trusts him.

At night, after Carol brings Daryl some food, she seems to be in discomfort, complaining that her shoulder hurts because of the kick-back of a rifle she was shooting, and that she's just not use to that rifle yet. Uncharacteristically, Daryl quickly tries to relieve her pain with a shoulder massage, but after only seconds and some nervous eye contact, Daryl stops and suggests they should return with the others. Carol points out that they just had a romantic moment and jokingly asks if he would be interested in screwing around. Daryl and Carol both laugh off the statement.

Rick consults Daryl about this decision and Daryl gives Rick a sign to not to trust the prisoners. They decide to let the prisoners leave the prison, since they don't want to live in the Cell Block B. T-Dog questions this action, Daryl expresses his opinion that he knew guys like Axel and Oscar and they are not psychos, even though, they should try their own luck on the road.

He bids farewell to a sick Sasha, and leaves with the team. While driving towards the hospital for the supply run, the group hears a voice over the car radio repeating the word "Sanctuary... Sanctuary...survive..." Daryl is distracted by it and hits a few walkers on the road. He stops the car, shocked at the massive herd of thousands of walkers between them and their destination. Daryl drives in reverse and runs over several more walkers, but the car eventually gets stuck, forcing them to ditch it. Daryl, Michonne and Bob make it out and hold their own, but Tyreese stays behind, seemingly in a stupor. Bob eventually snaps him out of it and Tyreese storms out of the car and in a rage, ferociously begins to kill the walkers that are quickly surrounding him, yelling at the others to go as he is swarmed. After running in the woods for a while, the group stops to rest, and notices movement in the bushes. Tyreese emerges, covered in walker guts and blood, but alive and unharmed. They keep moving as the walkers chase after them.



"
Indifference
"


Daryl continues with Tyreese, Michonne, and Bob on their mission to retrieve medicine from the veterinary college. While helping Daryl jump-start a van they found, Bob says that he almost started to run when Daryl found him because he was the last man standing in the first two groups he was with, and that he blames himself for Zach's death because of accidentally knocking over the liquor shelf and attracting the herd of walkers, to which Daryl tells him that it is "bullshit". After getting the medicine, the group is forced to jump outside onto the roof of a walkway where Bob almost loses his bag to a herd of walkers, but manages to retrieve it despite the protests of the others to let it go. Daryl discovers Bob's bag contains nothing but a bottle of liquor, but Bob has his hand on his holster when Daryl attempts to throw it away. Daryl disarms Bob and grabs him until Tyreese breaks it up, saying that Bob has made his own choice. Daryl says that they should have never let him join the prison group to begin with and threatens to beat Bob into the ground if he takes a sip of the liquor before the medicine is given to the sick members of the group.



"
Internment
"


Daryl appears near the end of the episode, returning with the supply search party to the prison. Next morning, Daryl is informed by Hershel to talk with Rick about Carol.



"
Too Far Gone
"


Daryl is first seen talking to Rick about Carol's banishment due to her killing Karen and 
David
, clearly upset and shocked at the decision. After calming down, he and Rick go to tell the news to Tyreese. When they arrive in the tombs, Tyreese shows them a dissected rat inside the prison, which he believes is the work of the same person who killed the two. Before they have a chance to say anything, the Governor's camp attacks and everyone able relocates outside.

Daryl is as shocked as everyone when he reveals Hershel and Michonne are his prisoners and demands Rick come down and negotiate, which he does. As Rick descends to the gates, Daryl discreetly arms everyone and lines up a rifle against the gates next to Carl. Carl suggests he take out the Governor with one shot, but Daryl tells him to let Rick handle it. However, Hershel is executed and war abruptly erupts. Daryl takes out several of the Governor's people and eventually destroys the tank with grenades, killing its operator 
Mitch
 with a crossbow to the chest. As the Prison falls, Beth came across Daryl and together, they left the prison to places unknown.



"
Inmates
"


Daryl and Beth appear deep in a forest fighting walkers. After killing numerous of them, the two run into a field and collapse, visibly exhausted. By nightfall, the two have made a campfire in the forest, and Beth convinces Daryl to go with her and look for any other survivors. The next morning, the two find small footprints. They follow them for a bit to a grape bush, where Daryl suggests the owners of the tracks picked up the pace. Beth says Daryl should have hope, to which Daryl replies "[Faith] sure as hell didn't so nothing for your father," upsetting Beth. The two find a plant with blood on it, and Daryl states that it is human blood. They continue down to railroad tracks, where they find a pile of dead bodies.



"
Still
"


Beth and Daryl make their way out of the woods and come across a destroyed car. walkers are heard coming from the trees and Daryl tells her to hide in the trunk. The next morning they get out, scavenge the car for anything useful and leave. Later, Daryl tries to shoot a squirrel with his crossbow, but it dodges at the last second and the arrow is destroyed when it hits a tree. He later kills, skins a rattlesnake and shares it with Beth. When Beth says she wants a drink, Daryl throws her a water bottle. She says that she wants some alcohol (due to her father not allowing it). Daryl ignores her and she goes off to find some on her own. After she lures several walkers away, Daryl finds her and brings her back to camp. Furious, Beth says that she wanted something to do and will find some alcohol, whether Daryl helps her or not.

They make their way to a country club and Daryl looks for supplies while Beth goes to find some alcohol. Daryl hears a scuffle going on and sees her stab a walker. She sarcastically thanks him for the help, but he said she "had it under control." He is seen taking money in several rooms; when Beth asks why, he doesn't respond. The two later find the bar as well as a bottle of Peach Schnapps. While she looks for a glass, Daryl grabs some darts and throws them at a picture of the country club presidents. He hears Beth crying and he smashes the bottle of Schnapps, saying that it won't do for a first drink.

Daryl leads Beth to a shack he found with Michonne and brings out some moonshine from the back. He says that the house reminds him of the one that he grew up in with his parents and Merle. He pours Beth a drink and after some hesitation, she drinks it and pours one for him. After awhile, she teaches Daryl the drinking game 'I never' but accidentally angers him, sending him into a rage and attracts a walker outside. After he haphazardly shoots several arrows at the walker, Beth stabs it in the head and the two have a fight. After Beth continues to belittle Daryl for his cold and distant outlook since they left the prison, he eventually breaks down and says everyone else is probably dead now because he stopped looking for the Governor with Michonne. He starts to cry, blaming himself for Hershel's death while Beth comforts him by hugging him from behind.

That night, Daryl finally reveals what he was doing before the outbreak; he was a drifter and a junkie who traveled from place to place with Merle. Never having to care or look out for anyone but himself or his brother, Daryl had to learn by himself and never had anything given to him like Beth did in her life. Beth acknowledges that she doesn't have the skills necessary to survive like he does and that out of them all, he will most likely be "the last man standing." Daryl disagrees, saying that she's changed as well. Beth then says they both should burn the building down; Daryl goes inside, saying they need more booze. After emptying all the jugs of moonshine, Daryl hands her a book of matches. She lights the wad of money Daryl took earlier and they light the shack on fire. They flip it off, and as they leave the burning shack, Daryl smiles.



"
Alone
"


About a week prior to the events of "30 Days Without an Accident", Daryl is seen, through a flashback, coming across with Glenn a wandering Bob Stookey. He asks Rick's three questions (How many walkers have you killed? How many people have you killed? Why?) before allowing Bob to accompany them back to the prison.

In the present, Daryl is first seen accompanying Beth as she uses his crossbow and practices her tracking skills, and she correctly deducts walker footprints and finds it feasting. Before she can silently kill it, she gets her foot caught in an animal trap and alerts the walker. Beth fires the crossbow, but it doesn't pierce the brain, and she is saved by Daryl. Daryl takes her via piggyback to a nearby funeral home, where they first pay their respects to a "beloved father" at his grave, which reminds her of Hershel, and she then holds Daryl's hand. At the funeral home, Daryl and Beth find that the home is in a clean condition and that the shelves are stocked with foods which have no dust, and Daryl determines that someone else is using the funeral home for themselves. Daryl is then questioned by Beth on why he stayed, and he implicates his reason being Beth herself. Daryl mistakes the ruckus at the funeral home's door for a stray dog that had approached him earlier, only to have a herd of walkers attempt to barge in. Daryl instructs Beth to run outside and meet him there, but she is kidnapped by an unknown party as Daryl sees their car driving off when he finally makes it out. Daryl gives chase after the vehicle, but eventually is forced to give up after he could no longer push through and sits down near the railroad tracks.

Joe
 and his 
group of marauders
 approach Daryl, who responds by punching Joe and aiming his crossbow at him. Joe says to Daryl if he kills him, his buddies will kill Daryl, saying it would be suicide, and asks Daryl why hurt himself when he can hurt other people. Daryl and Joe introduce themselves.



"
Us
"


Daryl is first seen in the woods aiming his crossbow at a rabbit. He fires at it at the exact time that 
Len
, one of Joe's group members, fires his bow and strikes the rabbit. Daryl says that he has been tracking the rabbit all morning and that it is his, but Len disregards this because "the rules of the hunt don't mean jack" and because he already "claimed" the rabbit. Len reasons that the loss of Beth is the cause of his poor mood, and begins to speak provocatively of her before Joe arrives out of nowhere to diffuse the situation. He asks Len if he claimed the rabbit, which he says he did, but Daryl does not relinquish the rabbit. Joe explains his rules and system of "claiming", but Daryl says that there are no rules anymore. Joe assures him that there are, and that's why he didn't kill him for his crossbow. Joe takes his hatchet and cuts the rabbit in half, giving one half to each man.

Later while on the tracks, Joe speaks to Daryl and asks him what the plan is. Daryl says that he will be sticking with the group for right now. Joe talks about his rules and says that, if you break them, you will be punished. He explains that when men like them follow the rules, the world becomes theirs. When they come across an old mechanic building, Joe whistles and orders them to stop, saying that they will be camping there for the evening. Daryl says that "there ain't no us" and Joe says, "You leaving right now?" When Daryl does not respond, Joe says, "Then sure seems like there's an us."

Later that night when things are quiet, Len claims that his half of the rabbit is missing and accuses Daryl of stealing it. Joe asks Daryl if he took the rabbit, but Daryl assures he didn't take anything. When Joe empties Daryl's bag, Len's half of the rabbit falls out. Daryl accuses Len of planting it in there when he went out to use the bathroom. Len is eager to teach Daryl a lesson for lying and stealing, but Joe turns and punches Len to the ground. Joe orders his men to "teach him all the way" for being a "lying sack of shit". The Claimers savagely beat Len. Joe tells Daryl that he saw him put the rabbit in the bag. Daryl asks him why he didn't stop him, and Joe says that he wanted to play that out; he let him. The next morning when they leave from the building to continue their walk, Daryl finds Len beaten horribly and with an arrow shot through his head. He is about to cover him with a sheet but decides against it and leaves him exposed.

On the tracks, Joe explains their mission to Daryl: They are heading to 
Terminus
 in the hope of finding the man who strangled their colleague 
Lou
 in the bathroom of a house in which they were staying some time ago. Unbeknownst to Daryl, this man is 
Rick Grimes
, who was staying in the house after the fall of the prison. Spotting some radishes in the ground, Daryl claims them and stoops down to collect them, seeming to have found his place in this group.



"
A
"


Daryl appears right after Joe and his group have ambushed Rick, Carl and Michonne on the road in the night. As Joe begins to count down from ten, to shoot Rick in the head, Daryl comes out, "stopping him at eight". Daryl looks as Joe and the rest have Rick and Michonne held at gunpoint and Dan having Carl caught inside the car. He reasons with them that the trio are "nice people", but Joe does not believe this and tells him that Rick killed their group mate 
Lou
 and thus that Daryl is lying. He orders Billy and Harley to beat Daryl to death. While Daryl is assaulted and Dan prepares to rape Carl, Rick becomes enraged and kills Joe, biting his jugular out of his neck. Michonne kills Tony by turning the gun pointed at her back on him and shooting him in the head. Daryl punches Harley and Michonne shoots him, and Daryl finishes his attackers by stomping Billy's head in. Daryl turns and watches as Rick disembowels Dan on the other side of the truck.

The next morning Daryl explains to Rick how he ended up in Joe's group. He says that he was with Beth for a short while after the prison fell until they got separated when a group of walkers attacked them and split them up. He also says that Joe and his group had only one "stupid" rule, but it worked. Rick assuages Daryl's fears that his interaction with the group had anything to do with the attack the night before and affirms that he is his brother.

As they continue their journey, they come across 
Terminus
 from the side of its fences. After scouting for a short while, Rick, Daryl, Michonne, and Carl climb inside from the back of the sanctuary's fences and sneak inside. They run to a nearby door and end up in a large spacious room, where a resident is doing a broadcast over a PA system repeating the words "Sanctuary for all" to all the survivors who can manage to hear them via radios. They are welcomed by man named 
Gareth
 who tells them to lower their weapons and frisks them. After the check, they are welcomed to Terminus and Gareth warns them to not do anything stupid while his brother 
Alex
 shows them around.

A woman, 
Mary
, offers them some food while they're shown around. Rick becomes suspicious as he spots someone donning the 
hitchhiker
's orange bag (which 
Glenn
 took with him from the prison), Glenn's riot gear (which he also retrieved), and Daryl's poncho (which 
Maggie
 was wearing upon entering Terminus). When Rick spots 
Hershel
's pocket watch dangling from Alex's pocket, he concludes something is up and grabs Alex and holds him at gunpoint. He demands where he got the pocketwatch, riot gear, and poncho. A gunfight ensues between Rick, Daryl, Michonne, and Carl and the Terminus people. The Terminus people force them through an alley while they are being fired at. They make it to the back fences but are cut off when Terminus people emerge from the bushes. Gareth arrives and orders them to go to the nearby boxcar in order of Ringleader (Rick), Archer (Daryl), Samurai (Michonne), and Kid (Carl). As they enter the boxcar, they are reunited with Glenn, Bob, Maggie, and Sasha and meet 
Abraham Ford
, 
Tara Chambler
, 
Rosita Espinosa
, and 
Eugene Porter
. As Daryl walks around the boxcar, Rick says the last line to be said in the season: "They're screwing with the wrong people".

No Sanctuary
"


Daryl and the others create makeshift weapons to fight off their captors, but the Terminus guards instead drop a flash-bang grenade into Boxcar A and drag Daryl, Rick, Bob, and Glenn out. They are taken to the slaughterhouse and lined up bending over a pig trough next to another four male survivors from another box car. One by one, the four survivors are brutally slaughtered over the pig trough. Before Glenn can be executed, an explosion distracts the guards which gives Rick an open window to break free and slaughter the guards. Rick lets Daryl, Bob, and Glenn free before the four discover that Terminus were planning to butcher them and use them as food. Rick orders them to not put down the guards and kill any Terminus member on sight.

After fighting through a horde of walkers invading Terminus as well as the Terminus residents without his crossbow, Daryl and the others make it back to Boxcar A and set the rest of the group free. The group manages to escape Terminus, hitting Gareth with a bullet in the process. As everyone regroups on the outskirts of Terminus where Rick buried his weapons, Carol re-appears, which causes a tearful Daryl to run over to her and embrace.



"
Strangers
"


Daryl travels with the group as they leave Terminus. Later that night, he's sitting with Carol. She tells him she doesn't want to talk about what happened and needs to forget it. They hear a noise in the woods, and Daryl stands up. After a while, he concludes it was nothing and they leave.

The next day, Daryl has hunted for squirrels and brings them back to the group. He tells Rick he saw no trail of who/what was making the noise in the night. They continue on until they hear someone screaming and rescue him; the man reveals himself to be Father 
Gabriel Stokes
. Daryl expresses his skepticism about him many times. The group arrives and decides to split up, hunting for supplies. Daryl travels with Carol and they collect some water. As they're on the road, Daryl tells her they get a chance to start over and "whatever happened, happened." They manage to find a car with a dead battery and a working emergency starter in the trunk, and Carol thinks it best if they leave it for emergencies. Daryl offers to carry some water, but Carol playfully refuses.

Daryl is later enjoying dinner with the others and is present when Abraham makes his speech and Rick accepts the idea to go to Washington, D.C.. He eventually goes to find Carol at the car once again and starts to bring her back when he spots the car with the white cross driving away. He and Carol immediately follow suit in the car.



"
Four Walls and a Roof
"


Daryl appears at the end of this episode after Michonne heard some rustling in some bushes, and in turns out that it was Daryl. Michonne is relieved and happy to see him and smiles, but it soon fades away as she asks where Carol is, but Daryl answers it by telling someone in the bushes that they can come out.



"
Consumed
"


Daryl and Carol are seen following the car believed to have taken Beth. They follow the car into the city, up until the car stops at an intersection. Discovering that the driver is a cop, the two question each other about the fact of who took Beth in the first place. As this is happening, a walker tries to get them but is blocked by the car window. Visually alerted, the cop gets back into the car. As the cop drives away, their car runs out of gas and stalls. This forces the two to kill several walkers that surround the car, before continuing to a building. As Daryl is trying to pry open a barricade on a window, Carol rushes towards an upcoming walker, but before killing the walker, the two notice a herd is coming. The two then crawl into the building and decide to stay for the night.

Carol takes the first watch as Daryl sleeps even though he offers to take first watch, but Carol insists to stay up. As Daryl sits on the bedside, the two talk about "starting all over". The conversation between the two ends by a rattling sound heard outside. Following the sound, the two discover two walkers, one being a child, trapped behind a glass door. Carol wants to kill the child, but Daryl stops her and insists that she doesn't have to.

When morning comes, Daryl kills the two walkers he and Carol found the previous night, and burns them as Carol joins him, thanking him for doing so.

The two then continue their journey on finding where Beth is believed to be. They burn a paper to lure the walkers blocking their way, before entering a parking lot and building. As they enter the building, they discovered a camp of walkers, and the two kill most of them, but not the ones that are trapped in the tents. The two then rest up in an office after crawling into the room from the gap in between the chained doors. Observing the scenery of the destroyed city from the window, Daryl sees a van with the white crosses on them stuck on a bridge. Daryl and Carol then decide to go check it out, but as they crawl out from the room, they encounter 
Noah
. While holding Carol's rifle, Noah asks Daryl to put down his crossbow at gun point. Daryl obeys what the boy asked, before killing the walkers that Noah freed from the tents to give him time to escape. The two kill the walkers, and Noah is still in sight, giving Carol a clear shot. Despite of what he has done, Daryl stops Carol from shooting him, saying that Noah is just a child. As Carol explains to him that regardless of his age, he could've killed them, could've killed Beth, and added that's why she did what she did at the prison to Karen and David, saying that she can not be one of those people who just stand there and do nothing.

Nevertheless, Daryl still disagrees with Carol. Despite not having any primary weapons, Carol and Daryl still go to where the van is that's believed to be related to the people who took Beth and her location. They search the van to find some clues to where the place is located but they find nothing. A herd of walkers then comes their way and Carol hints to Daryl that they have to fight through the herd. They try to but the walkers overwhelm them, forcing the two to go back into the van, which falls off the bridge and onto the ground below. The two survive the fall but Carol injures her shoulder when landing. The two then enter another building and rest up in one of the rooms. While in there, Carol tells Daryl about her past with Ed. The conversation is distracted by a sound they hear outside. As they walk towards the sound, they find a walker that's nailed to the wall by a bolt of Daryl's crossbow. Daryl kills the walker. Then they hear gunshots and they follow the sound and find Noah killing a walker. Then he gets hit by Daryl and eventually gets pinned down underneath a book shelf. A walker is seen trying to pry open the door that once barricaded by the book shelf. Seeing this as an opportunity to kill Noah without getting his hands dirty, Daryl tells Carol to leave him be. Carol disagrees and insists Daryl help her help him up.

Daryl leaves Carol to save Noah by herself. When the walker successfully pries open the door and tries to bite Noah, Daryl sends a bolt into the walker's skull, saving Noah's life and then helps Carol lift the bookshelf. After being saved, Noah mumbles about the folks at the hospital, whom are hunting him down. Hearing this, Daryl asks Noah whether or not he knows a blonde girl. Noah is shocked upon knowing that Daryl and Carol know Beth, before realizing the cops are just right outside the building. Fearing the cops will find them, Noah tells Daryl and Carol to run away with him. As the three are running away from the building, Noah trips and causes Daryl to lag behind. Carol leads the way but once she is outside, a car hits her. Witnessing this, Daryl tries to go to Carol, but is held back by Noah who tells him that he needs to let the people take her because regardless of how the place is, they have a doctor and Carol needs one. Daryl, overwhelmed by seeing Carol get taken, asks Noah about what is it gonna take to save Carol and Beth. Noah answers, "A lot. They've got guns and people." "So do we." Daryl replies back, hinting the people at the church.

The two then leave the city, using a truck they find. Daryl stares sharply to the road as the episode ends.

He asks to Tyreese how is she doing, to which Tyreese replies she is not 'there' yet. Daryl then leaves with the stockade of organ pipes, fortifying the entrance of the Church, using it, piercing the pipes to the ground, just like what they did to the Prison's entrance.

Daryl, Rick, Noah, Tyreese, and Sasha leave the church, heading towards Atlanta. Upon arriving to the hospital.

In a flashback, Daryl eats while Rick and Morgan talk. While outside Rick tells Daryl that Morgan told him all about the truck traps and the men he fought the W's on their foreheads. Rick states that they need to protect themselves and there is no need to go out and recruit people anymore. Daryl, however, disagrees with this but in the end follows Rick's lead. While at the meeting, Daryl listens to Rick's plan. While constructing the set up for the walkers at the quarry, Daryl tells Rick, hoping to change his mind, that going out and recruiting people is taking care of themselves, but ultimately says it's Rick's call. While getting everything set a few walkers came by. Rick wanted to let the new people take care of themselves, however, Morgan intervened. Meanwhile Rick, Daryl, and Morgan show up just in time before Carter shoots Eugene. Carter states that he's taking the community back from Rick and his people. Rick quickly disarms Carter and points the gun at his head. Rick threatens Carter and tells him that he has no idea who he's talking to. Carter tells Rick to just kill him as it was his idea and not Spencer, Tobin or Olivia's idea. Daryl silently tells Rick to give him the gun, saving Carter's life.

In the present, Daryl is at the quarry with the group who are going to help remove the herd of walkers trapped inside the quarry. When the truck trapping the walkers gives in, Daryl rushes along with the others to execute the plan on the spot. Daryl leads the horde of walkers through the designated zone in which Rick planned out. Later on, Sasha and Abraham meet up with Daryl to help him keep the horde on course. Daryl is last seen in this episode, along with Sasha and Abraham, leading the walkers down the designated path 20 miles out.



"
Thank You
"


After the horn is blown, over the walkie, Daryl asks Rick what's going on. Rick tells him that half of the quarry herd broke off and that they're moving towards Alexandria. Daryl offers to help, but Rick tells Daryl to stay the course and keep the rest of the herd moving along the road. However, Daryl tells Abraham and Sasha that he's leaving them to help defend Alexandria. Abraham and Sasha implore Daryl to stay until they reach the 20-mile marker as planned, but Daryl refuses and rides off on his bike. Later, Rick radios Daryl to inform him that the breakaway herd will soon be back on track. When Rick gets attacked by 
the Wolves
, the group that set up the trap at the shipping building, Daryl hears gunfire over the walkie and calls Rick's name, but gets no response. He races down the road, reluctantly rejoining Abraham and Sasha as the herd trails behind them.



"
Always Accountable
"


Daryl, Sasha and Abraham arrive at the 20-mile marker set for leading the herd away from Alexandria. As they pull away from the herd and begin the journey back to Alexandria, a group of gun-wielding assailants ambushes them in cars. As they flee, Daryl crashes on his bike and is separated from Sasha and Abraham. Daryl eludes his attackers and quietly walks his motorcycle through a burnt-out forest littered with charred walker bodies. He tries to radio Sasha and Abraham but gets no response. As he inspects a wound on his arm, he hears a noise nearby. He hides his bike under a pile of branches and finds two sisters, 
Tina
 and 
Sherry
, with their hands up, telling him they took what they deserved. Just then, 
a man
 knocks him out from behind.

As Daryl drifts in and out of consciousness, he sees his captors rummage through his supplies and put his crossbow in a bag. The man pegs Daryl as a soldier from an outpost – one of the men who originally attacked Daryl, Sasha and Abraham. The man, Dwight, wakes Daryl at gunpoint the next morning. Daryl insists he isn't who they think he is, but Dwight doesn't believe him. Daryl's captors march him through the woods. Dwight declares that they are not returning to the community they came from. "You feel you gotta kneel? Fair enough. We don't." Dwight tells Daryl. As they keep moving, Dwight lays out a plan to find "Patty" and then leave immediately. He describes how he and Sherry burned the entire forest with the walkers in it. He then explains that they joined up with a community, thinking naively that they would rebuild society together. Daryl argues that they should let him go, but Dwight refuses to listen, and holds him at gunpoint when Daryl suggests that they're making a mistake. Dwight angrily questions if Daryl possesses an immediate threat and demands to be told whether he should be killed. Daryl says no. They arrive at a gated parking lot full of walkers and start to panic. "Patty", Dwight says. "She's gone." Tina faints, and as they tend to her, Daryl grabs their duffel bag and runs back into the woods, evading gunfire from Dwight.

Safe in the woods, Daryl again tries to radio Sasha and Abraham without luck. He grabs his crossbow from the duffel to shoot a nearby walker. Afterwards, he looks down at the fallen contents of the duffel and sees a cooler filled with insulin: Tina's a diabetic. Daryl returns Tina's insulin and forces Dwight to hand over their gun as well as a wooden figurine that Dwight carved. They're interrupted by the arrival of men in a truck. 
Wade
, the leader, orders Dwight to return what he took – Tina and Sherry, who angrily reply that they're not going back. In response, the truck begins to plow through the forest, trying to flush them out. Daryl helps them find a hiding place further away, and gives their gun back to Dwight. He lures 
one of Wade's men
 into the path of a walker, which bites him. Wade hacks off the man's arm and calls off the search. Daryl's group comes across a burnt and melted greenhouse. Tina recognizes the two dead people encased in melted glass inside and lays flowers at their side. The corpses awaken and attack Tina, breaking through the glass and killing her. Daryl kills the walkers as Sherry breaks down and Dwight looks on distraught. Daryl and Dwight dig a grave for Tina.

Daryl asks him how many walkers he's killed, how many people, and why. Satisfied with Dwight's answers, Daryl invites them to come live in Alexandria, and Dwight acknowledges his offer, seemingly interested. Daryl brings Dwight and Sherry to his motorcycle, and explains that he doesn't know where Abraham and Sasha are, but that he's going to find them. Dwight looks at Sherry, and then turns his gun on Daryl, forcing him to hand over the crossbow. Dwight and Sherry get on the bike and ride off. Daryl finds a fuel truck in the woods branded "A.A. Pattrick Fuel Co." Its license plate reads "Patty". He kills the walker in the cab and drives to pick up Abraham and Sasha. They drive down the road in the fuel truck. Daryl tries to radio Rick. "Help," a muffled voice on the radio replies.



"
Start to Finish
"


Daryl's voice is heard when he is asking if anybody is receiving his voice. Eugene picks up the walkie-talkie and says, "help."

Daryl, Abraham and Sasha are still headed back to Alexandria, but are stopped by a 
group
 of bikers blocking the road. 
One of the bikers
, tells them to give up all their supplies and their truck, to which, Daryl asks, "Why should we?". The biker then claims, "Your property, now belongs to 
Negan
".



"
No Way Out
"


The leader takes their sidearms. He orders 
Timmy
 to take Daryl to the back of the truck and inspect its cargo while Sasha and Abraham stay behind. After some conversation between Abraham, Sasha and the leader of the gang, the whole group of bikers explodes. Daryl then comes out from behind the truck holding an RPG, having subdued and killed the Savior who went to check cargo with him, getting cut on the back in the process, and leaves with Abraham and Sasha. They arrive in Alexandria that night, only to find the safe zone overrun by walkers. Glenn gets in the truck and proposes to Daryl that they use the vehicle to lead the walkers away, but Daryl suggests an alternate plan. As the fighting intensifies, he dumps fuel from the truck into the pond in the middle of Alexandria, then launches an RPG into the water. A ball of fire erupts in the sky, distracting the walkers. The Survivors and all the Alexandrians keep killing and killing as the walkers flock to the fire, going up in flames as they stumble into the lake. The next morning, 
Denise
 stitches up the cut on his back.



"
The Next World
"


Daryl tracks down Denise to review her list of requested supplies and asks why she wants orange soda. Denise explains her plan to surprise Tara, who's leaving with Heath on a two-week supply run. Rick and Daryl leave for the supply run. He gives them a map to agricultural supply stores and instructions to track down sorghum, a "criminally underrated grain" that could help replenish their low food supply. In the car, Rick predicts they will finally find food and new people that day.

Daryl notes that they haven't encountered anyone in weeks. Rick and Daryl spot a sorghum barn and find a truck inside. They open the truck and discover a large store of supplies. Rick proposes they drive the truck and come back for their car later. En route to Alexandria, Rick and Daryl stop at a gas station to scavenge. Daryl finds a tipped over vending machine, and they chain it to the truck to flip it over. Just then, a masked man races over and crashes into Rick, prompting Rick and Daryl to pull their guns on him. The assailant introduces himself as 
Paul Rovia
 -- though his friends call him Jesus -- and tells Rick and Daryl that he was just running from walkers. Rick asks him how many walkers he's killed -- the test for new members of the group -- but Daryl cuts him off. Eventually, they decide to let Jesus go on his way.

While Daryl and Rick talk about Jesus and whether to follow him, they're surprised by the sound of gunshots behind the gas station. They investigate and discover firecrackers in a trash can. Realizing it was a trick, they run back just in time to see Jesus driving off with the truck, dragging the vending machine behind it. Rick and Daryl sprint after the truck and find the vending machine discarded in the middle of the road. Daryl shatters the display case and stuffs orange sodas for Denise and some snacks into his bag. Then they keep running. Rick and Daryl catch up with Jesus and hold him at gunpoint. Rick ties Jesus up, assuring him the knots are loose enough to eventually wriggle free. Then Rick and Daryl drive off in the truck. As they drive across a field, Rick and Daryl hear a sudden noise and realize that Jesus is on the roof of the truck

Rick screeches to a halt, sending Jesus tumbling to the ground. On foot, Daryl chases after Jesus while Rick kills nearby walkers. Jesus and Daryl wind up struggling inside the truck and Jesus accidentally knocks it into neutral, causing the truck to roll into a pond and sink. Daryl begrudgingly agrees not to abandon Jesus, who was knocked unconscious, after Rick points out that Jesus saved Daryl from a walker. Later, Daryl guards an unconscious Jesus in the back seat as Rick drives them back to Alexandria. As they arrive in Alexandria, Daryl tells Rick that he was right when he once suggested they stop bringing new people into the community. Rick disagrees: he thinks Daryl was right in the first place.

Rick and Daryl bring Jesus to the infirmary so Denise can check him out. Later, in the townhouse basement, Daryl and Rick leave water and a note next to Jesus' still unconscious body. Back at home, Rick wearily flops onto his couch, where Michonne joins him. He tells her Daryl is guarding a man that they brought in.



"
Knots Untie
"


Daryl is first seen preparing the motor home for the trip to 
Hilltop
, and reluctantly accepts a homemade oatcake from Denise for his efforts in trying to retrieve a soda for Tara.

On the road, the group stops as they approach an overturned car and Jesus recognizes it as one of Hilltop's. Daryl follows tracks to a nearby building where they rescue four of Jesus' people before continuing on their journey.

They arrive at the Hilltop, where they meet Gregory who orders the group to clean up before talking with him. As they wait in the foyer, Abraham asks Daryl if he's ever thought about settling down. "You think shit's settled?" Daryl replies.

After Ethan stabs Gregory, Daryl saves Abraham by breaking the arm of the resident who was throttling him. He asks Abraham if he is alright, to which he replies he is better than alright.

Jesus explains that a group called 
the Saviors
 agreed not to attack the Hilltop in exchange for half of their supplies. Rick mentions Daryl, Sasha and Abraham's encounter on the road with a group of Saviors', and Daryl argues that they just have a good story. He suggests that they wipe out the Saviors and strike up a deal with Hilltop in which they exchange supplies. Jesus agrees to discuss this with Gregory.

After the deal is made, the group head back to Alexandria. Daryl looks at Glenn and Maggie's ultrasound scan before passing it on to the others.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"


Daryl is present at the church meeting where Rick discusses the deal that was made with the Hilltop.

At a meeting to coordinate the attack, Andy draws a map of the interior and exterior of the Saviors' compound for Daryl, Rick, Glenn, Maggie, and Michonne.

At the Saviors' compound that night, as Andy waits for one of the guards to get Craig, Daryl approaches silently and kills the other guard. The others emerge from hiding and clear the scene before killing the first guard when he returns with Craig. They then sneak into the compound.

After the alarm is activated, Daryl and the others shoot at the Saviors' as they make their way through the compound. When the fight is over, the group emerge from the building. Suddenly, a lone surviving Savior tries to escape on Daryl's motorcycle. He is shot off the bike and Daryl tackles him as he tries to flee, punching him as he demands to know where he got the bike. A voice comes over the Saviors' walkie-talkie, revealing that they have Carol and Maggie.



"
The Same Boat
"


Daryl is seen at the beginning of the episode along with the rest of the Survivors when Paula is spying on them. At the end of the episode, Daryl and the group arrive at the slaughterhouse to save Carol and Maggie. He and Carol hug each other.



"
Twice as Far
"


Carol visits Daryl, who is sitting by his recently recovered bike. Daryl admits to Carol that he should have killed Dwight while he had the chance. Daryl and Rosita soon accompany Denise on a run for medical supplies. However while returning, Denise is shot by Dwight with Daryl's crossbow, leading to a standoff with Dwight and 
Neil
's group. A captive Eugene creates a distraction allowing Daryl and the others to kill several Saviors, including Neil, forcing Dwight and the remaining to flee. Later back at Alexandria, Daryl buries Denise, clearly somewhat saddened.



"
East
"


Daryl sits on his motorcycle, looking at the Dennis keychain that Denise found at the apothecary. Despite Rosita's protests, Daryl opens the front gate and leaves on his motorcycle.

Daryl is seen making his way through the field where Dwight fled towards. He hears a noise in the trees and shoots his crossbow, coming inches away from hitting Rosita in the head. He tells him they shouldn't have come after him, to which Michonne says he never should have left. Glenn tries to stop Daryl from going after Dwight, but he refuses. He explains that he tried to help him before but if he had killed him, Denise would still be alive. Rosita joins Daryl as Glenn and Michonne head back to Alexandria.

In the woods, Daryl and Rosita creep up on the Saviors' camp where Glenn and Michonne are being held. Glenn tries to scream a warning to Daryl through his gag, but Daryl is caught off-guard by Dwight sneaking up behind him. "Hi Daryl," he says as he points a gun at him. Daryl turns around and Dwight pulls the trigger. A large amount of blood splatter is seen as Dwight then says, "You'll be alright."



"
Last Day on Earth
"


As the other members of the Survivors are lined up outside the truck Daryl is being held in, Dwight drags an injured Daryl out along with Rosita, Glenn and Michonne. As they are sitting in line on their knees, 
Negan
 begins his monologue and points his 
bat
 towards Daryl and the others during his game of "Eeney, Meeney, Miney, Moe".

"
The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
"


After 
Negan
 kills Abraham and starts taunting Rosita, Daryl attacks Negan by punching him in the face. The Saviors however restrains Daryl and Dwight points Daryl's crossbow at his head and asks Negan if he can do it, but Negan has other plans. Dwight drags Daryl back in line. Daryl's outburst prompts Negan to bash Glenn's skull in as well. Daryl is seen shocked, even flinching in horror as Glenn is beaten to death because of his own refusal to cooperate. Daryl feels a deep sense of guilt and responsibility for Glenn's death and then watches on helplessly as Negan returns with Rick and threatens the lives of the surviving group members (Daryl included) if Rick does not obey Negan's command to amputate Carl's left arm. After Negan is satisfied, he stops Rick from performing the amputation believing he has become submissive and thus spares Daryl's life along with the others who were also threatened.

He is later taken captive by Negan, and declares that due to his bravery, he shall now join Negan's group. However, Negan says that if Rick ever tries to fight Negan and his Saviors again, Daryl will suffer slow mutilation from either Negan or Rick, who will be forced by Negan. Negan leaves a truck with the Survivors so they can transport the goods they are to produce for him. He says they will return for their first offering in one week. When the bodies of Abraham and Glenn are being carried away, Rick imagines life for his group if they never went to war with the Saviors and Daryl is seen eating dinner with the others.



"
The Cell
"


Daryl appears huddled in a dark corner of a cell, naked. Dwight occasionally comes by with a small sandwich made with dog food to feed Daryl, and leaves a radio playing "Easy Street" by Daryl's cell all day. Daryl endures this torture for several days, before he is taken out of his cell by Dwight. Dwight brings Daryl to the doctor of the Sanctuary, who says that Daryl's gunshot wound will heal. Daryl encounters Sherry, who he recognizes, but Dwight forbids her from talking to him. Before leaving, she tells him he should do whatever the Saviors tell him, or he will receive worse treatment. 
Dr. Carson
 examines Daryl's injured shoulder and assures him that Negan will take care of him.

As Dwight leads Daryl back down the hall, Negan appears and pulls Dwight aside for a talk. 
Fat Joey
 guards Daryl at gunpoint. Directly in front of Daryl is an open door; beyond it, he sees an efficiency apartment. Dwight drags him away. Dwight takes Daryl outside and shows him the compound's fence-line. They watch as two workers secure a new walker outside, it's the red-headed man from the marketplace. Dwight says Daryl will be forced to work in the yard if he doesn't make the right choices.

Back in his cell, Daryl tells Dwight that he will never kneel for Negan. "I said that, too.," says Dwight. He shuts the door. The sound of the lock is heard and the music resumes. Daryl desperately probes the cell walls and kicks the door. While Dwight is off capturing 
a Savior
 who deserted the Sanctuary, Daryl makes an escape attempt. Joey brings him a sandwich. As he shuts the door, and this time, the sound of the lock isn't heard. Daryl waits, then gently eases the door open.

He then sneaks out, and creeps down the hallway, but Sherry stops him and attempts to convince him to go back, but he ignores her and makes his way outside. He does not make it far as he is stopped by a group of Saviors who anticipated his escape. Negan appears: "Are we pissing our pants yet?" he asks. Negan asks the Saviors surrounding Daryl "Who are you?" They all respond, "Negan." He tells Daryl that he failed his chance to prove he's ready for the next step. Negan presents three options: Death, working for points, or working for Negan and living like a king. Daryl doesn't reply. Negan swings Lucille at Daryl, stopping just short of hitting him, but Daryl doesn't flinch which Negan admired. Negan leaves as the Saviors beat Daryl up.

Sherry stops by Daryl's cell and apologizes for stealing his motorcycle and crossbow in the woods. Upon his return, Dwight is infuriated at Daryl's escape attempt. Dwight taunts Daryl, claiming his actions got Glenn killed. He leaves a picture of Glenn's smashed skull in the cell before closing the door. Dwight changes the radios music to Roy Orbison's "Crying" in order to torture Daryl physiologically. The picture combined with the music overwhelm Daryl, who begins to cry in guilt for Glenn. Dwight hears him sobbing from the hallway and slightly smiles and walks away. Dwight returns sometime later and finds Daryl passed out next to a pile of vomit. He brings Daryl to Negan, who attempts to lure Daryl to work for him. He asks who Daryl is, in which Daryl plainly responds "Daryl". Dwight brings Daryl back to his cell, and yells at him for jeopardizing his own life. "I get why you did it, why you took it," says Daryl. "You were thinking about someone else. That's why I can't." Daryl settles back into his cell as "Easy Street" begins playing once more.



"
Service
"


Daryl has become a slave to Negan, and helps him round up Alexandria's supplies. When Rick tries to talk to Daryl, Negan immediately butts in and forbids Rick and everyone else in Alexandria from talking to Daryl, or else Negan will make Rick mutilate Daryl. When Negan is told that Maggie had died and had been buried alongside the graves of Glenn and Abraham (when in actuality Gabriel had made a false grave for Maggie to keep her status and whereabouts a secret from Negan), Daryl looks sad as he believes that Maggie had died because of Glenn's death taking its toll on her, causing Daryl to feel even more guilty. At the end of the day, Daryl is offered the chance to beg to stay in Alexandria, but says nothing, and leaves with the Saviors. Dwight takes the motorcycle from Spencer and rides up to Daryl and says, "You can have it back; just say the word." Daryl remains silent, so Dwight drives off.



"
Sing Me a Song
"


Daryl is seen looking at what happened between Carl and Negan.

Later, we see Daryl entered the room where Negan is showing Carl his "wives" with 
Dwight
. Daryl asks why Carl's there, but Negan tells him that's none of his business. Seconds later, Negan tells him to go with Dwight to get a mop.

Time passes, Daryl is seen holding a mop. As Negan arrives, Daryl is kneeling, helplessly, along with everyone else. While Negan is using an iron to burn the left side of 
Mark
's face, Daryl is seen showing sorrow. Afterwards, Negan tells Daryl to clean up the floor.

Daryl is then seen walking to the truck of which Negan and Carl are in. Negan tells him he's taking him home because he was worried. Daryl responded, "If you do anything to him-" but gets interrupted by Negan. Negan tells Dwight to put Daryl in a "time-out", and gets put back to his room.

While Daryl sits in his room, he hears footsteps outside his door. A note slides under, and the footsteps fade away. Daryl picks up the note, and reads it. The sign says "go now," with a key attached to it.



"
Hearts Still Beating
"


At the Saviors' compound, Daryl escapes his cell. He sneaks down the hallways and hears Saviors approaching, so he ducks into Dwight's apartment. Inside, he devours a jar of peanut butter, changes into Dwight's clothes and listens to the Saviors in the hall. He notices Dwight's carved figurines on a table.

Daryl hears the Saviors leave the hallway. He seizes the moment and flees the apartment, but not before flipping the table and smashing Dwight's carved figurines.

Daryl grabs a pipe from the hallway before heading outside and running over to the motorcycles. Fat Joey appears and pleads for his life, but Daryl beats him to death with the pipe as Jesus arrives. Daryl notices Rick's gun on Joey's belt and takes it before hopping on a motorcycle and leaving the compound with Jesus.

As the others reunite at the Hilltop gates, Daryl appears with Jesus. Rick is shocked to see him and the two share a hug before Daryl presents Rick with his gun that he retrieved from Fat Joey. Together, they all stride towards the mansion.



"
Rock in the Road
"


Daryl is seen with Rick and the others in the Hilltop mansion, trying to get 
Gregory
 to join the fight against the Saviors. Daryl calls out to Gregory, for his big mouth and not being part of their plan.

After they leave his office, Enid shows them that Hilltop members had agreed to join the fight after she had been telling each one of them the plan.

Rick states that more soldiers will be needed to take on the Saviors and their many outposts. Daryl reasons they might not need a large army and if they find the right supplies they could blow them up. Tara reminds him there are civilians inside the Sanctuary.

Afterwords, Jesus then decides to take Rick and the group to the 
Kingdom
, to meet 
Ezekiel
. He leads them to the outskirts of the Kingdom, where they are greeted by Richard and Alvaro. When taken in to meet Ezekiel, Jesus introduces him to Rick and requests Ezekiel to join in on Rick's plan to fight the Saviors

Ezekiel is reluctant to break the peace with the Saviors and ultimately refuses, however, Daryl is offered asylum by Ezekiel since the Saviors won't harm him there. While reluctant, Rick tells Daryl to stay and try to convince Ezekiel to change his mind about helping them. 
Simon
 and the Saviors later search Alexandria for Daryl, but are unable to find him due to Daryl being at the Kingdom.



"
New Best Friends
"


Daryl confronts Morgan about his meeting with the Saviors. He comments on his injury and says if Carol saw that and knew about Glenn and Abraham, she'd be leading them straight to the Saviors. Morgan agrees and says that's why she left.

Daryl joins 
Richard
 as he practices archery. Richard says that Morgan told him he was a bowman and hands him a new crossbow before asking for his help.
Daryl and Richard take some weapons from his hidden trailer and arrive at a location by the side of a road commonly used by the Saviors. Richard tells Daryl his plan to kill the Saviors when they pass and when the others find them, they will follow a trail that leads to a weapons cache then to a house that someone Ezekiel cares about is living in. When Richard mentions it's a woman, Daryl demands to know her name. Richard says it's Carol and he was hoping he didn't know who she was. Daryl refuses to put her in danger, and when Richard is about to go ahead, Daryl tackles him to the ground and they fight. Daryl tells Richard that if anything happens to Carol, he will kill him.

Daryl arrives at Carol's house and the two hug. He tells her that Jesus took them to the Kingdom and he asks why she left. Inside, Carol explains to him why she had to go and starts to cry as she asks if everyone back home is OK. Daryl lies and tells her the Saviors came but they made a deal like Ezekiel did and everyone is fine. They eat together and as he leaves, he turns back to hug her and tells her to watch out for herself.

Back at The Kingdom, Daryl sits by 
Shiva
's cage as Morgan appears. Daryl tells him that he found Carol and Morgan tells him she didn't want him to tell anyone where she was. Daryl says he understands, and that they need The Kingdom and he has to make that happen. Morgan apologizes and says it can't be him. Daryl says whatever he's holding on to is already gone. Morgan says that he is the same as him and Daryl says he doesn't know anything about him, but Morgan says he knows Daryl didn't tell Carol about Glenn and Abraham or she'd be there now. Daryl leaves and tells him he's going back to The Hilltop in the morning to get ready.

The next day, The Kingdom gates open and Daryl walks out. He looks back at Morgan before heading to The Hilltop.



"
The Other Side
"


Daryl sits outside Maggie's trailer, despondent. She brings him a plate of food and places her hand on his shoulder before heading back inside.

Kal
 yells that the Saviors are coming. Enid runs over to Daryl and asks him to help her hide Maggie.

Enid guides Daryl and Maggie to a root cellar and they hide behind some shelves. As a 
Savior
 takes some supplies, Daryl readies his knife to attack but Maggie holds him back. When the Savior leaves, they come out of their hiding place. Maggie remarks that Daryl nearly killed a Savior unnecessarily, and he says that he deserves to die. Maggie says that ever since he arrived, he has avoided her. She asks Daryl to look at her. He starts to cry and apologizes. Maggie insists he is not to blame for Glenn's death, and that Glenn thought Daryl was one of the good things in this world. She tells Daryl they need to win and hugs him.

Later, Daryl asks Jesus where Sasha and Rosita are.



"
Something They Need
"


Tara revealed to Rick and the group that she encountered a group with guns while on her supply-run with Heath called 
Oceanside
 who had once fought the Saviors but lost, and are now in hiding. Realizing she needs to break her promise in order to acquire the guns and people to win the war against the Saviors, Tara leads the group to Oceanside. Following Tara, Rick brings Daryl, along with Eric, Aaron, Carl, Michonne, Gabriel, Enid, Tobin, Francine, Scott and Jesus.

While talking to Daryl, Jesus voices his regrets about Rosita and Sasha, chastising himself for not stopping their attack against Negan. Daryl assures Jesus that Sasha is a good shot and guesses that they could be back at the Hilltop.

Later, the Survivors set off the explosives near the Oceanside walls. Daryl and Jesus capture 
Beatrice
 and 
Kathy
 as the other residents flee. They are able to round up the residents and Rick assures them that he doesn't plan to hurt anyone but they have something they need. 
Natania
 appears, holding Tara at gunpoint. 
Cyndie
 tells her people that the Survivors wants to fight the Saviors. Beatrice suggests they join the fight, but Natania refuses to lose more people to the Saviors.

Michonne warns Rick that walkers are approaching. The Survivors and the Oceansiders work together and take down the walkers. Beatrice hands Rick his knife back and they shake hands. Natania angrily concedes and allows the Survivors to take their guns but she remains adamant they won't fight.

The Oceanside residents watch the Survivors leave with their guns. Gabriel wonders whether they need to take all the guns. Rick insists it's necessary.

The Survivors returns to Alexandria late at night. Rosita opens the gate for them. Jesus asks about Sasha, but Rosita doesn't answer. She tells them they have a visitor.

Rosita leads the Survivors to the Alexandria prison cell: Dwight sits behind bars. Daryl charges at Dwight but Rick and Michonne hold him back. Rosita says that Dwight wants to help. "Okay," says Rick. He aims his gun at Dwight and orders him to kneel.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"


Daryl and the group interrogate Dwight in the prison cell. As Tara furiously reprimands him for murdering Denise, he replies that she was not his intended target. Daryl slams Dwight against the wall and holds him at knifepoint. Dwight insists he's on their side and offers to work with them as Tara insists Daryl kills him, but he stands down. Dwight presents his plan to take down Negan.

The group agree to Dwight's plan and he heads back to the Sanctuary. Daryl says that no matter how sorry he is, he will kill him once this is all over.

Daryl, Rosita and Aaron wire explosives in an empty truck outside the Alexandria gate in preparation for the Saviors arrival.

"
Mercy
"


Daryl communicates with Dwight by shooting crossbow arrows with information wrapped on them at each other. Dwight supplies Daryl with the locations of the Saviors lookouts on the road to their compound. He also directs a large force of Saviors to investigate an explosion set up by the Militia, well-aware that its actually a trap for whoever goes to investigate.

Daryl and Morgan kill Saviors at various lookout points. One by one, they cross the targets off a list supplied by Dwight. Daryl takes the dead Saviors gun and posts, analyzing his gun which is marked with the number of kills on it. "Neighborhood" is marked off of the list.

At the bridge, Daryl meets with Carol, Tara and Morgan in the highway. Daryl, Morgan, Carol and Tara wait on the highway until the herd arrives; they vacate the road in haste. Moments later, the SUV they parked on the exit ramp explodes. Dwight dispatches a large team of Saviors to investigate the explosion. Daryl and Morgan rig a tripwire across a road. They join Carol and Tara on a pedestrian overpass.

The group on the overpass spots a walker nearing the tripwire. Morgan kills the stray walker endangering the tripwire and sees the caravan of Saviors in the distance. On the road, the Savior caravan trips the wire and sets off an explosion, killing them all. The herd approaches, drawn by the explosion. Morgan and Tara get in a car, preparing to leave. Carol urges Daryl to be careful.

Daryl continues leading the herd on his bike. Daryl shoots a succession of explosive barrels while riding his motorcycle toward the Sanctuary, guiding the herd. Daryl regroups with the Survivors, while they wait for Gabriel at their rendezvous point. Rick tells Daryl that Gabriel stayed behind to save him, but they can't wait for him any longer. Daryl signals the group to get back in their vehicles. They prepare to enact the next phase of their plan.

At a second Savior outpost, Daryl and Rick shoot a guard and enter the front gate.



"
The Damned
"


Daryl, Rick and and three others enter the 
Shephard Office Plaza
 from another direction, silently taking out the two guards. While the others stay behind to watch for Saviors retreating inside from the courtyard, Rick and Daryl go from room to room searching foe the weapons armory. They are here to find guns.

In the office building, Rick scrutinizes the layout provided by Dwight. Upon rejoining with Daryl and having swept the ground floor, they deduce that the weapons, including 50 calibers, must be upstairs.

Daryl tosses his crossbow into a ventilation shaft. Daryl and Rick arrive on the second floor, and Daryl expresses doubt that Dwight's instructions were accurate, but Rick points out that they have been so far. He tells Daryl that they will use the heavy artillery to take out the Saviors in the courtyard below, bringing a swift end to the battle. They split up. 

Daryl searches the office block room to room and discovers a small cavity with a shackled handcuff and stale food; it is a cell for torture, similar to the one he was 
subjected
 to at the Sanctuary. While this is happening, Rick is encountered by 
Morales
, who hasn't been seen since 
Atlanta
.



"
Monsters
"


Daryl saves Rick from Morales who is holding Rick at gunpoint and kills him without hesitation despite Rick's pleas. Rick tries to explain how they both knew Morales, but Daryl says he knew fully well who he was and that them knowing each other in a past life now meant nothing given their current circumstances. Daryl then asks Rick if he was able to find the guns they were looking for, Rick answers that he was unable to. Suddenly, the Saviors that Morales had called back earlier close in on them and attack.

After Daryl runs out of ammunition, Rick notices a fire extinguisher and shoots it to create a cloud of smoke. Daryl and Rick are able to take out some of the Saviors until other Aaron and members of the Militia arrive.

After taking out the outpost, Daryl and Rick are about to leave onto their next mission when they are fired at by an unknown assailant. Rick, hinting that the attacker is alone, gives his word that they will not harm him if he surrenders and give him a car to escape an oncoming herd. The attacker turns out to be 
Todd
, a worker for the Saviors who had survived the attack at the outpost. Rick asks where the supposed guns that were meant to be at the outpost are and Todd answers that they were moved to 
Gavin
's outpost. When Todd asks if he can leave after answering their question, Daryl promptly shoots Todd in the head which surprises Rick. The two then leave.



"
Some Guy
"


Daryl and Rick pursue the Saviors on an empty road. Daryl opens fire but the machine gun opens fire on him, causing him to fall off the bike. Rick continues his pursuit. There are walkers in the road ahead, causing the Savior truck to swerve and the shooter to lose balance for a moment.

When fires opens up again, Rick swerves and Daryl is revealed behind him. He shoots the turret operator. Rick pulls up beside the truck and jumps into the passenger seat. He stabs 
the driver
 and tosses him from the truck. Still, it drives through a rail and off the road. 

Daryl rushes to the roadside to see the truck on its side as Rick crawls up the hill. Rick says they have the weapon, and the two of them go check to see if the driver survived.



"
The Big Scary U
"


On the roadside, Daryl and Rick go after the 
Savior
 they kicked out of the truck. He is dying. He tells Daryl and Rick that the Kingdommers are dead and Ezekiel, Jerry and Carol killed everyone. As a result, he promises everyone in the Survivors is going to die before he dies himself. 

Daryl explores the crashed truck. Gas is leaking from it. He tries to gather the guns and ammo with Rick's help. They find explosives inside. He says that with the Kingdom gone, they should use these bombs to bust open the Sanctuary and end everything. Rick, however, vouches for the workers and families inside. Daryl wants to blow open the south side. Rick still claims those people might not make it out. If the Saviors don't surrender, everyone will fight them and he insists that Daryl stick with the plan.

Daryl refuses to listen and heads off with the bombs on his own. Rick tries to stop him, but Daryl bites back and insists he has his own people to look after. Rick again tries to stop him, but Daryl punches him in the face, igniting a fight. Rick and Daryl's fight continues. Rick throws the bombs, but ends up in a choke hold. The truck starts on fire and eventually explodes just as the two were running from it. They sit and watch it burn, disappointed, together.  

Back on the road, Rick tries to start his truck but it's no good. Daryl pulls up on his bike. "There's a plan," Rick said. "We gotta win," Daryl insists. He asks Rick if he still going to talk to the Scavengers, he says he will. Then, they head off in separate directions. 



"
The King, the Widow, and Rick
"


After Daryl returns to Alexandria, Tara tells him that she understands why he spared Dwight and feels he made the right choice as Dwight is the only reason they've gotten so far. However, Tara is determined to kill Dwight when its over. Daryl suggests that they will kill him together and that they won't have to wait for the war to be over. Later he and Tara get in a truck and crash into 
Zia
's vehicle killing her. Then he, Tara, Michonne and Rosita are outside of the Sanctuary looking at the walkers then says "finishing it."



"
Time for After
"


Daryl, Michonne, Rosita and Tara discuss their rogue plan; with Daryl charging the truck into the building and send the walkers into the Sanctuary. Michonne, Rosita, and Tara will cover him and distract the walkers. Morgan joins them soon after and offers to help. Rosita shows doubts about the plan, concerned about the workers inside the building and the plan going awry. Daryl argues that, without the Kingdom's forces, they do not have the numbers to force a surrender, but Rosita reminds them of Rick's proposition to the Scavengers. Tara refuses to trust the Scavengers for their betrayal and regrets not saying anything about Oceanside soon, and Tara is willing to follow with Daryl's plan.

Rosita leaves, not wanting to do with the plan, while Daryl, Tara and Michonne drive the truck to the edge of the Sanctuary's perimeter as Morgan keeps watch. As Tara takes point, Daryl turns to Michonne, asking if she's prepared. Having taken Rosita's words into consideration, Michonne decides the risk is not worth it. Daryl allows her to leave. Daryl, Tara and Morgan and the lookouts set themselves up for the breach.

Daryl drives toward the building. Several Saviors perched at the window are fired upon by Tara, Morgan and the lookouts as Daryl crashes the truck into the Sanctuary, breaching the walls and allowing the herd to pour in. Daryl and Tara retreat as the walkers begin making their way inside.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


Daryl is first seen at the camp with the others, he talks to Michonne about the game plan going forward, and he's sure of what they're about to do. She apologizes for not going with the plan, but Daryl tells her not to be sorry.

Daryl is with Tara, Michonne and Rosita as they look out from the woods nearby and they talk about the mistakes. Daryl uses smoke bombs to attract the Saviors. Dwight drives a caravan right into Daryl's trap and he, along with everyone else opens fire on them. Dwight then kills some of the Saviors himself. Laura shoots Dwight in the arm and escapes before she can be killed.

Daryl and the others approach Dwight with their guns raised. He says that one of the Saviors got away so he can't go back to the Sanctuary. He tells them that Eugene is the one who orchestrated the Saviors' escape. Daryl takes the vest Dwight was wearing off from him and the group takes Dwight, along with all of the Saviors' guns, and leave.

Daryl is later seen at the sewers along with everyone else.



"
Honor
"


Daryl is seen holding Judith as he remains in the sewers with the other Alexandrians as the Saviors' grenades continue to blow apart Alexandria above them. Dwight points out that the Saviors will soon run out of ammo and insists they stay put until the siege is over, but Daryl insists they'll die if they stay here. Rosita tells Dwight that they must get everyone at the Hilltop. Dwight questions the plan to bring everyone together in the Hilltop. "All of us, together," Daryl injects, "We'll be their worst damn nightmare."

Daryl approaches Rick and Carl. He hands over Judith and offers condolences to Rick. He and Carl share a glance at one another and Daryl nods to him before heading out. Daryl and Tobin resurface to confirm that the Saviors have indeed left Alexandria. Rick insists on staying in Alexandria with Carl, who won't make it, while the rest of the group travels to the Hilltop. Daryl takes Judith and promises he'll keep her safe. "These people, you saved them all," Daryl tells Carl. "It's all you, man." He says his goodbye to Carl and he walks off and Tara follows. 



"
Dead or Alive Or
"


Daryl leads the remaining Alexandrians and Dwight under the bridge and out of sight of the Saviors. The group comes across a walker in the forest. Tara moves in to deal with it, but allows it to cross over to Dwight, claiming that it escaped her grasp. Dwight dispatches it before the group heads forward. Rosita and Daryl discuss the Savior report and deduce that Carson and Gabriel are also heading towards the Hilltop.

The Alexandrians, having walked a considerable distance, rest in the forest. As Daryl and Rosita retrace their steps to cover their tracks, Tara, still vengeful, questions why Dwight is still alive. Daryl and Rosita agree that Dwight may still prove to be a valuable asset, with Rosita deciding to wait on dealing with him until they reach the Hilltop.

Daryl, Rosita and Tara look over a map at the different routes the Saviors can travel from the Sanctuary to the Hilltop, finding that most of their paths can be potentially dangerous. Dwight, however, points out that an alternate path - through a swamp is seldom used, due to the risks it poses against the Saviors. Silence falls over the group, and Tara realizes that they are considering taking the swamp route, voicing her opposition to the plan.

The Alexandrians question Dwight's loyalties, fearing that he could potentially turn against the Militia the same way he deserted the Saviors. He argues that while he put down his fellow survivors, one escaped, and affirms that he will not return to the Saviors, seeing that there is now a price on his head for his betrayal. He solidifies his choice to side with the Militia, accepting that whatever happens to him after Negan's fall happens. Having heard his words, Daryl agrees to traverse the swamps.

En-route to the swamp, Daryl and Dwight discuss Sherry and the possibility of finding her in the swamp. They approach the edge of the water, finding the murky depths littered with decaying walkers. Daryl gathers volunteers to assist with clearing out the infestation. Dwight is disallowed and Tara opts to stay behind to watch the group.

Daryl, Rosita, Siddiq, Scott and the other volunteers continue to dispatch walkers in their path, with Rosita coming close to being dragged under. Daryl and Siddiq later find a multitude of gurgling corpses blocking their route forward. They press on, quickly and carefully putting down each walker in their path.

Back at the swamp, Daryl lets his rage fly, berating Tara for allowing Dwight to leave and risking him giving away their group to the Saviors. Having seen Dwight's efforts to sway the Saviors away from their location, Tara is convinced that Dwight has changed for the better. Daryl remains unconvinced, but forgoes continuing the conversation any longer, leading the Alexandrians through the now-clear waters.

Daryl and the Alexandrians arrive at the Hilltop gates, with Daryl bearing the news of the town's downfall and the loss of Carl. News of Carl's death brings Enid to her knees in sorrow, and Maggie comforts her.



"
The Key
"


Daryl is seen when Rick and Michonne arrive at Hilltop and reunite with Judith. Daryl talks to Rick near Glenn's grave, and apologizes to Rick for attacking the Sanctuary behind Rick's back. Rick says it's right and he should've only worried about their people. He assures him that he's ready to fight Negan despite Carl's death. They decide to join a team of lookouts scattered around Hilltop. He goes on to thank Daryl for getting everyone to Hilltop.



"
Do Not Send Us Astray
"


Daryl is among the lookouts who blares their horns to signal to the Hilltop that the Saviors are en route to the town. When 
Simon
 and the Saviors arrives, Daryl rides up on his motorcycle and opens fire with his machine gun, killing several Saviors. Simon's convoy follows Daryl through the gate. Hilltoppers block the convoy with a bus and fire at the Saviors. The battle begins in earnest and Daryl and everyone open fire at the Saviors.

During the battle, Daryl sees Simon and Dwight sneaking up on Tara and shouts a warning, but is too late as Dwight shoots Tara in the arm with an arrow. The group manages to drive the Saviors out as they escape in their vehicles.

Hilltop cleans up in the aftermath of battle. Daryl and Tara discuss Dwight shooting her. Tara tells Daryl that she was with the Governor when they first met. Daryl references his brother and says he would be with the Saviors if he were still around. Tara has been vouching for Dwight. "I saw him try and help us win," she tells Daryl, but he refuses to accept her word and leaves.

During the night, the injure residents turn and move in on the Barrington House. Mayhem breaks out as the walkers attack. Daryl, Rick, Michonne, Ezekiel, Jesus and Siddiq fight back. Daryl kills the zombified 
Wesley
 and 
Dana
, as Rick and Morgan kill the remaining walkers. They notice that the walkers were all their people.

Carol informs Rick, Daryl and Maggie that Tobin wasn't bitten. Rick recalls that Negan's bat was covered in walker blood, leading them to realize that the Saviors used their weapons to infect them. Daryl and Rick inform Tara. Having been wounded by a Savior arrow, Tara accepts her fate.



"
Still Gotta Mean Something
"


Daryl talks with Tara and she tells Daryl that her arrow wound did not infect her. She deduces that Dwight shot her with a clean arrow and saved her life. Daryl is not convinced by this, thinking he still turn traitor when he didn't warn them about the walker guts, but Tara abandons her immediate quest to kill him. Daryl works on his motorcycle and spots a knife with dried blood, which sparks an idea.

Daryl is seen in Maggie's office, Dianne reports that they don't have enough ammo to fend off another big attack. Presuming the Saviors are low on ammo themselves, Daryl points out that the Saviors might have to go hand to hand if the walker guts were their only option and suggests they fight them hand-to-hand. Rosita points out that Eugene is probably making ammunition for the Saviors.

Daryl and Rosita observe the 
Bullet Factory Outpost
, they see Eugene receiving a shipment of hundreds of bullet casings to make into new bullets. Rosita decides that instead of taking out the machines, they will take out the man, implying she intends to kill Eugene, something that Daryl agrees with.



"
Worth
"


Daryl and Rosita take out the guards escorting Eugene and they capture him. Daryl and Rosita escort Eugene back to the Hilltop. He talks, endlessly, prompting Daryl to threaten to cut his tongue out. Rosita calms him down, insisting Saviors will be out looking for Eugene by now. 

Eugene tries to defend his alliance with Negan, but Rosita blames everyone's deaths on him for helping the Saviors escape the besieged Sanctuary. Eugene argues that Rick is the real cause of the war. Rosita snarls that they are going to lock Eugene up. Daryl, Rosita and Eugene encounter a herd of walkers. While Daryl kills walkers, Eugene makes himself vomit on Rosita and runs off before she is able to recover. Daryl and Rosita follow Eugene's tracks through a pile of ash, completely overlooking his hiding spot.



"
Wrath
"


Daryl and the group review the map, which had been previously delivered by Gregory on behalf of Dwight and prepare to leave to investigate the Savior plans. However, they are unaware that Negan planted these as a ruse to entrap them. Following the map, Daryl and the Survivors witness a massive walker horde in the distance and continue on.

They end up in a large field where Negan taunts them over a public address system. Negan reveals he has Gabriel at gunpoint, their traitor Dwight is a prisoner, and that his people are ready to fire. He counts down from three, as a firing line of Saviors appears on the ridge line of the hill, ready to shoot down the Survivors.

However, as they fire, their weapons all backfire due to Eugene's purposely faulty ammo, killing or injuring many including Negan and rendering the guns ineffective. Gabriel and Dwight overpower their captors and force Negan to flee with "Lucille", his baseball bat. As the Survivors moves in, the remaining Saviors willingly put down their arms and surrender.

After Rick defeats Negan, Daryl listens in as Rick orders the Saviors to return home and proclaims that Negan's rule is over. He tells the gathered people that they will start a new world, living in peace and points to the massive herd in the distance and declares that they must unite to fight the walkers, the real threat.

After the war is over, Daryl drives Dwight deep into the woods. He profusely apologizes for his former actions, but acknowledges to Daryl he deserves to die. Instead, Daryl gives him the keys to the truck and tells him to leave, go make it right and find his wife Sherry, but warns him to never return.

Back in her office at the Hilltop, Daryl listens as Maggie privately talks to Jesus. She is angry at Rick and Michonne, believing that they were both wrong for keeping Negan alive. Together, the two allude to later rectify this error once the Hilltop has time to regroup and fortify. Daryl comes out of the shadow and agrees with her plans.

"
A New Beginning
"


During the year and a half that passed since the end of the war, Daryl reluctantly took charge of the 
Sanctuary
 and it's residents.

At the Sanctuary, the walker-filled yard has been replaced with crops. Rosita helps Eugene with an experiment while 
Laura
 reports something to Daryl. He goes to the yard and notices 
Arat
 and 
Justin
 trying to use a walker as a Scarecrow, like they used to do, under the pretense to scare off the crows, but Daryl puts it down.

A while later, Daryl rides off to meet Rick, Michonne, Carol, Maggie and the others in downtown Washington D.C, to search for a covered wagon and farming equipment in the Smithsonian. Inside, as they walk over a fragile glass floor, they notice a group of walkers under it. Suddenly, a walker drops from a balcony onto it, cracking the pane, before Daryl puts it down.

Rick tells everyone to be safe and the group separates.

By the stairs, 
Cyndie
 sees an old canoe and remembers an experience with her brother. Daryl relates to her and the two of them lift the canoe.

Shortly after, the whole group reunites and gingerly uses ropes to drag an old covered wagon down the stairs and over the glass floor. The glass finally gives way and Ezekiel falls through it, dangling by the rope. Before the walkers can bite him, Daryl shoots at one and Rick and the others finally pull him to safety. Carol joyfully kisses him to celebrate.

The group leaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities.

On the road, Daryl and Rosita catch up with everyone to inform them that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Rick tells Tara, Gabriel, Aaron and 
Anne
 to head back to Alexandria and the rest will go to an alternate route and spend the night at the Sanctuary.

In the woods, the wagon gets caught in the mud as walkers appear from the bushes. It finally budges and everyone rushes to gather the supplies until the walkers overwhelm them and they're forced to leave. 
Ken
 runs back to free his horses, but is bitten in the arm by a walker and then kicked in the ribs by the horse.

Siddiq and Enid try to save him, but Ken succumbs to blood loss and dies from his injuries. A saddened Maggie sobs by his side before putting him down.

At the Sanctuary, Rick and the group arrive to deliver supplies. Michonne points out graffiti that proclaims, 
"We are still Negan"
, and Daryl demands Justin to clean it up. Rick promises to the Saviors that he'll continue to support them so they can get back on their feet. Everyone applauds him and treat him like a celebrity.

Daryl pulls Rick aside to tell him that he no longer wants to lead the place because he doesn't belong there and since it's factory, it can't produce crops. He suggests he return to Hilltop to check on Maggie and Hershel, but Rick argues he should return to Alexandria. 
"Things have changed,"
 Rick says, but Daryl claims it's because Rick changed them, before going out.

Outside, Carol follows Daryl and offers to take over the Sanctuary for him. She tells him about Zeke's proposal and says she wants to take her time. Daryl's surprised and asks if he should stay with her. She declines and rests her head on his shoulder.

The next day, Daryl, Michonne and Rick arrive at the Hilltop to find the workers building gallows.

In the night, the residents gather around the gallows as Maggie explains to her people that the punishment fits the crime. She looks on at 
Gregory
, who has a noose around his neck and is sitting on a horse. Gregory pleads for someone to stop this, but no one moves. A couple of kids show up and Michonne yells for Maggie to stop but it's too late as Daryl smacks the horse and it rides off, leaving Gregory to hang to death to everyone's shock.

Maggie tells her people that she wants this to be the last time they do something like this. A shocked Rick and Michonne look on as Maggie then orders Daryl to cut off the noose.



"
The Bridge
"


While constructing on the bridge, Aaron shares with Daryl his experience as a father with Gracie and tells him someday he'll make a great dad. Meanwhile, Henry arrives to give water to the workers. Justin shoves him down for not giving him extra water and starts drinking from the jug. Henry gets angry and knocks him down with his stick.

A furious Justin gets up to retaliate, but Daryl stops him, saying that the kid's just doing his job. Justin swings at him and Daryl punches him in the face. They start fighting.

Rick arrives and stops them. He tells everyone to go back to work. He takes Daryl to his tent to calm him down, reminding him that they need the Saviors to help in building the bridge in spite of several deserters. However, Daryl says that the Saviors won't fall in line just because he says so.

Rick explains that he wants everyone to be on the same side, and Daryl questions if they actually are, before leaving. Carol advises Rick to talk to him once he has calmed.

A while later, a herd of walkers arrive at the labor site and a commotion ensues. 
Jed
 panics and lets go of one of the giant logs, making it fall onto Aaron's arm, crushing it. Daryl yells to the crew to lift the log while he double-knives the walkers around him. They lift the log but Aaron's arm is crushed. Daryl carries Aaron to the camp as Rick and his group arrives to hold off the walkers.

Daryl rushes Aaron to the infirmary and 
Enid
 quickly decides they need to amputate. Aaron reluctantly agrees as Daryl ties the tourniquet. Enid amputates his arm.

Daryl angrily goes to confront Justin on why the second siren wasn't sounded. Justin claims the radio wasn't charged and Daryl leaps at him, punching him repeatedly with a frying pan. Carol begs for him to stop as the rest of the camp watches. He listens and storms off.

At night, Daryl accompanies Aaron as Rick apologizes to him for what happened. Aaron says that he couldn't know and claims that thanks to Rick: 
"It's not the end of the world anymore... It's the start of a whole new one."
 Daryl listens in thought.



"
Warning Signs
"


At the camp, the Saviors are furious with the news of Justin's death. Alden promises they'll get to the bottom of it but is punched in the face by Jed, who claims he isn't one of them anymore. Carol steps in with her gun at her hip, stopping Jed.

From afar, Daryl aims his crossbow as the Saviors start accusing him and Anne of being the culprits. They grab axes to retaliate when Rick rides in the middle of the group with his gun drawn and warns everyone to back off.

A while later, Rick confronts Daryl about Justin, suggesting he might have been shot with an arrow or bolt. 
"If I was going to kill him, I'd a done it in plain sight,"
 he counters before saying the Saviors don't deserve to have a new beginning while their dead friends didn't get a chance.

Rick ends the conversation asking Daryl to try, reminding him that he once spared the man who left his brother on a rooftop to die. Daryl is left in thought at this.

Later, in the woods, Daryl, Rick and Rosita arrive to save Cyndie and Maggie from a group of walkers. They check on 
Beatrice
 over the walkie but receive no response, so they try to find her and locate her unconscious in the woods. When she wakes up, she tells them she was attacked from behind and that 
Arat
 is missing.

At the camp, Rick implores his team to find Arat before the Saviors find out and leave, delaying the bridge construction.

On the woods, Maggie admits to Daryl that what Rick's doing is right for the future. They find a walker with a bolt in it and Daryl says, 
"I know who took Arat."


At night, Daryl and Maggie arrive at the "Final Warning" building to find Cyndie and a group from Oceanside holding up Arat. Cyndie emotionally reveals that this was their former settlement and recalls how Arat and the Saviors wiped out her people. Justin killed Beatrice's husband while Arat killed Cyndie's brother without mercy.

Cyndie says that they went along with Rick's rules because they thought they had to, until Maggie executed Gregory, 
"showing them the way"
. Since that moment, they have been killing the Saviors responsible for wiping out Oceanside.

Arat starts crying, claiming she had no choice but Cyndie reminds her how she smiled when she killed her brother. Arat begs Daryl and Maggie to help her but they walk away as Cyndie stabs her through the back of the head with a spear.

The next morning, Maggie tells Daryl that they gave Rick's way a chance, but it's time to see Negan.



"
The Obliged
"


At the camp, Daryl watches as 
Jerry
 arrives to warn Rick about Maggie's march to Alexandria and as a panicked Rick radios 
Rachel
 to warn his people not to let Maggie into the community. He walks over to Rick and offers to take him to Alexandria on his motorbike.

On the road, Daryl rides past the right turn and Rick angrily tells him to pull over. Rick asks what is he doing and Daryl reveals he messed with the relay so Maggie will be allowed into Alexandria to kill Negan. Rick jumps at him and the two wrestle until they roll into a giant ditch.

In the ditch, Daryl and Rick argue over the merits of keeping Negan alive. Daryl reminds Rick how Negan turned him into a slave and how no one's on board with him sticking around. Rick says if they martyr Negan then Carl will have died for nothing. Daryl tells Rick he'd die for him and he would have for Carl too, but he has to just let him go. Rick says he never asked anyone to follow him, and Daryl says, 
"Maybe you should have."


Suddenly, they hear gunshots coming from the camp and are forced to help each other escape. As they struggle to climb out, several walkers slip into the ditch. Rick finally crawls out of it and uses a tree branch to get Daryl out as well. With a horde building near the camp, Rick concocts a plan to lead them away while Daryl heads for the river.



"
What Comes After
"


On the bridge, as Rick limps away before collapsing, he hallucinates as Daryl, Maggie, Carol, Ezekiel, and the others rush past him to kill the walkers. Michonne stops and sees Rick's wound. She reminds him she fell in love with him because he's a fighter. After killing the walkers, everyone stops to watch them. Michonne tells Rick how much she loves him and he tells her, 
"This isn't real."
 Michonne tells him to wake up and he does, now alone on the bridge.

The walkers approach as Rick hobbles away. He makes it across the bridge and turns around hoping to see the walkers fall through, to no avail. A walker makes its way inches away from Rick before getting shot in the head by a crossbow bolt. Rick watches as Daryl, Michonne, Maggie, and the rest arrive nearby.

Maggie and Michonne hatch a plan to divert the walkers but Rick won't allow it. He notices the dynamite on the bridge, takes aim, and says to himself 
"I found them,"
 before shooting and igniting the dynamite. The bridge ignites and explodes as Michonne and the rest can only watch in horror. Assuming Rick is dead, Michonne screams out while Maggie and Carol comfort her. Daryl weeps and then walks away.



"
Who Are You Now?
"


Following Rick's presumed death, Daryl started living in the woods after spending a long time searching for his best friend's body. He also found and trained a dog during this time who he just refers to as "
Dog
". 

Six years later, Daryl spearfishes in a lake and kills a walker. As he returns to his tent, he watches as nature takes over a walker stuck in a tree.

The next day, as he walks with a pack of logs, he encounters Carol and 
Henry
 on their way to Hilltop. Carol tells him to come along and Daryl accepts with a smile.



"
Stradivarius
"


Daryl escorts Carol and Henry to his camp by a dam. As he feeds his dog, Carol asks him when was the last time he ate. 
"Dog ate yesterday,"
 he says and walks off.

Carol asks why he's been living in the woods so long and he says it's quiet. She updates him on Henry moving to Hilltop while she deals with things at the Kingdom. Daryl asks why she's really here and she reveals she wants him to come with them. 
"Want me to babysit your boy?"
 Daryl growls. Carol admits Henry could use a mentor to toughen him up, but Daryl says he'll have to learn on his own.

A while later, Daryl skins a snake and throws it into the fire for dinner while Henry asks Carol if she brought him here so Daryl could be his chaperone. At night, Carol gives Daryl a haircut and he reveals he never found Rick's body and got used to being in the woods. Carol suggests he should let it go. Later, as they have dinner, Henry asks Daryl how he got his scar on the eye but he ignores him and leaves to find his dog. 

Henry tails Daryl and finds a walker instead. Daryl shows up and asks if he was following him. Suddenly, Daryl hears his dog barking wildly nearby and rushes over to find it stuck in a trap and surrounded by walkers. Daryl picks off the walkers to save his dog and before a walker can bite him, Henry jumps in and saves him. 
"I told you to stay back,"
 Daryl scolds. From the bushes, Carol secretly lowers her bow and arrow. 

Back at the camp, Henry notices an x shaped scar on Daryl's back as he changes his shirt. He sits next to him and tells him that this is the first time the dog got caught in his trap. Henry thanks him for the save and tells him Carol misses and worries about him. 
"She knows how to find me,"
 Daryl says. Henry suggests he should come to Hilltop with them. Daryl asks if it's so he can look over him, but Henry says 
"It isn't just about me."


In the morning, Daryl loads up his bike for Hilltop and Carol seems overjoyed she convinced him to come. Later, they arrive at Hilltop and hug Tara. Carol tells Jesus that Henry wants to learn how to be a blacksmith. Aaron greets Daryl and tells him they could use his help locating Eugene. Henry tries to tag along but Carol instead says he needs to stay and she will help him find a home.

With the dog leading the way, Daryl, Aaron and Jesus head out to find Eugene.



"
Evolution
"


In the woods, Daryl, Aaron, and Jesus discover a herd middling around in the middle of a field. As they leave, an odd looking walker watches them from the herd.

Later, Jesus tells Aaron that Daryl used to trade with Hilltop before he stopped coming to visit. Aaron encourages him to embrace his new leadership role when Daryl cuts them off and says he can hear the walkers nearby through the wind. As they leave, Jesus looks with suspicion at the incoming herd.

At night, Daryl, Jesus, and Aaron locate Eugene hiding in a barn cellar. A terrified Eugene warns them a herd of walkers is looking for him and they need to leave immediately. 
"This wasn't a normal herd... They were whispering to each other,"
 he tells them. They look at him confused, when suddenly 
Dog
 barks, warning them of the nearby herd. 

In the foggy woods, Eugene suggests to the group that the walkers are evolving. Daryl calls bullshit when Aaron notices they're drawing closer. Jesus demands they split up but Daryl says that instead, he will guide the herd away while he and Aaron take Eugene to the horses.

From the top of an abandoned car, Daryl sets off fireworks to redirect the herd, but a group of walkers ignore the noise and the rest follow their lead, leaving him shocked. A while later, he, along with Michonne, 
Magna
 and 
Yumiko
 arrive to help the others unlock the gate.

Jesus tells Aaron and Eugene to get out while he finishes the walkers and starts taking out several with his sword. He goes to kill the last one but as he attacks it, the walker dodges and stabs him from behind through his chest, shocking everyone. 
"You are where you do not belong"
 the walker whispers to a shocked Jesus before throwing him on the ground.

Daryl shoots it in the head as several more Whisperers arrive and the rest of the group run in to finish them off. As Aaron goes over to Jesus' body, Daryl notices something on the back of the walker and cuts into his neck, revealing a mask. Before they can process it, the whispers get louder and the group circles up to fight them off.

Adaptation
"


In the cemetery, Daryl and the rest proceed to kill the 
Whisperers
 and walkers around them. When more arrive, they're forced to carry Jesus' body away and lock the gates. As they leave, a whisperer opens the lock.

On the road, Michonne tells Daryl they're bringing Jesus back to Hilltop so everyone can have closure and thanks him for helping her with everything. Suddenly, the group notices a small group of walkers nearby. Daryl corners them on a bridge and uses his crossbow to see who are whisperers. He hits one in the leg and the man falls down screaming in pain, attracting walkers to him. The rest try slowly escaping to the other side, where Michonne is waiting for them. They draw their knives and attack, but Michonne and the rest kill them with ease as the final whisperer gets on her knees to surrender. Daryl rips off her mask, to reveal a girl begging for her life. Michonne angrily questions her but when more walkers show up Daryl decides to take her with them.

Later, Daryl and the group arrive at Hilltop with Jesus' body and the captive girl, causing the whole community to react in disbelief. In the cellar, Daryl throws the girl in a cell and tells Henry that Jesus is dead. Michonne rips off her blindfold and tells her 
"No more bullshit!"


Daryl, Michonne and Tara interrogate the girl. She claims to not have a name and that her group were good people just trying to survive. Michonne asks if her people know about Hilltop but the girl begs to be left alone. Outside, Michonne tells Daryl and Tara she's heading back to Alexandria. Tara agrees and tells her she's going to allow Magna's group to stay because it's what Jesus would have done. Michonne secretly reminds Daryl that he knows what to do if the girl keeps refusing to talk.

Afterward, Daryl scolds Henry for behaving stupidly and reminds him he has one more night left in the cell before he can be released. Michonne then informs Daryl that he should stay at Hilltop to help Tara and suggests he lead the effort in questioning the girl to ensure they don't lose anyone else.

A while later, a funeral is held for Jesus and everyone take turns hammering the nails in his coffin. Daryl looks in sadness, before rushing back to the jail to demand the girl to reveal her identity. Henry tries to intervene but Daryl shuts him down. He slams her against the bars and asks if she comes from a place with walls. She tells him that places like Hilltop never last and her mom told her they needed the dead to stay safe. He raises his knife to her and demands why her people killed his and she says they were always going to, that's what they do. She tells him her mother is out there alone but he calls her a liar before dragging her towards the exit. She begs for her life and he lets her cower back in her cell.

Daryl then reminds Henry of his place and warns he'll stay in that cell until he realizes it. After he leaves, the girl thanks Henry for saving her and introduces herself as 
Lydia
. Outside, next to a window, Daryl listens in.



"
Omega
"


In Hilltop, Daryl sits by a window outside the cell and listens to Lydia telling Henry how she survived with her parents at the start of the apocalypse. He is then left in thought as Lydia tells Henry her mother is not someone you want to mess with.

Later, Daryl runs inside the cells to take Henry out after he tells Lydia about the Kingdom. Outside, Daryl scolds him for endangering his family and reveals he has been using him to get information out of her. Henry lashes out, believing Lydia to be a good person who got messed up. He calls Daryl an asshole and tells him to get the information himself.

Daryl goes back to Lydia's cell and offers her medicine to help with her ear, but she refuses. He tells her that Luke and Alden are missing, but she says she knows nothing about it. He then asks her if her mom would kill their people if she crossed them. Lydia says that she would if she had to and tells him how her mother had to kill a man who was panicking and scared. Daryl says to Lydia that her mom did what she had to keep her alive. Lydia again pulls at her ear and Daryl tosses her the medicine, reminding her the people at Hilltop will help her if she helps them. She asks him for water and when he gets close she tries grabbing him. He grabs her arm and pulls up her sleeve, revealing a series of cut marks, causing her to retreat in the corner. Daryl looks at her for a moment and then leaves.

At night, Daryl visits Lydia again to find out more about her bruises. She says she got them from her mom, so Daryl asks why she won't tell her where she is. He says she's safer here than out there but she disagrees and says her mother's abuse makes her hard. Daryl calls it bullshit, but Lydia says staying soft makes you die and tells him that her father was weak and died saving her. Lydia then tells him that he is strong and doesn't belong in Hilltop. Daryl says she doesn't know shit about him and leaves.

Outside, Henry confronts Daryl but he claims Lydia is Tara's problem now. Henry realizes that Daryl was most likely abused himself, which Daryl doesn't confirm but doesn't deny it either. Henry tells him that he overheard Carol telling Ezekiel that she kept her hair short because Ed used to pull it and abuse her when it was long. He guesses that it took her this long to feel safe again. Daryl listens in thought as Henry tells him he knows Lydia's people are bad but he doesn't think Lydia's bad. He thinks she's just scared and Daryl can show her there's nothing to be afraid of. Daryl says, 
"Not just me". 
Later
, 
Daryl watches as Henry and Lydia spend time together outside the cells.

In the morning, Daryl finds them holding hands. Lydia asks for the pills, promising not to attack this time. She confesses she was trying to get intel from them and that if her mom did find Luke and Alden then they're probably dead. She then explains her people are always on the move and that her memories were mixed up because her mother lied to her. Lydia confesses her father was caring and her mother was the monster. She then finishes her story by claiming her mother killed her father. Lydia cries and apologizes to Daryl for wasting his time, but he says she didn't and goes outside.  

Outside, Henry follows and asks him why a mom would do that to her kid. Daryl tells him that some people ain't meant to be parents. Henry asks if Lydia can stay. Daryl says they'll see and tells Henry to get Lydia fresh clothes, while he talks to Tara about their camp. Henry tells Daryl that he's glad he and his mom are friends. 

Suddenly, Tara calls out to him and Magna below to join her and Yumiko on the guard post. In front of the gate, 
Alpha
 leads a group of Whisperers. She introduces herself and tells them she just wants her daughter back.

At Hilltop, Daryl listens as Alpha and the Whisperers wait for them to bring Lydia to her. Daryl asks them to leave and Alpha signals for more Whisperers to show up. Magna asks Alpha if they killed their people. Alpha says no and promises if they don't bring her Lydia there will be conflict. Daryl then decides to walk outside to talk to Alpha face to face. 

Daryl walks outside and Alpha instructs one of her people to bring someone. Daryl informs Alpha he's ready to fight her people to ensure she doesn't get Lydia back, when he then spots one of the Whisperers with a baby. Alpha explains they're animals and 
"animals have babies."
 Suddenly, a couple of whisperers bring up a tied up 
Alden
 and 
Luke
. Alpha offers to trade both of them for her daughter. 

Inside, Daryl informs Enid he's going to make the trade when Magna says Lydia and Henry are missing. He tells everyone to split up and find them. He gives their scent to Dog and sends him off. Suddenly, he discovers Henry and Lydia escaped and decides to look for them. 
Addy
 says she knows where they went, so she and Enid head out to find them while Daryl stalls. 

Meanwhile, 
Connie
 runs out of the cornfield, sling-shots a walker, and grabs the baby to save it from a nearby herd. The Whisperers around her unsheathe blades as Connie escapes back into the cornfield. Daryl runs in and kills the walkers around her while 
Kelly
, 
Tammy
, and 
Earl
 step in to rescue her. Later, Lydia and Henry return to Hilltop and Daryl goes outside to make the trade.

Outside, Daryl hands Lydia over to Alpha in exchange for Alden and Luke, who are embraced by Enid and Magna's group. Lydia apologizes to her mother and Alpha smacks her across the face, ordering her to address her as Alpha like everyone else. She then smiles at Daryl as they leave. Later, Henry tells Daryl that what they did isn't right, but Daryl reminds him they had to and they just have to live with it.

At night, Daryl sits alone when Addy hands him a note from Henry, where he says he left to find Lydia. Nearby, Connie sits on a table and stops Daryl, writing him a note, claiming that she wants to tag along. He reluctantly agrees and they set off.



"
Guardians

In the woods, Daryl and Connie look for Henry and realize that the Whisperers caught up with him. They kill some walkers and Daryl orders his dog to bring him the bolt back, but he refuses. Connie smiles as Daryl calls him a bad dog. Later, he and Connie watch from some bushes as some Whisperers draw a herd to devour some corpses.

At night, Daryl and Connie, dressed as Whisperers, lure the herd into the Whisperers' camp. In the middle of the chaos, Daryl and Connie grab Henry, who grabs Lydia, and together they escape.



"
Chokepoint
"


In the woods, following their daring escape from the Whisperers, Daryl blames Lydia for getting them into this mess and says she can't go with them back to Hilltop. Connie and Henry refuse to leave her behind and run off with her in another direction. Daryl reluctantly follows them.

At dawn, Daryl and Connie devise a plan to use an office building as a means of separating the Whisperers from the undead. Lydia warns Daryl that Alpha's going to send Beta, who's their best fighter. 
"We'll kill him first"
, Daryl promises. Inside the office building, Connie reveals to Daryl that her group used the building to hide supplies and they argue about how they should proceed afterwards, with Connie saying Lydia should come back with them because they have more to lose than her.

Later, Lydia spots a group of walkers/whisperers emerge from the bushes. In the middle of the group is Beta, who quietly instructs his people to spread out as Daryl shoots one of them with his crossbow. Beta and his people break in and quickly discover a trap meant to separate them from the dead. Meanwhile, Daryl makes Lydia hide in a closet as the Whisperers creep upstairs.

Daryl aims his crossbow at the main door, which gets busted down by 
Beta
, who's using another door as a shield. Daryl regroups and he strikes 
a Whisperer
 through a tarp with a fire axe while Connie and Henry hunt down the others. Daryl slits 
Zion
's throat, before he is bull-rushed by Beta, whose size startles him. The two size each other up and Beta forces Daryl's neck towards a blade, but he manages to punch him and break free. Beta returns with a punch of his own and Daryl stabs him in the chest before escaping into the trap door. Beta grabs the knife out of his chest and announces all he wants is Lydia. Daryl sneaks up through the crawl space behind him and pushes him down the elevator shaft. He spites down and grabs his knife.

Afterward, Connie draws the herd away with her slingshot and Daryl tells the others they're headed to Alexandria to get Henry help because it's closer. However, he doesn't intend to stay and they will instead keep moving on.



"
Scars
"


In a flashback to at least eight months after Rick's presumed death, Daryl finds Michonne in the riverbank and tells her he followed the river to the ocean but hasn't found Rick. Michonne asks when he's going to return to Alexandria, but he says when he finds something.

In the present, Daryl arrives at Alexandria with Henry, Lydia, and Connie. From a guardpost, Michonne tells him she's skeptical of Lydia but he assures her she's on their side. Inside, Daryl tells Michonne they should head to Kingdom soon. Later, nearby the lake, Judith tells Daryl she's happy he helped Lydia and suggests they could all defeat the Whisperers if they came together since it's what her dad would have done.

At night, Daryl, Henry, and Lydia prepare to leave for the Kingdom. Michonne tells Daryl Judith's still mad at her so he suggests he tell her the truth. 
"That's not just a little kid you got there,"
 he says. 

In the past, Daryl joins Michonne in her mission to find Judith and the missing Alexandrians in the woods. During a break, Michonne laments how stupid she was to trust her old friend, but Daryl reminds her some people just have too much evil in their heart. A while later, Michonne and Daryl spot one Jocelyn's kids outside of an abandoned school. They chase him until they're met by all of the kids in a hallway. One of them shoots Daryl in the shoulder with an arrow while Linus knocks Michonne unconscious. 

Sometime later, they wake up bloodied and tied to a pipe. Linus painfully brands an iron X on Daryl and Jocelyn tells Michonne the kids can't be soft. Winnie then brands Michonne as she shrieks in pain. When they are left alone, Daryl and Michonne break free and split up. A while later, Daryl emerges from the school and watches in confusion at the children killed by Michonne, but smiles as Judith emerges from the trailer and happily embraces her mom. Later, Daryl and Michonne return to Alexandria with the kids as the parents rush up to greet them.

In the present, Daryl, Connie, Henry, and Lydia encounter Michonne and Judith in the woods and join them on their way towards the Kingdom.



"
The Calm Before
"


Daryl and the group arrive at the Kingdom as the fair starts. Carol scolds Henry for running away and then hugs Daryl. As everyone catches up, Tara spots Lydia among the group. 
"The plan was to bring Henry…just Henry"
 Tara says angrily to Daryl. Additionally, Ezekiel and Carol offer Daryl a home at the Kingdom which he promises to consider.

Inside the theater, Daryl listens as the leaders reunite and decide to grant asylum to Lydia in Alexandria, send some soldiers to Hilltop to guard against any potential attacks from the Whisperers and to re-establish the charter. He then sees as they all sign the charter.

Later that day, Daryl, Carol, Michonne, Magna, and others prepare to leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. He says goodbye to Connie and tells her to look after his dog until he returns. In the woods, he and the rest encounter Ozzy, Alek, and D.J. and find one of Hilltop's carts overturned. He, Michonne, Carol, and Yumiko decide to track any possible survivor. 

At night, Daryl and the group gets attacked by walkers. They take them out one by one until the Whisperers surround them. Beta emerges from the trees and tells them to drop their weapons. 
"You just had to give me the girl,"
 he growls at Daryl, telling him their deal is off. After the group is tied up, Alpha approaches them and tells them she ran into trouble on the road as she wipes her bloody knife on her pants. Michonne warns her if she tries to get Lydia back they'll respond in force, but Alpha assures her Lydia isn't her concern anymore. She takes out a shotgun and orders Daryl to follow her. 

At dawn, Alpha forces Daryl to the top of a cliff where a massive horde of walkers and Whisperers walk beneath them. Alpha says Daryl's communities are a joke and that her way of life is best for her people. She then tells him his friends at the camp are fine, but the next time his people cross into her land she'll release the horde into theirs. She clarifies she marked the border and Daryl asks if she killed Lydia. Alpha tells Daryl she didn't and doubts he can protect her. He tells her she's wrong and leaves. 

On their way back to the Kingdom, Daryl, Michonne, Carol, and Yumiko find a beaten and bloody Siddiq tied to a tree. He points them to a nearby hill, which has ten pikes in the ground. Each spike has a severed head stabbed through the top. The group walk devastated towards it and look in horror at the victims: Ozzy, Alek, D.J., Frankie, Tammy, Rodney, Addy, Enid, Tara, and Henry. Daryl comforts Carol and tells her to look away, but she is overwhelmed with emotion. They then put down their friends and loved ones and head back to the Kingdom.

Later that day, Daryl listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.  

Sometime later, Daryl and Lydia return to the border. Lydia leaves the necklace Henry made for her on the ground and as the two walk away, snow flurries begin to fall.



"
The Storm
"


Several months after the fair massacre, Daryl has become a fatherly figure to Lydia, protecting and caring for her. In the Kingdom, as everyone gets ready to leave and move to Hilltop, he makes dinner for Lydia.

On the road, the group spots walkers in a field but keep moving undetected. Suddenly, Alden asks Lydia if they're her people. 
"We followed their rules, haven't they done enough to us?"
 but is shut up by Daryl. Lydia tells him, 
"I don't want to cause any more problems,"
 but Daryl reminds her people should stop blaming her.

Later, as it becomes colder, Daryl reminds Carol that Henry wanted Lydia to be with them. She admits all she can see is Henry when she looks at her and Daryl asks what she sees when she looks at him. She assures him she just sees him and puts her hand on his shoulder. A while later, Daryl and Carol kill a couple of walkers. He tells the group to keep moving as he and Ezekiel go to retrieve his bolt. In the woods, Ezekiel tells Daryl he wants a fresh start with Carol at Hilltop 
"it would be easier if it was just us."
 Daryl doesn't say anything and looks at him in thought. As more snow starts falling, Michonne decides to take the group to Sanctuary.

In the Sanctuary, Daryl sits with Carol and she asks him if something happened back there between him and Ezekiel. He says no, but Carol's suspicious. She admits with Henry gone she feels like she's losing herself again, so Daryl offers to take Lydia away and protect her on his own, even though he doesn't want to leave.

A while later, Daryl listens as the leaders map their route through a frozen lake on Alpha's land and Michonne warns they have to leave now or they won't make it. The group gets ready and leaves the Sanctuary.

In the woods, the group passes the pikes into Alpha's territory. Michonne kills frozen walkers, unsure if they're Whisperers or not, before reaching the frozen lake. Daryl notices Lydia's missing again, so Carol leaves to find her and instructs him to get everyone across safely. Suddenly, walkers awaken from the snow banks and the group kills them one by one before escaping across the ice.

In the morning, Daryl and the group finally arrive at Hilltop, where he knocks off the head of a frozen walker. That night, he informs Lydia they'll leave for Alexandria in the morning. She asks why he left Hilltop and he says he'll tell her that story another day. The next day, Daryl, Michonne, and the others return to Alexandria, along with Carol and several Kingdom refugees. He then plays with the group in a snowball fight.

Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Daryl and the Coalition form a militia in order to train the several residents of the communities to face any future treats. He also has been learning ASL in order to communicate better with Connie.

On the training day, Daryl watches as the militia exercise on the Oceanside beach. Later on, Daryl and Michonne laud the results of their training session. 
"Tara would have been proud,"
 Daryl says. They also comment Rick would've loved the fact that the children are seeing the beach for the first time. A while later, Daryl listens as Aaron radios Gabriel at Alexandria to warn him about the recently discovered Whisperer mask at the beach. As Michonne leads a group to look for more signs of the Whisperers, Daryl decides to stay and wait for Carol's return.

Daryl walks by the beach and waves at Connie and Kelly after Dog runs over to them. As he waits on a dock, Ezekiel talks about his time working in the zoo and reveals he was scared of birds back then. Connie comes up and delivers Dog to Daryl with a note saying, 
"Think you lost something."
 He communicates with her in ASL and she tells him that he signs with a southern accent. Suddenly, Carol arrives on a boat. She awkwardly greets Ezekiel and quickly moves on to talk to Daryl, who lifts her up in a hug.

As they walk around the camp, Carol tells Daryl about her travels. He thinks she is looking for Alpha, but Carol claims to be happy that the past is behind them. Daryl then informs her of the mask they found and asks if she wants to help them look but she declines, telling him she's only here temporarily. Daryl then drives the two of them off on his motorcycle. In the woods, Daryl and Carol try to hunt a deer in the woods. They follow it as it stumbles into one of the borders. Daryl stops Carol from shooting the injured deer as walkers devour it. Daryl rules that it is across a border and they shouldn't pursue it. Carol angrily reminds him they never agreed to the border.

Afterward, Daryl apologizes and the two make up. He admits he doesn't want her to leave again on a boat, calling her his best friend. 
"Best friend, what are you, 10?",
 Carol jokes and suggests they make friendship bracelets. She then proposes they run away together. Suddenly, an explosion rings out in the sky.

That night, Daryl and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. The group runs out of water as a herd of walkers approaches the group. With their backs to the fire, the group prepares for a fight.

Daryl and the group take their formations and start fighting off the herd. As they keep killing the walkers, Daryl tosses an axe to cut a tree down and have it fall to some walkers. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers. He and Carol walk to the cliff where Alpha showed him the Whisperers' herd. Carol still wants to run away tomorrow, but Daryl wants her to stay and proceeds to walk back to the camp.

We Are the End of the World

Daryl is remembered by Frances when he questioned Alpha as to why she brought a baby to their confrontation in a flashback to the time she brought her son to the Hilltop in search of Lydia.

Ghosts
"


Daryl and the rest of the Alexandria residents face against waves of walkers pouring onto the community gates over the next 49 hours. After prevailing from the exhausting battle, the community discovers that a new herd of walkers is approaching from multiple directions. In the morning, Daryl helps to clean up the community from the corpses while Eugene warns that it will be an hour until the next wave hits. Michonne is tired and Daryl feels her frustration. Suddenly, Gamma arrives at the gate to tell them to go to the north border, lay down their weapons, and wait for Alpha. Michonne asks her to call off her walkers but she swears they're not theirs. 

Later that day at an emergency council meeting, Daryl reaffirms that he saw tens of thousands of walkers in Alpha's herd. Michonne tells everyone instead of retaliating, she and a small group will meet with Alpha at the border to work things out. That night, Daryl, Michonne, Carol, and a few others arrive at the border and lay down their weapons. Alpha arrives with some Whisperers and reminds them to stay off her land. Michonne explains the fire would have wiped out Oceanside and they only crossed one time, but Alpha reminds her of two other times they trespassed. Alpha declares that there will be no bloodshed, and instead announces she's moving the border up as punishment. Carol says they don't have to listen to her bullshit.

Daryl tries to get her to leave but Alpha says not until Carol lowers her eyes to her feet. Alpha tells Carol she should fear her but Carol says she feels nothing at all. Alpha reminds her how Henry feared her before she beheaded him, causing Carol to pull out her gun and shoot. Daryl manages to hit her arm so she misses as the Whisperers draw their weapons. Michonne apologizes to Alpha for Carol's behavior and Alpha says she forgives her "mother to mother." Back in their camp, Carol tells Michonne, 
"Bitch has to die."
 Daryl tells Michonne she hasn't been the same since the boat. Suddenly, Daryl and the others hear Carol shooting and she claims she spotted some Whisperers nearby.

After searching around the woods, Michonne suggests to Carol that the pills she is taking is affecting her, but Carol brushes it off. The group then arrives at an abandoned school to rest. Carol decides to keep watch while everyone sleeps. Once her shift ends, Daryl finds her and she claims to be fine. Carol insists that this isn't like the story of his trucker dad but a confused Daryl says he never told her anything. Daryl volunteers to take her shift but Carol says she wants to keep watch one more hour. 

A while later, Daryl and the others hear Carol's cries for help and enter the gymnasium to find her standing on top of several walkers she has killed. He and the rest decide to head back to Alexandria so Carol can be treated at the infirmary and rest properly. After Siddiq and Dante inform Daryl and Michonne Carol's doing well, they take her home so she can sleep. The next morning, Carol asks Daryl if he believes her about the Whisperers and he says he does. 



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Daryl joins Michonne and her children as they dine together and share a laugh. He then takes a tray of food to Carol's room but leaves it outside when she doesn't answer. The following morning, Daryl is left in charge of 
R.J.
 as Michonne leads a convoy to Hilltop. While looking for Lydia, he finds her talking with Negan and orders her to leave. 
"She's just trying to fit in,"
 Negan says. Daryl tells him that won't happen with him being around her. He catches up with Lydia to scold her for talking to him, when they notice a "Silence the Whispers" message graffitied on their house door.

Later that day, Daryl talks with Lydia and tells her to not do things like gutting animals in front of the residents. She defends herself and storms out, causing Daryl to blame his lack of understanding of a teen. That night, Daryl comes to Lydia's aid after she is attacked. As the residents realize 
Margo
 is dead, Daryl crouches down to hug Lydia and orders Negan back to his cell despite Lydia's protests that he didn't do anything wrong. He then has Lydia taken to the infirmary to be treated and bandaged. When Daryl checks on Lydia, he tells her he's sorry for what happened, and she claims that her father would've protected her. Daryl hugs her and she tells him Negan saved her. 

A while later, Daryl visits Negan at this cell to talk with him. He tells Negan people want him dead but Negan claims it was an accident and Margo was an asshole anyway for beating on a kid. Daryl asks why he helped Lydia and Negan says he believes in their way of life. Daryl promises he'll get a chance to tell his side and leaves. He encounters Carol outside his house in a better state. She asks what he's going to do about Negan. 
"I believe her,"
 he says. Carol reminds him the real enemy is still out there, and says that they should have gone to New Mexico.

Daryl radios Michonne later that night to update her on the situation. Michonne asks if she should come home but Daryl tells her to stay as long as Hilltop needs her. Michonne tells him Lydia has to be protected regardless of the outcome because she believes Alpha will be harsher with them if Lydia's gone, reminding Daryl was chosen by Alpha to be Lydia's protector. She also asks Daryl to be her proxy on the council's vote regarding Negan. Daryl checks in with the council and says he believes Lydia, which ties the vote. Gabriel announces he'll take the night to make his decision by tomorrow.

The following morning, Daryl is informed by Gabriel that Negan has escaped. He then rushes over the basement to find Lydia has locked herself in. Daryl tells her she didn't leave the house that night. However, Lydia chooses to stay in the cell because she feels safer and laments she couldn't be like him. Daryl leaves in sadness and then starts to wash off the graffiti off the walls around the community. 



"
What It Always Is
"


Daryl and Siddiq travel to Hilltop following their search for Negan to check on the community. Upon informing Ezekiel they hadn't had any luck finding Negan, Daryl wonders if he is going to ask about Carol, but Ezekiel declines and leaves. He then notices as Connie is informed by the Hilltop hunting group that Kelly chose to stay in the woods. 

Later that day, Daryl and Connie search for Kelly around the woods. As Connie grows worried for her sister, Daryl tells her a story about how he saved Merle from drowning during a fishing trip but was chastised for not getting the beer off the lake. They laugh over the story and hold hands. Suddenly, Dog finds the remains of a boar. They hear a noise behind them and find Magna. 

Sometime later, the group manages to find an exhausted Kelly lying under a tree. As they give her water, Kelly insists to Magna they tell Daryl and Connie about the supplies they've been taking. Daryl is mad about them hiding the supplies and Connie suggests they lie and say they found it in the woods. When the group later arrives back at Hilltop, Daryl looks in disappointment at Magna for her actions.  

That night, Daryl prepares his bike to head back to Alexandria with Siddiq when Connie arrives to apologize for involving him with Kelly and Magna's lie. He claims to understand because they are her family. She says she considers him family too. Daryl smiles before leaving the community on his bike.

Bonds
"


Daryl is outside on the porch with his dog smoking a cigarette. He sees Carol leaving and catches up, inquiring where she is going. Carol claims she wants to do another sweep looking for Negan, and Daryl offers to tag along. She reluctantly accepts. While traveling, the two discuss the possibility of Negan crossing the border and joining the Whisperers. Carol stops short of a clearing near the Whisperer border and pulls out a pair of binoculars. When Daryl presses her for the real reason they came there, Carol reveals that she wants to find Alpha's horde and destroy it.

Carol tells Daryl that she's been tracking walker movements along the border, and that they all arrive at the area where they're currently at. She wants to observe the clearing for Whisperer activity, and see where they're taking the walkers. Daryl cautions that they won't be able to follow them without starting a war, but Carol claims they will only watch them and report to the Alexandria council before doing anything. Daryl then asks why she lied to him about their mission earlier; Carol tells him she didn't want him to worry about her after she pulled a gun on Alpha, and apologizes. She asks Daryl if he will stick around, and he confirms, claiming that she will need him to track.

Later that day, Daryl and Carol pass the time by throwing acorns at a can. Daryl hits it, but Carol says he has to knock it over. Carol finds a double-capped acorn and gives it to Daryl, telling him it's good luck and might improve his aim. He puts in his vest pocket. Carol then asks how things were at Hilltop. Daryl says Ezekiel sends his best. When Carol asks him how Connie is, Daryl tells her that there is nothing at all going on between them. Carol asks him why not and tells him he can't hide out with his dog forever, but he doesn't answer. The two share a meal before spotting a group of walkers roaming around in circles, quickly concluding there is a Whisperer among them.

Daryl and Carol are still observing the growing Whisperer herd. Carol points out that it will be tougher to track them at night. Daryl deduces that she wants to cross the border, and she confirms, if that's what it takes to destroy the horde. Daryl asks if she's sure she doesn't just want to take another shot at Alpha, but Carol says the horde is their shot. She asks if he is changing his mind, but he denies this and tells her they need to be smart during the mission, since they will endanger everyone if they mess up. When Carol excuses herself to go to the bathroom Daryl searches her bag, but doesn't find anything of note. Upon returning, Carol asks if he found what he was looking for. Daryl asks if she brought a gun like last time, but she denies this. They then head off to track the herd.

Before crossing the border, Daryl tells Carol not to leave tracks or kill walkers, since the Whisperers will know they were there if they do. He also tells her that if things go wrong, they will head back immediately, to which she agrees. That night, they observe the Whisperer herd from some shrubbery. Daryl signals Carol to retreat, but she ignores him. She then accidentally steps on a branch, which alerts the walkers and the Whisperer corralling them to their location. Daryl gets into a struggle with a walker, but manages to snap its neck. He then disembowels it and smears its guts over himself, camouflaging himself from the rest of the herd. 

Daryl later meets up with Carol and discovers that she has taken a Whisperer hostage. Carol claims that she didn't have a choice as the Whisperer spotted her, and suggests interrogating him. Daryl becomes skeptical of Carol's intentions and asks if she planned this, but Carol denies the accusation. When she pulls the Whisperer up, Daryl notices that his hands are zip-tied together and wonders where Carol got the zip-ties since they weren't in her bag. Carol claims that Daryl must have missed them. They then leave towards Alexandria.



"
Open Your Eyes
"


Daryl and Carol bring the captured Whisperer to the cell to be locked up. He signals Lydia to get out while Carol escorts the prisoner inside. Outside, Daryl watches as Carol questions Lydia about the captive and as Gabriel orders that the Whisperer's wounds be treated first as well as demanding to be present during the interrogation. Upon arriving at this house, Daryl sets the double acorn down and takes off his shirt. He then cuddles with his Dog on the couch. 

A while later, Daryl is present during the Whisperer's interrogation and watches as he spits food onto Carol's face and then is punched by her after a discriminatory remark. 
"You're all weak,"
 he tells them in response. Daryl pulls out a knife and threatens to cut off his fingers, ears, and teeth. The Whisperer says they are lying to themselves and he wouldn't betray Alpha because she loves her people so much she sacrificed her own daughter. The group is left surprised at this revelation. Carol sprints out of the cell and Daryl catches her, begging her not to involve Lydia because she has been trough enough. 
"This is the only way and you know it,"
 she says in response.

Later that day, Daryl arrives along with the others at the cell to help the Whisperer who suddenly starts convulsing. When Dante holds him, he spits blood onto his shoulder before dying from the poison. Carol and Lydia enter the room but Daryl tries to shield the view and has them leave. He then looks in suspicion as Siddiq blames Dante for treating him with hemlock plants despite him claiming innocence and accusing him of packing it. Shortly after, Daryl prevents the Whisperer from reanimating and Gabriel offers to help him hide the body. 



"
The World Before
"


Daryl is present during Dante's interrogation in the infirmary after his identity as a Whisperer spy is exposed. He punches Dante several times in retaliation for killing Siddiq and for trying to kill Rosita the previous night. When Dante confesses his motive for infiltrating the community and says he's looking forward to them arguing over what to do with him as they did with Negan, Daryl looks at him in anger. Shortly after, he and Carol update Aaron on the recent events.

When Aaron reveals to them that he has been talking with a Whisperer and she has told him the location of Alpha's horde in exchange for seeing her nephew Adam, Daryl orders him to summon a group from Hilltop to help them with the mission before suggesting Carol to stay. When he reminds her Lydia is still missing, Carol says she can help him look for her afterwards even though she doesn't want to be found. 
"Are we talking about her or we talking about you?"
, he asks her as she leaves. Later that day, Daryl attends the funeral service for Siddiq and listens to Gabriel's religious remarks. He silently pays his respects and then carries R.J. away from the ceremony.

Daryl then goes alongside Carol and Aaron to the woods to meet up with the group from Hilltop. He greets Connie and thanks her for helping. That night, Daryl stops Carol from stepping on a bear trap. He chastises her for acting recklessly and says they can't let Alpha take way their future too. They hug and then cross the border. The next day, the group arrives at the location of the horde in a clearing only to find it's empty. Daryl tells Aaron it was a waste of time and now they will go search for Lydia. When Carol chases after Alpha into a dark building, Daryl and the others follow her inside. The group then falls below a cave into a trap where they find themselves surrounded by most of the horde.



"
Squeeze
"


Having become trapped in the cave with the horde, Daryl and the group recover from the fall and realize Alpha is watching them from the top as they look around for a possible exit. He watches as Carol screams in anger and then helps Magna as she tries to climb a wall in vain. The group starts seeking other avenues of escape and eventually they decide to jump from rock to rock onto the other side of the cave in order to find another exit.

As the group moves through the cave, Daryl points out that Carol has claustrophobia. He also reminds Magna that they don't have time to blame each other and they have to work together. Shortly after, he tells Carol he's tired of her reckless actions and wants her to stop seeking revenge. She answers that she wants Alpha to suffer for all she's done, but Daryl reminds her that they're not fighting for vengeance, but for their future. Carol promises she won't fool him anymore. 

When Magna is ambushed by a Whisperer, the group engages in a fight and kills several Whisperers, before deciding to follow the ones who escaped to find the exit. They follow the path and squeeze trough narrow tunnels until they find an underground mine station where Kelly discovers a box of dynamite. As the group starts digging for a way out, Daryl notices that both Carol and one dynamite stick are gone. He finds her all the way back, trying to climb a wall and find a good place for the stick to explode and destroy the horde. Daryl says she'll kill herself in the process and eventually convinces her to stop. He then tries to pull her up but the dynamite falls and explodes underneath them.

The cave begins collapsing and Daryl helps an injured Carol as they try to return to the others. Connie and Magna rescue and help them escape as Jerry holds a beam to prevent it from collapsing. Magna and Connie stay back and kill several Whisperers to protect Jerry, but he cannot hold the log anymore and leaves through the hole. The rest of the dynamite immediately explodes and the cave implodes, trapping Magna and Connie inside.

Daryl tries to excavate trough the debris as Kelly falls to the ground in agony. Aaron tells Daryl it could take weeks to reach them as he starts to sob. Kelly states that the explosion will attract walkers and Whisperers in the vicinity and they should leave because they won't be able to help Connie and Magna if they die. Carol rants to Daryl, blaming herself for all their troubles and pleads him to admit that it's all her fault. He ignores her request and tells the group to head home and inform everyone they found the horde, while he'll find the other entrance to the cave.



"
Stalker
"


While looking for another entrance to the cave, Daryl finds a Whisperer walking around and prepares to attack, but is forced to hide when Alpha walks out of the cave with the horde. He later ambushes and manages to kill her Whisperers escorts as they are passing by a river. The duo then engages in a fight where Alpha slices his face under the eyes, worsening his vision with blood. In response, Daryl thrusts a tree branch in her shoulder and yells for Magna and Connie's whereabouts. The fight draws nearby walkers' attention and Daryl is forced to take them out while dealing with his clouded vision. He is suddenly stabbed in the leg by Alpha and they flee from the scene separately.

Daryl retreats to an abandoned gas station and hides while struggling to pull out the knife from his leg. When Alpha arrives and attracts the attention of walkers, he is forced to rip the knife from his leg to kill the last one, thus opening his wound and losing a lot of blood. That night, Daryl remains bleeding out on the floor and taunts Alpha by saying she drove Lydia away because she didn't love her before eventually passing out from exhaustion. He is then rescued by Lydia and somehow taken to a part in the woods where he has his wounds patched and remains under her care. When Daryl awakens the next day, Lydia updates him and admits she couldn't kill her mother.



"
Morning Star
"


Daryl and Lydia arrive at the Hilltop. The pair reveal that Alpha is coming. Daryl and Lydia joins the discussion about what should be done. Lydia thinks they should run, explaining that even if the explosion at the cave took out half the horde, Alpha would still have thousands of walkers left. 
Earl
 thinks the Whisperers might bypass them and go for Alexandria first, but Lydia negates this. 
Jerry
 wishes to stay and fight instead, while 
Dianne
 agrees with Lydia, believing that they can rebuild in another location. Earl is skeptical, however, and reckons that they will never find a place as good as Hilltop. While 
Yumiko
 points out they're heavily outnumbered, Earl insists that fighting is the best course of action, and even if they die, they will die for a place that means something. Aaron points out that there are children at Hilltop, too. 

Daryl agrees that they should get the kids out first, and instructs the others to pack up and regroup at 
Oceanside
. As the children climb into the wagon, Judith expresses a desire to stay and fight, but Daryl is quick to rebuff her. He then spots Carol and Ezekiel arriving, but doesn't go to greet them. The caravan doesn't make it far before they hit a roadblock and discover 
Felix
 and 
Penny
 (the scouts they sent earlier) dead. Daryl identifies this as one of Negan's tactics and concludes that all the other roads will be blocked, too, making a retreat impossible.

The caravan returns to the Hilltop, with Daryl informing the others of the situation. Luke suggests calling Alexandria for reinforcements, but Dianne doesn't think that neither Alexandria nor Oceanside can get to them in time. Earl is confident that Hilltop is prepared, and tries to rally everyone for the upcoming conflict.

Downstairs, Ezekiel is fastening his armor when Daryl approaches him. Noticing the lumps on Ezekiel's neck, Daryl asks if he's okay. "Nah, I got cancer.", Ezekiel replies, but goes on to state "But that's okay, you know what I'm saying?". Daryl says that he's sorry for this, and acknowledges that while he and Ezekiel never really got along, he and the others are nonetheless glad to have him. Ezekiel thanks Daryl for his kind words. The two proceed to arrange for the other to get the children out in case one of them falls in battle. 

When Ezekiel leaves, Daryl notices Judith sitting on the sofa and wonders why she isn't with the other kids. Judith insists that she can fight. Daryl says that he knows she can, and apologizes for Judith seeing the bodies of Felix and Penny earlier that day. Judith dismisses them as "just walkers", which she has killed plenty of. Judith claims that she isn't scared, but when Daryl says that he might be, she says that she might be scared for R.J., her mom, and Daryl. Daryl assures her that there is no shame in that, since she knows what she's fighting for. Judith reveals that she repaired the wing on Daryl's vest. Daryl thanks her for the gift, before making her promise that if Ezekiel comes looking for her, she goes with him, regardless of whether she knows where Daryl is. Judith promises after some hesitation, and the two hug each other goodbye. 

Outside, Carol approaches Daryl and asks him to not hate her. Daryl assures her that he is never going to hate her, before taking his leave. He grabs a 
morning star
 and heads out for battle.

As everyone is gathered on the front lines, Daryl walks out to join the army. They are standing at the gate with their shields. Daryl takes the lead. Kelly confirms that the horde is close. Indeed, the horde soon emerges from the bushes and approaches the Hilltop. While they are momentarily halted by the electric fence, the walkers soon break through it and approach the second line of defense. Aaron orders the survivors to split ranks. The shield-wielding survivors reinforce the makeshift barbed wire fence, while the melee weapon-wielding survivors start taking out the walkers. The archers, meanwhile, stay in the back and rain arrows on the herd. 

Behind the herd, Beta commands the Whisperers to launch the sap they collected earlier using makeshift catapults into the front lines, drenching most of the defenders as well as the Hilltop's walls. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltop resident ablaze. With no choice, Daryl tells the defenders to begin to retreat towards the Hilltop, but are trapped when the Whisperers launch another volley of fire-arrows into the Hilltop's walls, setting the community ablaze.



"
Walk With Us
"


The survivors have retreated behind the Hilltop's walls, while the fire continues to spread, now engulfing most of the Barrington House. With the gates down, the herd begins to pour into the Hilltop, while the survivors desperately try to hold them off. Daryl is forced to retreat when the herd closes in on them.

Daryl, Rosita, Dianne, Jerry, Nabila, and a few others make their way to the rendezvous where Ezekiel should be waiting for them with the kids. Once there, however, they discover the house to be empty, save for a lone walker. Nabila despairs about the whereabouts of her and Jerry's children.

Daryl and Jerry travel back to the ruins of Hilltop, and discover Ezekiel still alive under some debris. Ezekiel tells them that Earl has the kids. When Daryl, Ezekiel, and Jerry approach the cabin, they are relieved to find all of the kids alive. Further inside, Daryl discovers Judith sitting next to Earl's body, having just killed his reanimated corpse. Daryl sits next to her and hugs her in comfort.



"
What We Become
"


Daryl only appears in Michonne's hallucinations. In one of them, Michonne sees Daryl on a road and begs for his help. Upon spotting her, Daryl tells the others to move on and drives away. 

Michonne, after becoming Negan's right hand, confronts and taunts Daryl and the others once they are captured by the Saviors in the forest. She executes Abraham using Lucille while Daryl watches.

During the war, Daryl is also seen when Michonne finds herself being pursued through a forest by the Militia. She kills two of them, before she is abruptly shot in the chest by Daryl with his crossbow. Daryl keeps his crossbow trained on her as she feebly tries to recover her weapon. Rick approaches her and shoots her in the head with his Colt Python.



"
Look at the Flowers
"


Daryl first appears at the lone cabin where Negan had left Lydia. He attacks Negan, subduing him an demanding to know where Alpha was. Daryl refuses to believe that Negan has killed Alpha, rejecting her walker mask as evidence. When Negan claims to have worked with Carol, Daryl hesitates. Not trusting him after he had attacked Lydia and participated in the destruction of the Hilltop, Daryl binds Negan's hands and orders him to prove that Alpha has been killed. 

Along the way, the two argue about what blame Negan should bear for the death of the others. Daryl, like Carol before him, accuses Negan of having taken his time in dealing with the Whisperers, arguing that his delay had cost lives. He further states that Negan had delayed because he had enjoyed having the power to affect the outcome. When the two of them arrive at the border where Negan had left Alpha's head it is no longer there. Negan begins to plead his case while Daryl keeps his crossbow aimed at Negan. The plead is cut short then they get ambushed by three Whisperers, one of them pointing Alpha's shotgun at Daryl. Knowing that Negan has killed the original Alpha, the Whisperers declare Negan to be their new Alpha. Delighted, Negan has the Whisperers remove his bindings and places them on Daryl. Negan takes the shotgun and forces Daryl to get on his knees. The ex-Savior admits to Daryl that he had enjoyed becoming a Whisperer and becoming Alpha's second, but not for the reasons that Daryl thinks. Daryl sternly suggests that Negan shoot him now, but Negan instead turns and shoots one of the Whisperers in the head. They deal with the other two quickly, Daryl demanding that Negan untie him once done.

The two of them wait until dawn hoping Carol would return. Negan says he doesn't think she will, Daryl looks saddened by this but says he knows. Negan then opens up about why he had done what he had done: Carol had freed him so that he would kill Alpha, but the Whisperers had treated him with respect once he had earned his place. Daryl and the other survivors had kept Negan locked in a cage for seven years and had never once looked at him without contempt. Negan had enjoyed feeling like he had mattered again, but had kept to his personal code as a Savior: never kill those who do not deserve it and never kill children. Daryl says that he still cannot bring himself to like Negan, after which they both head back to Alexandria.

Later that day, Daryl opens the gate at Alexandria for Carol. The two look at each other, but don't say anything. After she enters the community and walks away from him, Daryl closes the gate.



"
The Tower
"


As he is scouting the woods, Daryl attempts to radio Michonne, cautioning her not to return home. He tells her that they have a plan to end the war, and reminisces how being on the run reminds him of the old gang. Alas, he receives no reply. In the woods, Daryl discovers Judith. When he finds out Judith is alone, he tries to take her back to the Tower, but Judith protests that she hates it at the building, as it smells of cat urine, and wants to learn to do what Daryl does instead. Although Daryl is initially resistant to this idea, he eventually agrees to let her tag along. Daryl explains that he is walking the perimeter and looking for anything out of the ordinary, and if he spots something, he retreats and radios it in. He warns Judith that there is no room for mistakes, which she acknowledges.

Daryl coaches Judith to spot things that don't belong. She notices a peace of skin on the side of a tree, and correctly identifies this as coming from a walker. Daryl notes that the Whisperers could be rounding more walkers up, and instructs Judith to stay behind him. It isn't long before they come upon a small group of walkers, led by the same Whisperer Beta threatened earlier. Daryl shoots the Whisperer with his crossbow, injuring her. As the Whisperer runs off, Daryl and Judith dispatch the walkers and quickly give chase.

Daryl and Judith track down the 
injured Whisperer
 to a small ditch. The Whisperer begs Daryl to pull the arrow out of her shoulder, not wanting to die in that manner. Daryl orders her to drop the knife and asks where the rest of the Whisperers are. She quickly reveals their whereabouts, but also that she was going off on her own. When asked why, she claims to have had no choice, revealing that Beta lost his mind after the survivors killed Alpha. Finally, Daryl asks if the Whisperers know the survivors' location, but the Whisperer doesn't know, although she assures Daryl that Beta will keep coming for them. Daryl proceeds to aim his crossbow at the Whisperer's head, as the latter pleads that she wants to "walk after". Daryl repeats his previous question, but the Whisperer genuinely doesn't know. With that, Daryl shoots the Whisperer in the head. Shocked, Judith tells Daryl that he didn't have to kill the Whisperer, but Daryl rationalizes that she didn't have any information and was going to die anyway, so it was better for it to happen quickly. Judith protests leaving the Whisperer, and hypothesizes that she could have a family, but Daryl gently drags her away.

As they are heading back, Judith stops. When Daryl asks what's wrong, Judith once again expresses discomfort at them leaving the Whisperer in a ditch. She asks what would happen if Daryl was lost and no one could find him, or R.J., or her mom. When he asks where this is coming from, Judith states that she simply wishes for everyone to be back together again. Daryl assures her that he radioed Michonne and told her not to come, even though he didn't get a reply. Judith claims that it doesn't matter, as she talked to her mom after the fire, and is worried that Michonne might not come home. Daryl asks what Michonne said, but Judith just says that she went to help some people she met along the way. Judith didn't want to tell Daryl about this, as she was afraid that he'd leave, too. Daryl assures Judith that he won't leave, but refuses to promise anything, as he maintains that he can't lie to Judith, and doesn't know what's going to happen in the future, no more than anyone does. Daryl, however, goes on to state that there are a lot of people back at the Tower who would do anything for her, and will one day need her to do anything for them. Finally, Daryl assures Judith that, while nothing can take the place of a loved one lost, it doesn't mean that everything that follows is going to break your heart. He then embraces her. Just as they are about to head back, Gabriel suddenly radios Daryl, revealing that they are surrounded by Beta's herd.



"
A Certain Doom
"


Daryl and his group just barely make it back to the Tower. At the hospital stairway, Daryl and Carol are setting traps. Daryl tells Carol about Michonne 
leaving
 and how he keeps thinking he's never going to see her again, just like everyone else. Carol reassures him that she is still there. Upstairs, they join the others as Gabriel goes over the plan with the rest of the group. He tells them that the plan remains to lead the 
herd
 away. 
Luke
 explains that he needs to get the sound system he's been making to the wagon, which is on the other side of the herd. Gabriel divides them into four two-man groups, with one carrying the cargo and one protecting. 
Lydia
 offers to help lead them through, but 
Beatrice
 and 
Rachel
 decline, as they don't trust her. Gabriel agrees to keep Lydia in the hospital. Daryl acknowledges that they're not all going to make it, but claims that it's the only way. Kelly volunteers to go with Daryl.

Later on, the group prepares for their mission by rubbing guts on themselves. Daryl notices Negan is clean and questions him about this. Negan says that, with him being Alpha's killer, he'd be a priority target for the Whisperers and especially Beta, so he'd rather stay behind in order to not draw any attention to the others. Daryl doesn't accept this explanation, and thinks Negan just isn't willing to risk his own skin. He then joins the others and prepares to head out. At the exit, Daryl says goodbye to Judith through the separating door. 

As night falls, Daryl and the survivors on the road come under attack from the Whisperers, who use the trailing walkers as meat shields from their arrows. The Whisperers also attack from the woods, killing Oscar and forcing the rest to abandon their wagon. The Whisperers promptly smash the speakers. Daryl radios Gabriel to notify them that the wagon is destroyed, and that the herd is coming back. Daryl then tells lays out his plan to the others: go back and hunt down the Whisperers in the herd one by one. He acknowledges that this isn't a very good plan, but stresses that if they don't do it, all of their people are going to die. When Magna asks how they will deal with the herd, Lydia volunteers to lead them away, since her mother taught her how. Daryl rebuffs her, and Luke points out that she'd have to lead the herd over a cliff, which would be suicide. Lydia, however, is adamant. Daryl decides they will deal with it later, and tells the others to move.

Beta attacks Negan and before he can kill him, he is slashed across the back by Daryl, then stabbed in the eyes as he turns around. Screaming in pain, Beta hallucinates himself pulling the knives out of his eyes as walkers surround and embrace him. His life flashes before his eyes, particularly his time with Alpha. Back in reality, Daryl pulls the knives out of Beta's eyes, as walkers quickly swarm the Whisperer leader. As they rip the mask off his face, Beta dies with a smile. Negan is shocked as he recognizes Beta from before the apocalypse, and asks Daryl if he knows who he is. Daryl coldly says that it was nobody.

Back at the woods around the Tower, everyone is reunited with Maggie, including Judith. Lydia and Carol arrive and inform the group that the herd is finished. Daryl and Carol also talk, as Daryl asks if Carol got what she wanted. She replies that she didn't, but didn't really want it anyway. Daryl tells her that she still has him, and they hug. Daryl reminds her that New Mexico is still out there. She says that they might go there some day, but still have things to do here.



"
Home Sweet Home
"


Near the 
Hilltop
, Daryl and Carol are joined by 
Maggie
, along with two other members of her group, whom she introduces as 
Elijah
 and 
Cole
. Maggie explains that she and 
Hershel
 have been living with the group until the destruction of their village, so she thought she'd resettle everyone at Hilltop. Carol and Daryl give each other an uneasy look, much to Maggie's confusion. Things are cleared up once the pair show Maggie that Hilltop has been destroyed. While she is looking over the burnt out husk that was once her home, Carol tells Maggie that Negan was with the Whisperers the night that it burned down. Maggie realizes it was Carol who let him out, but the latter defends her actions, asserting that Alpha needed to die, and Negan was their best chance at making that happen, and that he is the reason they didn't lose everything. Cole asks if they're supposed to just live alongside Negan in 
Alexandria
 despite the fact that he burned down the Hilltop and killed Maggie's husband, to which Daryl replies that they're still figuring things out. Maggie thanks Carol for telling her, before storming off. As the others follow her, Daryl tells Carol that she didn't have to reveal anything, but Carol think she owed Maggie the truth. Daryl says that he will help Maggie retrieve the rest of her group in an attempt to smooth things over, but Carol doesn't believe Maggie will ever come around on Negan. When Daryl asks if Carol has, she simply shrugs and says it was nice to see Maggie again.

As Daryl trails behind Maggie, 
Kelly
 catches up and volunteers to help with the mission, as she also wants to look for 
Connie
. The group walks for most of the day, until Cole informs Maggie that there is only half an hour of daylight left. Maggie wants to keep going, but Cole convinces her to call it a day and find some shelter. Maggie decides to clear out walkers from nearby a parking lot, which Daryl and Kelly are uneasy about but go along with. Things go well at first, until Maggie notices a group of walkers coming out of a container and attempts to close the door, injuring herself in the process. Luckily, she manages to close the door with Daryl and Elijah's help. Later that night, as Maggie tends to her wound, Daryl comes to talk to her. He says that he is glad she is okay, as he got scared something might have happened to her when she stopped replying to the letters. He then asks about Maggie's life after she left. Maggie recounts how she and 
Georgie
 would help other communities, but it would fail. When Daryl inquires about Georgie's status, Maggie says that they found a community near Knoxville several years ago and helped them. 

While Maggie decided to stay with the group along with Hershel, Georgie and the 
twi
ns
 went searching for a city out west. Not long after, the community in Knoxville where Maggie stayed in fell, forcing her and other surviving members of the group to run. Maggie reveals she hasn't seen Georgie since. When Daryl asks what happened to her group, referring to her most recent home, Maggie declines discussing it for now, but says that it felt good to say some of it out loud. She adds that she also almost came home afterwards, but she and her group instead traveled to a place near the ocean that Maggie's grandmother owned, and where she and 
Glenn
 talked about going to one day. She asserts how much Hershel loved it there, and how one night they stayed up late and Maggie told him stories about his family. When Hershel asked how his father died, Maggie told him that a bad man killed him, to which Hershel wanted to know if the bad man got what he deserved. Maggie reveals that she left because she didn't want Negan to occupy her thoughts any more, and didn't want to bring Hershel back to that either. The next morning, she says, they met a whole other community, and joined forces. Daryl assures Maggie that she can come home, and that things aren't decided with Negan. He also wishes to defend Carol, but Maggie understands her actions. With that, Daryl takes his leave, and tells Maggie he will be next door if she needs him.

In the morning, the group wakes up and prepares to leave, when they're interrupted by a walker. As Elijah dispatches it, Cole wonders where Kelly is, since she's supposed to be on watch. Maggie finds and chastises Kelly for abandoning her post. Daryl explains that Kelly's sister is missing. Elijah quickly climbs up the truck tosses the jacket to Kelly, with Maggie revealing that Elijah also lost his sister. As they're traveling, Maggie asks Daryl if Connie is still alive, but Daryl doesn't know. Although he hopes she is, he isn't too confident, and thinks maybe it's for the best if Kelly doesn't know either. Maggie thinks the opposite, as her 
father
 used to say a wound can't heal until it hits air. Daryl jokes that isn't true medically speaking. Just as they're about to arrive to the rendezvous, they see a smoke cloud rising in the distance. Horrified, Maggie runs ahead, closely followed by the others.

Maggie desperately searches for Hershel in the burned-out building, but doesn't find anything apart form the corpses of two of her group members. Cole is sure that this is the work of the 
Reapers
, a group that attacked and destroyed their former home and apparently followed them to 
Virginia
. Maggie is determined to find the rest of the group and her son. Daryl finds some footprints, including Hershel's, and determines that the group fled north. He also assures Maggie they will find the group responsible. After a while, the trail splits, so the group decides to split up as well, with Daryl and Maggie heading in one direction and Elijah, Cole and Kelly in the other. Cole hears some noises, so instructs Elijah and Kelly to take cover. When they decide to move again, Elijah remains still. Upon noticing this, Kelly asks Elijah if he's okay, and requests that he remove his mask. He does so, and is visibly scared. She comforts him and tells him that he is not alone. Elsewhere, Daryl and Maggie are following their trail. As Daryl heads off in one direction, an unknown figure stalks him. Daryl grabs a young woman, 
Maya
, and briefly holds her hostage, but releases her and apologizes when Maggie identifies her as a member of her group. The trio are joined by 
Gus
 and 
Ainsley
, two other members of Maggie's group. Maya explains that the place they were staying in was set on fire, and that 
Jen
 and 
Billy
 didn't make it out, while 
Matty
 was killed by something in the woods. She didn't see who did it, but Gus is certain the Reapers are responsible. Maggie asks about Hershel, to which Ainsley says that he was found by 
Kim
, but she hasn't seen either one since. The conversation is cut short when Gus is abruptly shot in the throat with a silenced weapon.

The group runs for cover as the 
unknown assailant
 takes pot shots at them. As Daryl and Maggie sneak through the woods, they hear another shot and a woman groan. Ainsley has been shot in the stomach. Unfortunately Daryl and Maggie can't help her, as they both agree that it's a trap. Maya, however, takes the bait, and is promptly shot in the chest. Before she dies, Maya points to a direction, which Maggie takes as a sign that she saw Hershel. Continuing to take cover from the shots, Maggie and Daryl determine that there is only one shooter, and that he has to reload after three shots. Maggie decides to flank him, and instructs Daryl to keep his attention. As Maggie sneaks up on the sniper nest, she only finds the shooter's rifle. As she searches, a camouflaged figure lunges at her with a knife, but she dodges and stabs him in the chest. Despite this, the man shrugs off the injury, pushes her to the ground, and pulls the knife from his chest. He tries to kill Maggie by throwing the knife, but she ducks out of the way in time. As the man advances towards her, Maggie backs up into a trap and is strung up on a tree. 

Before the man can kill her, Daryl shoots him in the side with his crossbow, before charging the attacker. The man once again shrugs off the injury and effortlessly tosses Daryl into a tree, knocking him out. Fortunately, this buys Maggie enough time to free herself. Just as she is about to face the aggressor once more, the man is shot in the chest with an arrow, and quickly surrounded by Kelly, Elijah, Cole, and the remaining members of Maggie's group. Maggie furiously questions the man about his identity and his group, but he says nothing. Maggie threatens to kill him, as she knows he is alone, and inquires about his motive for attacking the group. The man calmly tosses his weapon to the ground and simply says "
Pope
 marked you", before pulling a pin from a grenade and blowing himself up as the others dive for cover. Afterwards, Maggie and Daryl search the woods for Hershel. Maggie whistles for him when something falls on her head. She looks up to find Hershel sitting in a tree.

Later that night, the group rests. Daryl comes in to talk to Maggie. He tells Maggie that it's been quiet. He also assures her that the Reaper knew he was a dead man and was just messing with her. Maggie says that she will come back with them to Alexandria, even if she has to deal with Negan. A few days later, the group arrives to Alexandria, only to find it under repair after being trashed in the Whisperer 
attack
.



"
Find Me
"


Daryl is preparing to go on a hunting trip. As 
Carol
 approaches, she notices a map that Daryl dropped and picks it up. With Daryl struggling to start his bike, she offers to do it for him, as she has experience with peddle sewing machines. Daryl declines her offer, but supposes Carol wants to come along, which she confirms. After he manages to start the bike, she climbs on it as well, despite Daryl's reluctance. The two playfully bicker as they ride away, with 
Dog
 running beside them. After stashing the bike in some shrubbery, the pair find a deer trail, but it turns out the deer has already been partially devoured when they find its corpse. They discuss where to hunt next. Daryl suggests the river, but asks if Carol is okay with that, which she affirms. After a lengthy trek, Carol gets a foot cramp. Daryl thinks might have been better off searching for food in another area, but Carol wants to spearfish before moving on. Despite Daryl's doubt of her abilities, Carol spears a fish on her first try. 

Later, as they're filleting Carol wonders if their luck has run out, with the recent losses of Hilltop and Alexandria. Daryl points out they didn't lose Alexandria, and is confident they can rebuild, but Carol is more pessimistic, as she believes rebuilding is futile and the dead will catch up to them eventually. Daryl says he isn't going to let that happen, before cutting off the conversation altogether. Suddenly, Dog takes off running after something, with Daryl and Carol rushing after it. Dog leads them to an old, abandoned 
cabin
, which Daryl clearly recognizes. He briefly remembers a 
woman
 playing with Dog on the porch. Carol suggests they stay the night, as Daryl reminisces further.

He remembers his life five years ago, when he was still searching for 
Rick
. Camping on a nearby riverbank, Daryl is surprised when Dog, then still a puppy, runs up to him. Daryl happily pets the pup, but it soon runs off. With that, Daryl goes back to his improvised shelter and studies a map he drew of the surrounding area, deciding on where to search for his friend next. Later, he reunites with Carol, who briefs him on current events, such as the increased isolation of the communities and Maggie leaving Hilltop. Carol impatiently asks how long Daryl plans on staying out in the wilderness, as it's already been two years. Daryl doesn't know, but supposes he will be searching for as long as it takes. Carol understands and says that she would help him if she didn't have obligations at the Kingdom with 
Henry
 and 
Ezekiel
, but Daryl assures her that he knows. Before he leaves, she tosses him some supplies. Further downriver, Daryl finds an overturned boat. Once he kills the nearby walkers, he checks the body underneath, but it isn't Rick. Back at his shelter, Daryl weathers a storm. Much to his anguish, the rain destroys his map. Defeated, Daryl walks out into the rain.

One year later, Daryl is still searching, when he stumbles upon some iron spikes protruding from a tree. Soon enough, Dog, now grown up, runs from out of the trees and beckons Daryl to follow him. The canine brings him to a nearby cabin. He busts inside an kills a walker, but is soon ambushed by a woman, who holds him at gunpoint. The woman asks for his name. Daryl attempts to leave, but the woman prevents him from doing so. Back in the present, Dog fixates on a spot on the floor. When Carol removes the floorboards, she finds a box with a note inside. Reading it, Carol realizes the cabin belonged to the woman from Daryl's past. She asks him about this, but Daryl is dismissive, letting Carol know that he already told her everything. Carol, however, doesn't believe him. Sighing, Daryl asks what else she wants to know, to which Carol replies that she will listen to whatever Daryl wants to tell her.

Four years ago, Daryl sits tied up inside the cabin, as the woman drags the walker corpse outside. Daryl fiddles with his ropes, but is stopped by the woman. Daryl asks if she's going to kill him. She asks if she should, and believes Daryl doesn't want to die. Daryl spits back that she doesn't know anything about him, which she acknowledges, so asks for his name again, and why he is trespassing on her land. Daryl introduces himself and says that he was just trying to help, but Leah snarks that he is tied up with a shotgun pointed at his head, and rhetorically asks what kind of help could he possibly offer her. After a tense moment of silence, the woman decides to cut Daryl loose. Before he leaves, Daryl asks if she's going to tell him her name, but she tells him "no".

Six months later, Daryl is sitting at his shelter when he is startled by Dog. He takes Dog back to the cabin, where the woman thanks him for bringing her pet back. Since the woman still refuses to introduce herself, Daryl asks for the dog's name, but the woman simply calls him "Dog". The woman takes note of Daryl's scar, and says that living out in the wild isn't for everyone. Daryl supposes the lifestyle will catch up to all of them, but the woman replies that this will happen only if they let it. With that, Daryl takes his leave, and the woman tells him to be careful.

Eight months after this, Daryl is gathering some wood when he is ambushed by a group of walkers. He takes out a couple, but starts to retreat when he notices there are too many. Suddenly, the woman arrives to assist him and signals Daryl to follow her. They hide together and wait for the walkers to pass by. Once the threat has subsided, Daryl sternly tells the woman to stay away from his camp. Offended, the woman introduces herself as Leah as she leaves.

Three months after their encounter, Daryl arrives to the cabin and tosses a fish to Leah's doorstep. Sometime after Daryl returns to camp, Leah tosses the fish back at him, and says that she can catch her own. Daryl says that he was trying to be nice, but Leah asserts that she doesn't need him to be nice and just wants to be left alone. Daryl bitterly promises he won't bother her again, and Leah replies that she won't visit him either anymore. Noticing that she is still lingering, Daryl says that understands why she lives out in the woods by herself. Leah guesses that Daryl has been alone for a long time, too, which he affirms. Leah asks if Daryl has frostnip, but he brushes it off. Nonetheless, she invites him to spend the night at her cabin to get warm. 

Later that night, Daryl is woken to the sound of broken glass. He finds Leah picking up a broken picture frame. Leah explains that today is the birthday of the boy from the picture. She recounts how she didn't have a good family growing up, so she had to find her own. She fond that with her squad, with whom she fought side-by-side. When the world ended, they swore they would stay together. The squad, she says, gave her hope, and she tried to give the same to her son, Matthew. She tearfully admits that Matthew wasn't her biological son, but she adopted him after her close fried died giving birth to him. Tearfully, Leah laments that it doesn't matter, as Matthew is gone. She walks over to a window and looks over Matthew's grave. She continues her story, recounting how she was with Matthew and Dog's mother (who was pregnant) when the dead surrounded them. Leah was separated from her squad, and ran to the cabin with Matthew. It was only then that she noticed Matthew was bitten. Matthew died the same day Dog was born, which was the last time she saw another living person until Daryl. Leah asks him who he lost, so Daryl tells her it was his brother, who was lost in an 
accident
 but his body was never found. Leah asks if Daryl still thinks his brother is still alive, but he doesn't know, though promises to never stop looking until he finds out.

In the following ten months, Daryl and Leah spend a lot of time together, and even become romantically involved. Over time, however, Leah becomes increasingly frustrated with Daryl periodically leaving to look for Rick. One day, when Daryl reveals that he will be gone for a few days, Leah reaches her breaking point and asks Daryl where he belongs, whether it's by the river looking for his dead brother, with the family he left, or with her. Daryl claims he doesn't know, but Leah thinks he does, and tells him to choose. Later, Carol finds Daryl at his shelter packing up. She asks if he is coming back, but he denies this, and reveals he is just moving. Carol gifts Daryl a knitted vest, and tells him in turn it might be a while before she comes see him again. Daryl tells her that she doesn't need his permission to move on with her life, although she denies asking in the first place. He then supposes she wants him to move one with his, but she claims she just wants Daryl to find peace, as she doesn't want to lose him because he doesn't know when to stop. Daryl assures her that she won't lose him, before leaving. When he comes back to the cabin, however, he finds it trashed and Leah missing, along with Matthew's picture. Dog, however, is still present, and soon joins Daryl. Daryl writes Leah a message saying "I belong with you. FIND ME.", and places it in a wooden box Leah kept under the floorboards, along with a few cans of food. He then leaves with Dog, telling his pet not to worry, as he is certain they will get Leah back.

In the present, Daryl laments that he should have been there to help Leah. Carol asks if he thinks Leah is still alive or someone took her, but Daryl doesn't know. Carol considers the possibility that Leah left on her own. Daryl denies this, and blames himself for walking away. Carol comforts Daryl that it's not his fault every time he loses someone, and that losing Leah isn't on him, nor is losing Rick or 
Connie
. Daryl resentfully agrees to Carol's last example, as he blames Carol for losing Connie instead, since she never knows when to stop. Carol says that she is sorry for Connie, but isn't sorry for going after the 
horde
 nor making Alpha pay for killing Henry, because she was right. Daryl begrudgingly asks if her being right is all that matters. Carol realizes Daryl isn't upset with her because of Leah or Connie, so invites him to say what he really means.  

Daryl tells her that she shouldn't have come. Carol claims she just wanted to help, but Daryl retorts that she wanted to run instead, so that's what she did. Carol seems confused by this assertion, but Daryl thinks she ran because she couldn't deal with the guilt, so she made it his problem. Carol snaps back that Daryl's only problem is thinking he has to save everybody, and that she doesn't need a savior or a martyr, but a friend. Daryl asserts that friends don't have the same conversation over and over again, and that he is sick of it. Carol says that, in that case, Daryl should have let her get back on the boat. He coldly agrees that he shouldn't have stopped her, and gives her permission to run if she wants to, as he won't stop her this time. He, however, maintains that he knows where he is supposed to be. Carol sadly states that she was right, as their luck has indeed run out. She heads inside the cabin, leaving Daryl standing alone on the porch.

Daryl and Carol walk back to 
Alexandria
 in silence. Daryl gives Carol his pocket knife to open her canteen and says he's going to keep looking for supplies. He starts to apologize for their argument at the 
cabin
 but Carol stops him. They split up and take different paths. Dog follows Carol. Daryl gets on his motorcycle. Daryl's motorcycle breaks down as he rides through the woods. He leaves the motorcycle to go look for spare parts.

Daryl looks for spare parts in an abandoned car, then checks a nearby truck. A walker sits in the front seat. Daryl goes under the truck to look for parts. The walker climbs into the back seat, tipping the truck backwards and pinning Daryl. Daryl bangs the underside of the front seat to attract the walker's attention. The walker climbs back into the front seat, tipping the truck forward. Daryl shimmies free.

Daryl returns to his motorcycle with the spare parts then remembers that he gave his pocket knife to Carol. He wheels his bike down the road. Daryl spots a group of walkers and studies them through binoculars, in search of a walker that might have a pocket knife. He gets out his crossbow and approaches the walkers. The walkers hear Daryl and come after him. Daryl makes his way to a walker dressed in military fatigues, then falls into a pit. The walker attacks him. He kills the walker and finds a pocket knife on its body.

"
Acheron: Part I
"


Daryl, Maggie, and a group of Alexandrians mobilize at a 
military base
. They open a hatch in the ground. Maggie leads a small group into a helicopter hangar. Daryl and 
Alden
 hoist the packs up. A pulley snaps. Daryl grabs the backpack before it can fall on top of the walkers, but he cuts himself on the arm, and a drop of his blood lands on a walker. The walker stirs, rousing all the other walkers in the room. Maggie's group starts slaying the walkers. Daryl and Alden hoist the crew up to safety one by one.

The group returns to 
Alexandria
. Daryl hugs 
Judith
 and 
R.J.
 
Hershel
 runs up to Maggie with 
Cole
, 
Duncan
, and 
Agatha
, members of Maggie's old community who have made their way to Alexandria in search of Maggie. Nearby, 
Gabriel
 breaks up a fight between people arguing over food rations. Gabriel presides over an emergency meeting and announces that Alexandria only has enough food to last a week. Maggie proposes they replenish their supplies by taking back her old community, 
Meridian
, which was seized from them by a 
group
 that slaughtered most of her people. Daryl and Gabriel volunteer to join her. 

Daryl joins Maggie's group through 
Washington, D.C.
, en route to Meridian. Caught in a thunderstorm, they decide to take shelter in a subway station. Maggie's team descends underground. Daryl suggests they travel via the subway tunnels. 
Negan
 vehemently disagrees, but Maggie orders him to tell them the quickest subway route to Meridian, since he's the most familiar with D.C. They jump onto the tracks.

The group walks down a 
subway tunnel
. They hear pipes groaning from the storm winds. Negan points to a watermark on the wall, indicating that the tunnels regularly flood. He suggests they turn around, but Daryl shoots down his idea. In the subway tunnel, Daryl and the group encounters a pile of dead bodies, each wrapped in plastic. Daryl removes the plastic from one body and kills the walker when it snaps at him. They observe the walker made no noise because its throat had been slashed. Maggie instructs the group to kill all the walkers so that they can proceed.

Maggie's group stabs each walker dead. A huge walker silently attacks 
Gage
. Negan kills the walker and refuses to go further, calling Maggie's plan a death march. Gage and 
Roy
 agree with Negan, but Daryl disagrees saying they are not spitting up. Maggie insists Negan needs to stay with them to guide them through D.C. Negan guesses that Maggie just brought him along to send him to his death and brings up Glenn, which leads to Daryl punching him in the face. Maggie admits that she constantly thinks about killing Negan, and warns him not to push her any further.

Daryl's group realizes that Gage and Roy secretly fled and took all of their supplies. A 
herd
 of walkers appears further down the tunnel. They start killing the walkers and look for an escape route. Daryl runs after 
Dog
 as the rest of the group climbs a ladder to safety.



"
Acheron: Part II
"


Having followed Dog, Daryl knocks a hole in the wall and squeezes through. Inside the tunnel, he finds the remnants of a survivor camp, as well as some graffiti depicting the Fall. Back at the subway, Daryl finds a bag with some food in it. Upon inspection, he discovers a note scribbled on a one-hundred-dollar-bill, left by a boy to his father. He also finds a picture of the boy, 
Tom
, and his sister, 
Jesse
. Dog discovers a walker in a sleeping bag, so Daryl puts it down. It is then that he notices a map of the subway on the wall above. Suddenly, a loud noise is heard followed by a scream. Chasing after it, Dog jumps into a pipe, forcing Daryl to crawl in after him.

While Daryl is crawling through the pipe, the rest of the group finally manage to pry the door open and move forward to the next car. Nearing the end of the pipe, Daryl becomes trapped when a couple of walkers lean against the grating and slam it shut. Meanwhile, another walker is crawling after him, but Daryl manages to kill it in time. He busts out of the pipe and kills the remaining two walkers. Inside the tunnel, he finds a trail of blood and hears Dog barking. It isn't long before he comes across an injured Roy stumbling down the tunnel. Roy meekly asks for help before collapsing. After dispatching the walkers that were following Roy, Daryl comes to his side. He asked Roy if he went outside, and the latter confirms, acknowledging that it was a bad idea. He also says that he lost Gage, as well as the ammo bag he was carrying. When Daryl tries to tend to his wounds, Roy stops him, and instead hands Daryl remaining weapons, his pistol and grenade. Roy's only request is that Daryl tell his kids he didn't die a coward.

In the tunnel, Daryl hears the gunshots and rushes to the survivors' aid. Despite the group's valiant defense, the horde slowly advances. Daryl sneaks up behind the walkers in the front car and begins to dispatch the walkers with Roy's pistol. Out of ammo, the survivors must resort to melee weapons. Luckily, Daryl reaches the blocked door in time and is able to open it. Once everyone's inside, he shoves a grenade into a walkers mouth and pushes it into the horde, before slamming the door shut and taking cover. In the ensuing explosion, the remaining walkers are killed.

After retrieving Roy, Daryl and the group finally makes it to the surface. Daryl looks over the note he found. Agatha asks if they'll be heading out, but Maggie says they'll take a detour first to 
Arbor Hills
, where there is a hidden supply depot set up by 
Georgie
. She asks Negan if he knows where that is, and he confirms, offering to lead the way. Upon arriving to their location, the group is alarmed by the sight of bodies strung up all along the road they're on. Suddenly, the group is showered with arrows and throwing knives, killing Roy, and severely injuring 
Cole
. As the group scrambles for cover, they see a group of 
Reapers
 advancing towards them.



"
Hunted
"


Daryl is seen dodging a knife thrown at him by a Reaper. As another Reaper escapes into the woods, Daryl and Dog chase after him. 



"
Rendition
"


Separated from the group, Daryl sneaks around an abandoned building. After distracting a Reaper with a thrown rock, he slithers away into the woods, but is soon attacked by another Reaper. Daryl struggles against the Reaper until Dog assists him by biting the attacker. Dog is quickly tossed aside, but is able to escape. Two more Reapers arrive to the scene. When one tries to attack Daryl, however, another prevents him from doing so. This gives Daryl enough time to escape after throwing a knife at the Reapers. In the morning, Daryl guts a walker to cover his smell, and then sets off to search for Dog. One of the Reapers from earlier is searching for Daryl, but discovers Dog instead. Daryl hears Dog barking in the distance and rushes towards the noise, but finds him sitting at the feet of the Reaper who was tracking him. Daryl orders the Reaper to release his pet, at which point the Reaper takes her mask off and reveals herself to be 
Leah
. She is surprised to see Daryl again, and asks if he is alone. When Daryl confirms he is, Leah says that she saw him on the road with the others. She asks Daryl about them, this time holding him at gunpoint. Daryl claims this was a group he met on the road, but insists he isn't one of them. He attempts to deescalate the situation by leaving, and calls Dog back to him. When Dog doesn't go to him, Leah jokes that she always thought Dog liked Daryl better. Daryl says that, whatever the Reapers' problem is with the group, he's not a part of it. He tries to leave again, but is soon flanked by the two Reapers from earlier.

Daryl is captured and taken to 
Meridian
 with a bag over his head. He is taken into a shack and left alone with Leah. Daryl lets Leah know he did, in fact, come back and looked everywhere for her, adding that he is sorry she ended up with the Reapers. Leah asserts that the Reapers are her family. They, Leah says, never stopped looking for her and, when they found her, she came home. Leah than asks if the people on the road were Daryl's family, but he claims his people were wiped out in a conflict with another group, and insists he is alone. Considering Daryl's claims, she decides to clean him, but then smothers him with a rag until he is unconscious. When he wakes up, Daryl is waterboarded by two Reapers under Leah's supervision. One of the Reapers, 
Carver
, interrogates Daryl about the others, but Daryl sticks to his story and claims he doesn't know. Eventually, Leah decides to stop the interrogation, despite Carver's protests. Leah implores Daryl to talk, as their leader won't be so nice when he interrogates him. Daryl clarifies that he merely traded with the group by transporting their supplies in exchange for food, and claims he knew the group for less than a week. Leah, however, doesn't believe him, and Daryl tells her to just kill him already, but he is taken back to his cell.

After a brief nap, Daryl wakes up to find 
Frost
 has also been captured, and is imprisoned in the cell next to him. Frost tries to converse with him, but Daryl shoots him down, pretending not to know or care about him or his friends. Picking up on the ruse, Frost likewise pretends to be hurt by Daryl's words, and tells him that they should have let him starve. Frost is then taken away to be interrogated. Sometime later, Leah visits Daryl and chastises him for being stubborn and lying. Daryl swears he has never lied to her, and that he is not about to start. Leah again asks him about the group, but Daryl maintains he doesn't know anything about them, and insists that he'd help her if he could. He asks to be released along with Dog, and promises that she'll never see him again. Leah asks if that's what he wants, but their conversation is interrupted by a pair of Reapers dragging a badly-beaten Frost to his cell.

Leah goes back to Daryl's cell and tells him that one of her brothers is dead. 
Michael Turner
, she professes, was like the little brother she never had, and this was the first time she lost someone close to her since she lost Daryl. Daryl interjects that she didn't lose him, as he did come back for her, but she was gone. Leah protests that Daryl is the one who left in the first place, to which he admits that he was scared of letting go. After sitting in silence for a moment, Leah asserts that it doesn't matter, as their relationship wouldn't have worked out anyway in a world like this. Daryl wonders if this is her opinion or her family's. Leah snaps that Daryl has no right to judge them based on the things he has done himself, and claims that this is, and always was, who she really is. Daryl, however, doesn't believe her. Leah says that she can help Daryl save himself, and maintains she still cares about him despite everything. This is why, she warns, he needs to tell her something, or she won't be able to control what Pope will do, as her commander is angry about Turner and wants someone to pay. Finally, Daryl admits that the group was led by a "woman," with her lieutenants being "a tall, skinny guy who never shuts up" and a "priest who carries a shotgun." He also warns Leah that the group outnumbers the Reapers, with at least three dozen fighters. Grateful for the information, Leah promises to get Daryl out of his cell. Before she leaves, Daryl asks when he gets to meet Pope, to which Leah assures him it will be soon.

Daryl is taken to the cabin he was tortured in earlier. The other Reapers taunt him until Leah arrives. When the others leave, Leah unties Daryl and says that Pope is on his way, and instructs Daryl to follow her lead. Hearing a thump on the other side of the door, Leah goes to open it, but finds it locked. She then notices liquid leaking from underneath the door, and jumps away just as it is set on fire. With the cabin in flames, Leah and Daryl scramble to find a way out. Leah is soon incapacitated by the smoke, leaving Daryl to find something to pry the windows open. Leah finds the waterboarding table, which Daryl then breaks and uses one of the legs to pry the bars off the windows. He helps Leah climb out, before evacuating himself. Outside, they find that Pope and the other Reapers watching them. Daryl is deemed "forged by fire, ordained by God" by Pope, who welcomes him into their ranks.

In a private meeting, 
Pope
 asks Daryl if he believes in God. When Daryl admits that he doesn't, Pope is disappointed. Confused, Daryl points out that he passed their test, but Pope reveals the test isn't over. When asked what more he wants from him, Pope simply tells Daryl he wants him to understand. Over a drink and a cigarette, Pope explains the backstory of his group. The Reapers started out as a military unit serving in Afghanistan, where they saw a great number of their comrades killed. Despite their sacrifice, the politicians didn't really care about them, and just used them as props. In those dark days, the soldiers didn't have much to hold onto but God and each other. After returning home, many Reapers found it difficult to reintegrate into society. Ultimately, Pope formed a mercenary group comprised of his old unit, and they served all over the world. During the Fall, Pope witnessed such carnage that his faith in God started to waver, just like Daryl's. When the military bombed the cities, the Reapers survived by holding up in a small church, as everything around them burned. Despite their perilous situation, none of the Reapers were even injured. It was then that Pope came to believe the Reapers were chosen by God to survive. He compares this situation to Daryl making it out of the fire unscathed, claiming that God chose Daryl tonight as well.

Pope brings Daryl to a bonfire where the Reapers are eating dinner, and orders Bossie to give Daryl some food. Pope then praises Bossie for carrying his fallen comrade for ten miles on his back, to which Bossie exclaims that he just did what any of them would have done. After inquiring about Bossie's wounds, Pope notes that the wounds are on his back. Despite Leah trying to calm him, Pope once again asks where Bossie was when Turner was being attacked. Petrified, Bossie claims he was there, facing the enemy. Acknowledging this, Pope tells Daryl that it's human nature to run when scared, and that it takes divine strength to risk everything for someone else. Pope commends Daryl got Leah out of the fire first, proclaiming that God baptized him in that fire. However, Pope warns Daryl that there is one rule he forgot to tell him: never turn your back on your brother. Pope then adds that God doesn't just use fire as His baptism, but also his wrath. With this, he throws Bossie into the bonfire and burns him to death for his perceived betrayal. Daryl is disturbed by this, forced to play along due to being outnumbered.



"
On the Inside
"


Daryl is seen as Carver tortures Frost about Maggie's whereabouts. Pope orders Daryl to take a turn interrogating him. Daryl puts Frost in a chokehold and orders him to give up his friends' location. Frost refuses. Daryl chops off Frost's finger and again demands to know the location of his friends. Frost finally reveals the 
location
 of the supply depot. Pope dispatches Leah to scout the location with a crew of Reapers.

Daryl, Leah, Carver, and a crew of Reapers approach the supply depot. Daryl quietly shakes a hanging telephone wire to warn Maggie of their arrival.  The Reapers burst into the supply depot and search the house. No one is there. Leah orders them to search the entire town. The Reapers search another house. Daryl notices a trap door under a rug and quietly slides the rug over the door. He offers to track Maggie's group outside. Carver suspects something and quarrels with Daryl. Leah tells them to stop arguing and sends Carver upstairs to sweep the rooms one more time and warns Daryl that "you either with us or you're not".

Daryl and Carver argue once again. Daryl criticizes the Reapers' plan of attack and slyly incorporates intel about the Reapers as he talks, knowing that Maggie's group is listening. Carver accuses Daryl of being disloyal. Daryl admits that the only reason he joined the Reapers is because he cares about Leah, but says he will follow Pope out of fear. Carver notices the trap door and opens it. The basement is empty.

After checking all the buildings, Daryl, Leah, and Carver arrive back at Meridian and tell Pope that they found nothing. They then see Frost's body tied to a pole, and Pope says that he got everything he needed out of Frost, before bringing Carver inside Meridian and laughing with him about something. Daryl worries if Frost told him that he's not actually loyal to them.



"
Promises Broken
"


Daryl walks around Meridian and sees 
Powell
 exit the food shed.  Daryl asks Powell if he needs any help. Powell declines, putting a lock on the door. Daryl then offers Powell a cigarette, who accepts and thanks him for the offer. As Daryl lights it for him, the two hear the other Reapers talking in the distance, and Powell surmises that 
Washington
 and 
Ancheta
 have returned from patrol. Daryl witness Pope screaming at his subordinates for failing to find Maggie and her group, until Leah puts herself between him and the others to take the blame. Pope angrily orders Leah and Daryl to go scout again. Daryl and Leah search the outskirts of Meridian. Daryl commends Leah for standing up for her crew. Leah defends Pope's behavior and says he is like a father to her.

Daryl begins asking Leah about the Reapers' history and why they're after Maggie's group; Leah says they took Meridian, justifying it since they needed a place to stay, and that they are only hunting Maggie so she doesn't try to take revenge. Leah confides in Daryl that she sees Pope as a father figure and that his recent behavior is unusual, but Daryl is privately unconvinced. 

The two come across a lone survivor, who promises that he's alone and is looking for supplies for his sick wife. Leah asks Pope what to do with him over the radio, and Pope orders them to kill him and his family. The survivor leads Leah and Daryl to his hideout, where his sick wife and son are. Unable to bring herself to follow Pope's orders, Leah tells the man to leave with his son and never return, and he obliges as Daryl kills his wife out of mercy. Leah tells Daryl she will tell Pope he killed the family to improve his standing. Daryl tries to tell Leah something, but they are ordered to immediately return to Meridian.



"
For Blood
"


Daryl, Leah and Pope watch the horde from the top of 
Meridian
's perimeter wall. Leah observes the 
horde
 is moving in a peculiar pattern. Daryl offers to lead the horde away from Meridian. Pope adopts Daryl's strategy, but sends 
Wells
 instead. Pope asks Daryl for intel about Maggie. Daryl says that Maggie is a good shot and advises Pope to look for her in the trees. 

The horde continues to trip the mines outside Meridian. Leah laments all the people they've lost, but Pope reasons that every war has its sacrifices. Daryl looks through binoculars and sees Maggie's group wearing skin masks. Daryl joins Powell at his post and offers him a cigarette. He intentionally drops the matches and stabs Powell when he reaches down to pick them up. He shows Maggie and Gabriel where to sneak inside. Daryl breaks the lock on the door of the food shed. Daryl rejoins Pope and Leah. Leah tells him the walkers are scattering, but Daryl points out that they're actually advancing. 

Daryl, Leah, and 
Ancheta
 gather on a rooftop. Ancheta reveals the hwacha, a multiple rocket launcher that he designed. Daryl quietly asks Leah if she still believes in Pope. Leah admits it's hard to watch Pope hurt the people she cares about. He invites her to abandon the Reapers and run away together, but she refuses. Daryl reveals that the enemies they're fighting are in fact his friends. He begs Leah not to kill them. Leah reels as she processes his revelation. Pope joins them on the roof.

Pope orders Ancheta to launch the hwacha. Leah says the hwacha will end up killing their own people, but Pope reasons that it's their time to die. Ancheta lights the fuse. Daryl unsheathes his knives to attack Pope. Leah stabs Pope in the neck. Daryl hurls a knife into Ancheta and puts out the fuse. Leah finishes off Pope. Daryl reaches out his hand to escape with Leah, but she instead radios everyone that Daryl killed Pope and is with the enemy. She tells Daryl that she would do anything to protect her family. Daryl flees and joins Maggie and Negan in fighting the Reapers and walkers in the battle at the gates, only for the Reapers to pull back. Leah, having taken command of the Reapers, then orders the hwacha to be fired upon the group and their horde.

No Other Way

Daryl's group escapes the hwacha as they hide inside the compound. Daryl attacks 
Austin
, preventing him from shooting Gabriel and they get into a fight. Daryl manages to stab him, then strangles him to death. He hides just as Leah enters the room and discovers her Austin's body. He quietly escapes the room. After Maggie subdues 
Carver
 and is about to kill him, Daryl intervenes and insists they use Carver as leverage, despite Elijah's vow to avenge his 
sister
. Daryl radios Leah and proposes they talk.

Daryl, Maggie, Negan, and Elijah meet with Leah and the remaining 
Rea
pers
. Daryl offers to release Carver if the Reapers leave Meridian, but vows to kill them if they return. Leah rejects his offer and reveals that a 
sniper
 will gun them down if they don't release Carver. Daryl reluctantly lets Carver go. Gabriel shoots Carver in the leg and informs Leah via walkie that he killed her sniper. Leah accepts Daryl's terms and starts to leave with two Reapers. After Elijah tells her their people need to be avenged, Maggie shoots them in the back and kills the remaining Reapers, much to Daryl's chagrin, as he scolds her for that.

Daryl tracks down Leah and states that things could've been different and tells her to go before he changes his mind about letting her live. After finishing off the remaining Reapers, Daryl is seen by a campfire, where he talks with Gabriel about believing in God. Maggie then joins them afterwards. She reports that Alden is dead, and that Negan left. Daryl’s group distributes supplies at Alexandria and reunites with everyone. 

Daryl embraces Connie. A caravan of Commonwealth troopers approaches Alexandria's gate. Residents ready their weapons in defense. 
Eugene
 jumps out and tells Alexandria residents that the troopers have come to help. Daryl is seen listening to 
Lance Hornsby
 address the residents of Alexandria, and offer the 
Commonwealth
's help in rebuilding Alexandria, and 
"another, potentially more interesting choice"
 for any who are interested in it. 

Flash forward to five months later. Maggie and Elijah stand on the guard post at Hilltop. Commonwealth soldiers wait outside the gates and demand that Maggie open up. Maggie says it doesn’t have to be this way. A soldier removes his helmet: it’s Daryl. “Yeah, it does,” he says.

New Haunts
"


Daryl, 
Judith
, and 
R.J.
 creep down a dark hallway lined with caged 
walkers
. A walker comes at them but backs off after Daryl sends it away. It's just an 
actor
, and they are in a Haunted Maze. Daryl, Judith, and R.J. exit the Haunted Maze and mingle at the 
Commonwealth
's Halloween carnival. It is Day 30 of their new life in the Commonwealth.

Daryl remarks to Carol that it will take him a while to adjust to life in the Commonwealth. Everyone claps as Governor 
Pamela Milton
 joins the carnival. Daryl and Carol chat with 
Kelly
 and 
Connie
, who is working as a reporter for the Commonwealth newspaper. Daryl and Rosita leave their apartments to attend a Commonwealth training for 
troopers
, as they both signed up to join the Commonwealth Army.

Mercer
 leads a training exercise with new trainees explains that they must work in teams of two to clear a walker-laden obstacle course. Despite Daryl's insistence that he and Rosita are a good team, Michael pairs him with fellow trainee 
Daniels
 and Rosita with fellow trainee 
Green
. Whereas Rosita and her teammate are able to make it through the training course quickly and effectively while working together, Daryl prioritizes finishing the course swiftly over working in tandem with his partner, which results in Daniels nearly being bitten. As Daryl is about to come to his aid, Mercer intervenes and shoots the walker attacking Daniels, saving his life. Daryl annoyedly protests that he was about to do so himself, to which Mercer reminds him that the point of the exercise was to move fast and work as a unit. He asks Daryl to follow him for a special assignment.

Daryl, Mercer and Rosita head into the woods for a training session with 
Sebastian
. Mercer releases a group of walkers for Sebastian to kill. Sebastian struggles with a walker, prompting Daryl to kill it with his crossbow. Sebastian angrily tells Daryl that he could have handled it. Pamela passes by and looks at Sebastian with disappointment. Mercer advises Daryl that it's sometimes important to set each other up to win.

At home, Judith and R.J. ask Daryl if they can live permanently at the Commonwealth, as long as their 
mom
 knows where to find them. Later, Daryl arrives at the formal Halloween cocktail party back in the walls of the Commonwealth. There, Sebastian arrives as a guest of honor. As Daryl and Rosita watch him silently from behind the velvet ropes leading into the event, Sebastian stops and sardonically fixes Daryl's collar, giving him what Rosita describes as a "hate smile."

As the festivities progress, the party is interrupted when 
Tyler Davis
 begins accosting Pamela's leadership, declaring that the Commonwealth elites do not actually care for the welfare of its citizens. Daryl watches in silence as Tyler supports this claim by telling the room he tried endlessly to talk with Pamela one on one, only to be routinely ignored, and that he lost his job as a trooper and place of residence after making one "mistake": being overpowered and beaten by a 
prisoner
. After Tyler manages to escape the party, Daryl gives chase and corners Tyler inside the Haunted Maze and convinces him not to commit suicide. Sebastian follows them inside. Daryl instructs Sebastian to bring Tyler to Pamela, allowing him to take credit.

Daryl gets ready for work. He gives Judith a record player to play her new record. Daryl, Rosita, and a team of Commonwealth troopers storm Tyler Davis' apartment in search of rebels. Rosita finds a secret room in the back of a closet filled with propaganda for the resistance.

Alves
 and 
Castle
 pull Rosita and Daryl away from their assignment to investigate a herd of walkers on the north perimeter.

Alves and Castle take Daryl and Rosita to the northern perimeter. Sebastian joins them and orders Daryl and Rosita to retrieve a stash of cash hidden in a

Daryl warns Sebastien not to threaten the kids again, or he will cut him down.

Daryl and Rosita begrudgingly agree to help. They both enter the house and find the panic room where the cash is stashed. A woman named 
April
 pounds on the door from inside the locked room. She explains that she's the only survivor from a group of people who were sent in earlier to find the cash. She says a man had offered to help her out of debt if she could get the cash. Daryl turns on the generator in the garage to power up the panic room's keypad. He fights off walkers. Rosita punches in the key code and enters the panic room. An alarm blares, drawing walkers to the room. Rosita destroys the alarm while Daryl opens the safe and stuffs the cash in a bag. They barricade the door from walkers.

Mercer
 and Carol rescue them. Carol says she got Mercer after Daryl didn't show up for their lunch date. Rosita and April explain that Sebastian sent them to the house to get cash for him. Daryl's group quietly slips past walkers in the house, covered in walker guts to disguise their smell. April accidentally draws attention to herself and gets devoured. The group slays the walkers.

Daryl's group meets up with Alves and Castle and learns that Sebastian has already sent 30 or 40 people to look for the cash. Mercer shoots Alves and Castle dead, then instructs Rosita and Daryl to give the cash to Sebastian or else he'll come after them, as they can't win a fight against him. Daryl and Rosita deliver the cash to Sebastian at the trooper station. Sebastian gives a small cut of the cash to them and leaves, with Daryl giving a disapproving look.

Daryl and a team of Commonwealth 
troopers
 investigate 
Carlson
's corpse and the bloody aftermath at the 
apartment complex
. Lance interrogates 
Aaron
 and 
Gabriel

"
Acts of God
"


Daryl, along with Gabriel and Aaron, join a squad of troopers with investigating and clearing a house infested with walkers in search of the Riverbenders and Hilltoppers. Aaron points out that the troopers are not splitting up, while Daryl assures him they will eventually. Gabriel says the best plan of action is to work through the sweeps and make their way back to the Commonwealth. Aaron points out that the only way out of the situation is to fight their way out, but Daryl is certain that they will find an opening and slip from the group. When 
Romano
 orders they return to work, Daryl, in an attempt to redirect the group, suggests they check out Charleston in West Virginia due to rumors of illegal Commonwealth weapons trading occurring there. After fighting off a final group of walkers, Hornsby radios Romano about their position. As Romano reports "
second location is cleared, one more to go
", Daryl eyes him with uncertainty. Gabriel concludes Hornsby is checking in on where the three of them are, specifically, and that they need to be careful. Daryl agrees.

Later, at an empty junkyard, the troopers begin to encircle Daryl, Gabriel, and Aaron after receiving the order from Hornsby to kill them. Daryl shoots at the soldiers and a battle ensues, with Gabriel and Aaron both being shot non-fatally. Daryl manages to sneak up on Romano and knock him down. The three manage to take out the rest of the soldiers as walkers approach. Romano, who had his face bashed by Daryl, attempts to crawl away. However, Daryl grabs him from behind and interrogates him on Hornsby's location. He initially refuses, however he's horrified when he sees walkers approach and is given the choice between a quick death or a cruel death being devoured. Romano gives in and tells Daryl he's about 10 miles out, before Daryl shoots him in the head. Hornsby tries to radio Romano, but Daryl answers instead and tells him he isn't here anymore.

That night, Daryl, Gabriel, and Aaron are walking through the woods towards Hornsby's location, when they notice some traps. Gabriel finds an object that belongs to Leah and Daryl realizes she is back. The next day, during her fight with Leah, Maggie is saved by Daryl when he shoots her attacker through the back of the head. Daryl remains relatively unemotional having to kill his former lover, and looks out the window and sees that Hornsby's group have found them. He aims at Hornsby and shoots at him, grazing his cheek, prompting the soldiers to fire. Daryl and Maggie flee the scene.

Daryl and Maggie reunite with Aaron and Gabriel as they walk through the woods, looking around for any danger.



"
Lockdown
"


Inside an abandoned building, Daryl and Maggie dispatch walkers while in hiding from Lance and his troopers. Gabriel and Aaron meet up with them, with Negan and Annie in tow. When at a crossroads of deciding whether to fight Lance or get back to the Commonwealth, Daryl realizes they can do both: Negan hasn't been seen or targeted by the community's leaders yet, and will therefore be able to and get to Carol and the others without being arrested. 

Later on, after Negan manages to kill two troopers and and before he takes their vehicle, he leaves one of their guns and a walkie-talkie by a van, which Daryl emerges from to grab the supplies. When Hornsby and his men arrive at the scene of the troopers' deaths, Daryl engages in a firefight with them from behind the van he hid in, where he kills several of them and wounds Lance in the arm. 

The walkie-talkie left behind by Negan crackles to life with a message: the car Negan stole has been spotted, and is being pursued down a nearby street. As Lance and his remaining soldiers attempt to kill Daryl, the latter manages to slip by them and steal their car, speeding off towards Negan's position. As a car of troopers try and take Negan out as both parties speedily navigate roads littered with abandoned vehicles and walkers, Daryl arrives and broadsides the troopers' car, immobilizing and knocking them out/killing them while allowing Negan to continue towards his target destination.

Meanwhile, Daryl and Maggie are roaming the streets, evading the Commonwealth soldiers. They take hiding on lower ground as soldiers pass by. Maggie then apologizes to Daryl for what he had to do to Leah. Daryl answers that Glenn would want him to look after Maggie and that she never has to say sorry. Gabriel, Aaron, and Annie meet up with them. Daryl asks what they saw and Gabriel answers that Lance is dug in with half his men and they wouldn't be able to get close, prompting Annie to suggest they take a covert approach through a nearby sewer vent.

Daryl, Gabriel, Aaron, Maggie, and Annie climb down into the sewers and make their way through the tunnels, killing any walkers in the way. Daryl suggests they get Lance and his soldiers to go to them. Everyone covers their ears as Gabriel shoots up the sewer to get Hornsby's attention.

Down in the sewers, two soldiers make their way through and are about to put down a walker when suddenly the group ambushes them. However, it's a distraction and Lance and more soldiers emerge and surround the group. However, Daryl appears from behind and grabs Lance while holding a knife to his throat. More and more soldiers emerge as Daryl orders everyone to lower their guns. Through it all, Lance merely lets out a psychotic grin.



"
A New Deal
"


Daryl holds Lance hostage as the group is surrounded by Commonwealth 
soldiers
. Suddenly, 
Mercer
 yells for everyone to put their weapons down, as he, 
Pamela
, 
Carol
, and 
Negan
 arrive at the scene. Daryl pins Lance to a wall with his knife at his throat. Pamela orders him to lower the weapon since she needs Hornsby alive, but he refuses. Mercer also tells Daryl to lower the knife and that he's on Daryl's side. Carol steps forward and Daryl questions what she had done, she says she made a deal for them which gets them all out of the situation unharmed, but they need Lance alive for it to work. Daryl finally obliges and lets Lance go. However, he suddenly slam Lance's hand down and stabs it hard with his knife. Lance screams in pain before Daryl removes the knife, stating that he'll live before dropping his knife and walking away.

Daryl stands outside as Carol explains the deal. Pamela will provide all the supplies they need to rebuild on their own and let them go free. Whether they want to go back to their old communities or stay at the Commonwealth is up to them. In return, Pamela will have Lance framed for Sebastian's crimes. Annie says they'll have more time to talk about the situation with their people, but Negan points out that the Commonwealth killed most of their people. Maggie says the most important thing is everyone is together and doesn't want to go it alone anymore. Although she doesn't trust the Commonwealth, if the deal gets them back home she is all for it. Daryl also agrees as he grabs an apple.

The group starts to pack their things to head to their community. Daryl asks if Lydia is okay before saying he never got to thank her for saving Carol. Lydia answers that she never thanked Daryl for saving herself. They hug and say their farewells. Aaron hugs goodbye to 
Gracie
 and says he'll be back soon. Daryl takes out 
Rick
's gun and hands it to Judith, but she states she doesn't want it and hands it back. Daryl is confused but takes it back. Judith then brings up when her 
mom
 said she'd hang her sword up for good and feel like she didn't need it anymore and believes if she keeps the gun, things will go back to the way they were. Daryl says that things will get better once they get back home, but Judith continues to go on, saying that it's still broken and that there are still people who need help at the Commonwealth. He says it’s not their job to keep helping people. She then says it's the same thing as what him, Rick, and Michonne did with Hilltop, the only difference being he's running away then stay and fight. Daryl gets frustrated and tells her to stop. Daryl watches as Judith walks away and Aaron and his group leave to Oceanside.

At their apartment, Daryl is finishing packing up. He puts on his signature vest and walks to the living room where 
R.J.
 is reading a comic book. Daryl asks R.J. where Judith is and he says he's not supposed to say. Daryl sees that her bag isn't packed. He asks where she went, but R.J. doesn't budge and pretends to not know. Daryl goes out to look for her. He meets up with Carol who says they'll find her. He comments that he's not a very good parent and asks what Rick would do. Carol says when 
Sophia
 was born, she had no idea what she was doing except that she loved her. Carol reassures Daryl he'll figure it all out eventually.

Daryl finds Judith in the church and goes to talk with her. She tells him she wasn't trying to worry him. Daryl understands that she just wanted to be alone and that he also had a spot where he went to be by himself, a river behind his house where he would stay and wait until his abusive father went to sleep. She says that sometimes being alone is good, with Daryl adding it gives you time to think. Daryl apologizes for scolding Judith earlier and says he doesn't know what he's doing but is trying is best, wishing things were the way she wanted to be. He says he'll hold on to the gun for a while and asks if they're good. Judith says they are, before the two get up to go say goodbye to their friends.

Daryl, Carol, and Judith arrive as the Founders Day activities go on. Judith sees her friend 
Mei
 and Daryl beckons her to go have fun. Eugene is in charge of playing the recording and Max goes over to give him the recording of Sebastian. Eugene asks if she is alright and tells him she'll be fine. Just then, an announcer says that the main event, a wrestling match, is about to begin. Mercer arrives, alone with Pamela and Sebastian who take front seats to watch the wrestling match. The announcer riles the crowd up and the fight begins. A staged fight between 
Captain Commonwealth
 versus 
Attila
 and 
Lothar
 happens, with the crowd cheering for Captain and booing Attila and Lothar. Captain wins the fight and chants 
"Commonwealth! Commonwealth!"
 prompting everyone to join in.

Daryl watches as Sebastian prepares to deliver a recorded speech to the people but Max and Eugene play Max's recording of Sebastian's cynical and entitled view of the Commonwealth and its people and his disgust for the poor. The crowd turns on the Miltons and begin throwing things and trying to get onto the stage. The Commonwealth soldiers hold soldiers back, even having to resort to physical violence. The angry crowd continues to be difficult. As Max is running away, she then sees the previously killed cleaning crew members now reanimated, causing panic amongst the citizens as they flee the scene. The walkers kill many civilians along the way.

More civilians get killed by the walkers as Daryl and Judith try to escape. However, Daryl loses Judith in the crowd and calls out for her. Judith watches in horror as she sees one walker eating a body before approaching her. However, Daryl shoots him with Rick's revolver. Judith asks for the gun, saying the civilians need their help. Daryl complies, drawing his knives, and tells her they work together. Mercer walks through the crowd and kills the walkers, with Daryl and Judith doing the same. Sebastian attempts to murder Max by pushing her on top of one of the walkers but Eugene saves her by throwing the walker on Sebastian, who is severely bitten. The walker is put down by Judith, but Sebastian dies of his wounds. Judith watches sadly next to Daryl as Sebastian's speech continues to play in the background on a loop.



"
Variant
"


In the immediate aftermath of Sebastian's death during the Founders Day celebration, Daryl guilds Eugene away from the oncoming soldiers. Eugene insists that he needs to find Max, but Daryl, determined to save his friend from the situation he's gotten himself into, pulls him into a nearby store to hide. Daryl is sharpening his knife at the 
church
 when someone knocks. He readies himself in case it's an intruder, but it's just Rosita. She asks if he's talked to the others and he answers that they'll all be leaving at dawn. Eugene emerges from the back and Rosita asks how he's doing. He answers that he's better than he deserves and asks if they have seen Max, which she answers they haven't. 

Eugene apologizes for putting the group in danger for his actions, but Daryl tells him not to be since Sebastian had it coming. Rosita says they need to get Eugene out of there and Daryl says he knows when the guards change shifts so they can slip out while they switch. Eugene looks conflicted and Rosita asks what's up. Eugene answers that he needs to go after Max, but Daryl says they can't since all the guards are looking for him. Eugene refuses to leave without Max. Rosita says she will go find her and try to get them both out. Just as she's about to leave, an announcement from Pamela is heard that anyone who has information about the whereabouts of Eugene or his accomplices will be rewarded.

Eugene looks out the window to see trooper activity to help Rosita find Max. Daryl asks if he's trying to get himself caught, but Eugene is tired of sitting around. Eugene attempts to leave, but Daryl stands in his way. Eugene tries to act tough and challenges Daryl to a fist fight. Daryl does nothing and seems amused by this. Daryl tells Eugene he can go ahead, but when he tries to leave Eugene questions why he isn't stopping him. Daryl knows that Eugene isn't going to go and he realizes he is right and sits back down. Eugene calls himself a coward but Daryl just says he's smart. Eugene then calls himself a liability and knows he always has been and the only reason he's alive is because of his deceitfulness. Daryl asks if people are born brave or they become it. Daryl answers both, before patting him on the back and going out to watch for more guards. Daryl and Rosita return to the church. Rosita informs Eugene that Max has been taken into custody, and Daryl points out the troopers' shift rotation is about to occur, meaning they need to leave soon. Eugene says that he is not leaving. Daryl leaves to go check on the others before their departure.



"
What's Been Lost
"


Arriving at 
the Coalition
's wagon after escaping from an ambush, 
Carol
 finds it abandoned with supplies strewn around and a trail of blood. Hearing the sounds of a fight from a nearby building, Carol moves to investigate. Inside, Daryl is being strangled by an attacker who has already been stabbed by him in the shoulder, while a third man lies dead nearby, having been killed by Daryl in the fight. As the man shrugs off all of Daryl's desperate attacks, his partner begins to reanimate and Carol hits him over the head from behind, saving Daryl's life. Grabbing his remaining knife, Daryl prepares to fight the man again, before his zombified partner rises up and bites the man in the neck from behind. Taking advantage of the distraction, Daryl stabs both men in the head, killing them, and retrieves his other knife. Recovering, Daryl tells Carol that they took the kids, but Carol corrects him that everyone has been taken.

Daryl tells Carol that he was jumped and that the attackers even took 
Dog
. Daryl thinks that the attackers were working for Pamela and they need to find 
Mercer
 for help. However, Carol worries that Mercer would possibly turn them in, meaning that he can't be trusted. 
"Shit. There is one other person,"
 realizes Carol and Daryl guesses that she's talking about 
Lance Hornsby
. Carol points out that Lance knows all of the dark shit that's going on in the Commonwealth, so he'd probably know about this. While Carol knows where to find Lance, this isn't going to be easy.

In the 
Commonwealth Jail
, Daryl and Carol subdue two guards and take their 
guns
 and keys. Carol locates Lance's cell where they find the traumatized and blood-covered Lance muttering in the corner about how 
"there's always a path. Always a way out,"
 while staring at his lucky coin, a zombified 
Sebastian
 laying amongst 
Roman Calhoun
's dismembered remains. Although shocked by this scene, Daryl draws one of his knives and stabs Sebastian in the head, putting him down. Choking Lance up against the wall, Daryl demands to know where their friends have been taken and presses on Lance's 
facial wound
. Seeing Lance's state, Carol stops Daryl and tells Lance that they can't leave him there alive, so his options are telling them where their friends are or dying.

Finally focusing on Carol, Lance agrees to show them, stating that he gets that they don't trust him, but Lance knows a way out of the city and the two agree. However, Daryl spots an ankle monitor on Lance and he explains that it'll set off an alarm if Lance leaves. Daryl goes to cut it off, but Lance tells him that he'll have to cut off his foot and carry him. Instead, Carol tells Lance to be ready to run, but he stops them to do something first. Alarms ring through the jail as the three make a run for an exit. 
Commonwealth soldiers
 shoot at Daryl, Carol and Lance and Daryl returns fire, ordering Carol to leave with Lance while he covers them. Daryl promises Carol that he will figure it out and he continues to exchange fire with the soldiers as Carol and Lance escape. It's later revealed that Lance had bashed open Sebastian's head and left his lucky coin behind in Sebastian's spilled brains as a final message to 
Pamela
.

At night, Carol and Lance flee from a tunnel filled with a 
herd
 of walkers, only to encounter a Commonwealth patrol outside. The lead trooper issues orders that they will tell command that they had found the pair, but they put up a fight, so the soldiers had to put them down. However, Daryl drops down from where he was hiding under the patrol's jeep and shoots the soldiers from behind with Carol rushing in to finish off one that was only just wounded with her knife to the head. Watching this, Lance just shakes his head at Carol in amazement.

On a hill overlooking a 
train depot
, Daryl reports on the two guards walking the perimeter in shifts and Lance figures that it shouldn't be a problem to take them out for Daryl and Carol and they will then head for their friends. While the tracks fork a few times along the way, Lance knows the route that the supply train takes to get there. Daryl and Carol are surprised to learn that the Commonwealth has a working train and Lance explains that it was part of a plan to expand the Commonwealth's reach, connecting communities across the continent to the sea, although Carol figures that the Commonwealth's intentions were to conquer the communities, not connect them. Daryl reveals to Lance that they intend to leave him behind as they no longer need Lance's help. Daryl and Carol can now simply wait for the train to come and then see where it goes. Lance insists that they still need his help, reminding Carol that they had talked about this: not burning the Commonwealth down and building a better future for the children and everyone else. While Carol admits that she did hear Lance, it was only because he didn't leave her with another choice with his refusal to shut up. Lance expands upon his ideas for how they can work together to build the Commonwealth into a better place, but Daryl and Carol are uninterested in Lance's manipulations.

Daryl and Carol offer Lance the chance to leave and go into exile which Daryl points out is more than Lance deserves after everything that he's done. Lance acknowledges that he's made mistakes, but Lance insists that that's not who he is anymore and that the guy who did those terrible things died back in his cell while this Lance won't survive out here, but Daryl doesn't care after everything that Lance has put them through while Carol suggests that Lance is smart enough to possibly survive. Daryl and Carol refuse to hear anything more and Lance moves as if to leave. However, Lance suddenly grabs a rifle from the back of their stolen jeep and takes aim at Daryl and Carol, prompting Carol to shoot Lance in the neck with an arrow, mortally wounding him. With barely a glance at their fallen enemy, Daryl and Carol drive off, leaving Lance to choke to death on his own blood.



"
Outpost 22
"


On a hillside, Daryl and 
Carol
 observe several Commonwealth soldiers at a siding by the 
Commonwealth Train Depot
 that 
Lance Hornsby
 had led them to. The train arrives, carrying two Commonwealth jeeps and motorcycles and Carol asks if they can follow it without being seen. Daryl thinks that if they hang back far enough, they'll be fine before a jeep arrives carrying a captive 
Connie
. Seeing one of the soldiers talk into a radio, Carol turns on their own stolen radio and they overhear the soldier report that he has to put an exile on the train despite it being a cargo transport and thus against regulations. Another man responds that it has been cleared from on high as Connie is going to be Designation 2 rather than a worker. The soldier is ordered to get her there safely, but the reaction of both men to the news makes it clear that Connie being Designation 2 isn't a good thing. Carol wonders what Designation 2 is while Daryl knows that they can't go get Connie as the soldiers will radio ahead and warn everybody. They need to find the kids first, but Daryl is clearly troubled by his inability to help Connie. Carol reassures her friend that they will follow the train to the others and bust them out all at once. Daryl watches the train leave with a conflicted look on his face.

Daryl and Carol follow the train in their stolen jeep, but they have trouble keeping up with its course. Carol has Daryl race ahead of it and they stop at 
a junction
 that the train is eventually going to hit where Carol suggests that they just sit tight until it does. However, Daryl doesn't think that he can do that and gets back in the jeep. Carol stops him from leaving, knowing that seeing Connie being taken aboard the train reminded them both of 
losing Connie
 in 
Alpha's Cave
. Carol reminds Daryl that Kelly had told them that 
"we can't save them if we're dead"
 when they thought that they had lost Connie. Carol is willing to follow Daryl's lead on this, but she worries that if they go it alone, they might just be making the same mistakes again. Daryl reluctantly concedes that Carol is right, and she takes his hand in comfort.

A short time later, Daryl and Carol come upon an escaped 
Maggie
 cradling the dead body of a 
child walker
 with a wounded and unconscious 
Nelson
 nearby.

At Junction 7, Daryl lowers Nelson to the ground against a wall and checks his wound. Recognizing that it's mortal, Daryl tells Nelson that he's running out of time, and he asks the other man to do something good with the time that he has left and tell him where the train is going and what Designation 2 means as one of Daryl's friends was put on it with that designation. Coughing up blood and in pain, Nelson doesn't respond to Daryl's questions. Daryl tells Nelson that he was like him once: he joined the force because his family needed money which Daryl guesses is Nelson's motivation as well. Turning violent when Nelson continues to remain silent, Daryl yells that the Commonwealth has taken his kids from him and he wants them back, going so far as to kick the dying man. Entering, Carol tells Daryl that the train is going to be here soon, and Daryl suggests that they can hurry, drawing his knife and he offers Nelson the choice of dying quick or screaming.

Gabriel
 recognizes Nelson as a man from 
his church
 who was there every Sunday at the back pew closest to the door. Nelson would always come a little late and leave a little early, and it had seemed like Nelson had wanted to talk about something. Nelson asks if God forgives people like him, but Gabriel doesn't know, although he wishes that he did. Nelson admits that he's torn up all of the time with guilt and shame. Gabriel states that it's because Nelson's a coward, but that's alright as he's trying not to be. Gabriel knows that fear can drive people to do things that bring shame, but it can also push them into the light. Nelson is trying to do the right thing now which God sees and so does everyone else. Nelson tearfully wishes that he'd talked to Gabriel sooner which Gabriel wishes too. Nelson coughs up blood and Daryl nods to Gabriel who tells Nelson that 
"people remember the last thing that you do. The end of each story is very important. How do you want yours to end?"
 Nelson finally reveals that the Commonwealth punishes exiles by making them do hard labor and their friends are on railway duty. However, Nelson doesn't know where as he was only called out when they escaped, and they have to follow the train to find their friends. Addressing Daryl, Nelson states that he's only heard rumors about Designation 2 with the rumors stating that the Designation 2s are taken far away and they are never seen again. Daryl leaves and Gabriel agrees to pray with Nelson while he goes. Carol leaves at Gabriel's request and he sits down and prays with the dying man.

A few minutes later, Gabriel emerges carrying a bloody knife, having stabbed Nelson in the head to keep him from reanimating after he died. Daryl tells his friends that Connie's gone if the train pulls in, but Rosita worries that if the train sees them coming, they're going to radio ahead and the best way for them to get the kids is for the Commonwealth to not know they're coming. Daryl refuses to just leave Connie on the train and Carol tells him that she has an idea about how to do both.

The train arrives at the junction where 
Trooper 192
 emerges and puts down a walker before trying to move the junction switch which is stuck. 
Wilson
 attempts to let Outpost 22 know that they have a stuck junction switch and that it will take a few minutes to dislodge it, but he receives no response as Trooper 192 puts down another walker that emerges from the woods. Entering the cab, Maggie orders Wilson to put down the radio at gunpoint. Daryl and Carol sneak along the side of the train, putting down an approaching walker before ducking as an annoyed 
Jones
 asks his fellow soldier how hard it can be and Trooper 192 challenges him to come over so he can show Jones. Spotting a 
herd
 emerging from the woods and coming down the tracks, Jones orders 
Trooper 301
 and 
Trooper 263
 to cover the woods and the flank respectively.

Daryl and Carol crawl under the train as Jones jumps off the side, puts down a walker and goes to join Trooper 192 at the junction switch. In the woods, Trooper 301 finishes clearing the woods of walkers and calls in that the woods are cleared and she's heading back. Rosita and Gabriel ambush the soldier, disarming and killing her quietly so as not to draw notice from the other soldiers. Jones attempts to move the junction switch without success, and takes a closer look, realizing that someone had purposefully jammed it.

Alarmed, Jones orders everyone to get back there now, but Daryl opens fire before anyone can respond, killing Trooper 263. As Daryl and Carol take cover on the train, Jones and Trooper 192 each come down one side of the train, engaging in a gunfight with Daryl and Carol. Maggie emerges from the train cab and shoots Trooper 192 dead from behind. Daryl proceeds down the side, only to have Jones emerge with Connie as a hostage. Jones forces Daryl to disarm himself and, after Daryl admits that they had disabled the train's long-range antenna, Jones demands to know exactly what they did to it. While the soldier is distracted by Daryl, Connie breaks free and Jones takes off running through the train, chased by Daryl after he makes sure that Connie's alright. Jones takes one of the motorcycles being transported on the train and flees while Carol helps Connie to her feet. Leaving his friends to deal with the approaching herd, Daryl takes the other motorcycle and chases after Jones who crashes his motorcycle after going off-road with it in an attempt to avoid Daryl. Sliding his motorcycle under a fallen tree, Daryl hits Jones, sending him to the ground and knocking the man's helmet off. Daryl stabs Jones in the head, killing him.

Carol, Maggie, Gabriel and Rosita lead Wilson into the building where he refuses to help, stating that he's dead if he helps them. Wilson is shocked to see Nelson's dead body and Maggie warns the man that he's dead if he doesn't help them. Wilson explains that his family lives at a nearby outpost and if 
the Warden
 finds out that he helped them, Wilson will end up just like their friends. Rosita explains that the Commonwealth took their children and asks about the family that Wilson had mentioned before suggesting that Nelson had a family too. After a moment, Wilson tells them that there's a map in the train's engine room. Maggie and Carol take Wilson to get the map. Daryl returns and reunites with Connie, admitting in sign language that he was afraid that he wasn't going to see her again. Connie reassures Daryl that she's not going anywhere, causing Daryl to chuckle.

Suddenly, Daryl and Connie hear the sound of Wilson shouting at Maggie and Carol and rush over to see him holding a tool to his own throat while the two women try to talk him down. Wilson is terrified that the Warden will kill his wife and two sons if he helps them. Carol offers that if Wilson helps them, they will injure him, nothing serious, just enough to make it look like the engineer had barely gotten away from them and Wilson can tell the Warden that he escaped. However, Wilson believes that the Warden will know that he lied, torture him once he does and then kill Wilson's family. Despite Carol's efforts to talk him down, Wilson drives the tool through his neck, 
killing himself
 in order to spare his family from the Warden's vengeance.

Connie asks Daryl if they don't know which way to go which he confirms. Connie knows that Kelly is at Outpost 22 and scared and Connie can't lose her. Daryl promises Connie that they will find Kelly and Rosita suggests getting the train's long-range radio working again. Agreeing with the plan, the group heads back to the train to get the radio working again.

At night, posing as Trooper 301, Rosita radios in to Outpost 22, claiming that the train was overtaken and she's lost in the woods with the group still looking for her and she needs to get back to the site. Finally, a 
friendly soldier
 responds and Rosita identifies her location as Junction 7, stating that she's the last one left. The woman begins giving Rosita direction from Junction 7 to Outpost 22. The soldier informs Rosita that they don't have any spare units to send out her way for a pickup as they have a convoy coming in for colonial processing on Pamela's orders. 
"Word is that most of the processees used to live here before the Commonwealth claimed the territory and turned it into an outpost, back when it was still called 
Alexandria
."
 The soldier tells Rosita that the Warden will debrief her when she arrives and to shoot to kill if she has to engage any hostiles. The group is stunned by the revelation that Outpost 22 is actually Alexandria and Daryl informs Connie of this development. 
"Milton has underestimated us since day one. We are gonna get our kids, take back our home, and make it right. And Pamela is never gonna see it coming,"
 Maggie declares to her friends who are filled with new determination.



"
Faith
"


At the railroad tracks just outside of 
Alexandria
, the 
Commonwealth
 prisoners work under the supervision of 
the Warden
 and his 
soldiers
. 
Negan
 and 
Kelly
 observe the patterns of their captors with Kelly communicating her observations to 
Magna
 in sign language. Working with 
Ezekiel
, 
Princess
 recognizes the missing 
Tyler Davis
 amongst the other prisoners from their brief 
imprisonment
 in the 
rail yard
 before he 
later
 took 
Max
 hostage and then 
mysteriously vanished
. While Princess doesn't like Tyler, she knows that he's ballsy and that might be useful to them.

As Negan gets a drink, Magna discreetly reports what Kelly had told him about the locations of the soldiers which Negan sketches out. Ezekiel approaches Negan and asks for the map, but Negan spots 
Annie
 nearby and, ignoring Ezekiel, approaches 
Roberts
 and offers to pick up a couple of extra shifts so that his wife can have her workload loosened. Negan appeals to Roberts personally who appears to consider it before they are interrupted by 
Sanborn
. After being told that Negan is mouthing off, Sanborn decides that they need to show him his place and hits Negan with the butt of his 
rifle
. Negan attacks Sanborn, but he is knocked to the ground by Roberts and kicked in the gut. Seeing her husband's predicament, Annie rushes in to intervene and shoved to the ground by Sanborn and is dragged away with him after a brief scuffle as Roberts keeps Negan from intervening at gunpoint. Hidden in the bushes nearby, a worried Daryl and 
Carol
 observe these proceedings.

Outside of Alexandria, Daryl reports that the situation is really bad and he's not sure that any of their friends are going to make it. 
Gabriel
 asks if they saw everyone and Carol clarifies that they only saw the adults and that there was no sign of 
Coco
, 
Hershel
 and the other kids. Both 
Maggie
 and 
Rosita
 are concerned by this with Rosita wanting to go in immediately. Daryl, acting as 
Connie
's sign language interpreter so that she understands their conversation, tells the others that they can't go in as there are too many guards and they'll never make it. Gabriel is furious that Pamela had turned their home into a prison after promising to give it back, but Maggie realizes that Pamela had never actually intended to give it back. Daryl comes up with the idea of going in through the 
sewers
 and Connie volunteers to go with him while Carol knows a way back into their old house, but she needs some backup just in case the guards blocked it. Maggie decides to go with Carol and Daryl orders them to head for the windmill where a sewer grate is. Rosita wants to go with them too, refusing to stay outside while Coco is inside, but Carol reminds Rosita that she and Gabriel are their best sharpshooters if it comes to that. Carol promises to keep in touch in case something goes wrong, and Rosita reluctantly agrees, although she will come in if takes more than a night. Daryl hands Gabriel his gun and the group separates to enact their plan.

Daryl and Connie enter the sewers and Carol informs them over the radio that they made it and are good which Daryl confirms is the same for him and Connie. Daryl passes on the news to Connie who looks for reassurance that this will work. Moving through the sewers, Daryl puts down a couple of trapped walkers and both he and Connie admit that they're scared.

At night, as Ezekiel and Negan's 
rebellion
 succeeds in overthrowing 
the Warden
, the Warden attempts to escape by using Kelly as a hostage. However, Daryl and Connie come up from behind the Warden and Daryl stabs the Warden in the back, incapacitating him and retaking Alexandria from the Commonwealth. Negan prepares to kill the Warden with a rock, but he's stopped by Rosita. Rosita demands to know where her daughter is, but the Warden refuses to answer. Seeing Sanborn reanimate, Rosita grabs him and holds the walker over the Warden's face, once again demanding to know where her daughter is. With a smile, the Warden sadistically tells Rosita that she will lose everything, and Rosita furiously shoves the zombified Sanborn into the Warden's face which Sanborn begins devouring, killing the Warden. Rosita walks away, leaving Sanborn to eat the Warden as her friends, the soldiers and former prisoners watch in shock and horror at the brutal death.



"
Family
"


In a reclaimed 
Alexandria
, 
the Coalition
 recover their various weapons from a large crate full of weapons confiscated by 
the Commonwealth
.

In front of the windmill, 
Rosita
 passes the corpses of 
Sanborn
 and 
the Warden
, grabbing an extra clip for her gun off of Sanborn's belt. 
Gabriel
 asks 
Tyler Davis
 if there's anything that he knows that can help them find the missing children and Tyler reveals that, when he was a soldier, kids without parents would end up at the 
Commonwealth Children's Home
. However, Tyler doesn't know where it is, so he goes to get the location from the captured 
Commonwealth soldiers
 at Gabriel's request. Rosita impatiently calls for the Coalition soldiers and freed prisoners to board the Commonwealth's transport bus. 
Princess
 asks 
Magna
 if anyone actually knows how to drive a train, but Magna reassures her that one of the prisoners apparently used to be an engineer before they board the bus, with 
Kelly
, 
Connie
, 
Adrienne
 and 
Dianne
 amongst those joining them.

As 
Maggie
 loads the back of the bus, 
Negan
 asks how she plans to take out 
Pamela Milton
. Negan gets that others have their own reasons for going back to the Commonwealth, but as far as he's concerned, none of them are safe as long as Pamela's still alive which he guesses that Maggie agrees with. Negan suggests that they can take out Pamela together without the help of the others, but Maggie closes the bus door and walks away, telling Negan that 
"we're not a we."
 In front of the bus, Maggie hugs 
Hershel
 and says a tearful goodbye to her son. 
Annie
 hugs Negan from behind and orders her husband to be careful. Negan states that he always is, and Annie tells Negan to come back in one piece while she holds down the fort in Alexandria and Negan promises to do so.

Nearby, 
Ezekiel
 says goodbye to 
Nabila
, 
Aliyah
 and 
Gracie
 while Daryl promises R.J. that they will be back soon and orders him to look after Judith. However, Judith tells Daryl and 
Carol
 that she's coming too over Daryl's objections. Judith reminds her friends that this isn't the future that Carl wanted and it's not what Rick and Michonne fought for, not yet at least. What they're doing could help everyone, maybe everybody everywhere, not just them. Judith wants to be a part of making what her family believed in real. Carol recognizes that while everyone else has been focused on the present for a long time, Judith has been thinking about the future which is a good thing and something that they could all do a little more of. Daryl agrees on the condition that Judith stays right with him, and he leaves R.J. in Nabila's care while they're gone.

On the railroad tracks, the Commonwealth's train smashes a walker to bits. Inside, observed by Daryl, Carol, Maggie and Judith, Rosita pours over a map of the Commonwealth with Gabriel, telling him that once they get inside, they will move the former prisoners into hiding and, as they hopefully get Mercer on their side to take out Pamela, she and Gabriel will go to get 
Coco
 back. Gabriel notices that they're going in through the lower ward and wonders why they're not going in through 
the Estates
 instead. Rosita points out that with more money, the Estates have more patrols, meaning that they don't stand out as much in the lower wards. They're going to use an access road that will allow them to hit the children's home from behind. Gabriel smiles at Rosita and promises her that they will get Coco back which is his faith in Rosita talking and Rosita is glad that Gabriel is with her.

A concerned Judith tells Daryl and Carol that she hasn't heard from Michonne in a long time. While Judith had tried to reach her mother a few times, she was unsuccessful. Carol reassures Judith that there could be a lot of reasons for that and Michonne can take care of herself better than just about anyone that Carol knows. Daryl promises Judith that both Rick and Michonne would be very proud of their daughter. Judith asks if Carl would be proud of her too and Daryl nods while Carol tells Judith that she and Carl are a lot alike. Judith remembers that her brother had died saving people and she wishes that she'd had more time with Carl and that they have more time to just remember everyone that they've lost along the way. Carol promises that they will, and Daryl promises that, when this is over, he will tell Judith every story that he remembers about all of the people that loved her before pulling Judith into a hug.

Outside of the tunnel entrance, four Commonwealth soldiers patrol while the Coalition forces hide nearby. Negan tells the others that they are sitting ducks and Mercer isn't coming and they can't wait for him. Carol agrees that it's time for a new plan, but Princess is sure that Mercer is gonna show up. Daryl states that they're running out of time and Carol decides to head around and try to find another way to slip in. Maggie suggests that they could take the four guards, but Rosita warns her that if those guards go missing, the clock is going to start ticking on them. Judith draws the others attention as one of the guards notices something and starts heading their way. However, Lieutenant Rose calls in with orders from Mercer for the guards to report to the East Gate immediately to deal with the incoming herd. Lieutenant Rose confirms that that includes Tunnel H and he reassures the soldiers that the tunnel is locked, and they've got it covered on the other end. Complying with his orders, the guards move out. Breaking the lock on the door, the group makes their way into the tunnel.

The Coalition forces emerge from the tunnel in the seemingly-abandoned Union Station. Daryl quickly deduces that something isn't right, and he notices that the outer doors are all chained shut. Realizing that it's a trap, Daryl yells for everyone to get down as Pamela's private forces, situated on the station's balcony, open fire, killing Tyler and two former prisoners standing near him as everyone else dives for cover.

A gunfight erupts between Pamela's forces and the Coalition with Rosita desperately trying to get the doors open. One Alexandria resident crawls towards a hiding Connie, Kelly, Magna and Dianne, but he is shot in the head and killed by one of Pamela's men before he can reach them. As the gunfight continues, Pamela herself emerges and grabs a 
gun
 from one of her men who is killed by the Coalition. Pamela takes aim at Maggie, but Judith notices and shoves Maggie out of the way just in time, saving her life. Instead, Pamela accidentally shoots Judith, seriously wounding the young girl. Daryl desperately attends to Judith as Pamela watches in horror and the others increase their fire, killing a few more of Pamela's men. Yelling that 
"you did this,"
 Pamela retreats to her office. Looking for a way out, Daryl spots a 
fire extinguisher
 near Ezekiel and signals him to throw it. Grabbing Rick's Colt Python from Judith, Daryl shoots the fire extinguisher, creating a smokescreen.

In Union Square, 
Yumiko
 and 
Max
 observe the heavily guarded doors to Union Station from across the street. Hearing twigs snapping, Yumiko spots a hooded 
Eugene
 sneaking around a train car, armed with 
Brooks
' rifle and she tells Max that they are going to go around. Inside, under cover of the smokescreen, Daryl and the others manage to break the chains sealing a side door. As a trooper approaches the doors, Eugene ambushes him and knocks the man out with the butt of his rifle. Magna finally breaks through the doors, and everyone is reunited with Eugene, Yumiko and Max before quickly making their escape.

The Coalition races through the streets towards the 
hospital
 with Daryl carrying the unconscious Judith. Commonwealth vehicles drive up and block their path in multiple directions, forcing them to fall back. Carol realizes that the soldiers aren't following them as they begin to erect barricades in the streets. Loudly yelling and firing their guns in the air, Commonwealth soldiers lead the herd in their direction before closing the barricades, penning the herd and the Coalition in. Spotting a walker climbing over something, a shocked Negan asks 
"what the fuck?"
 As walkers close in from multiple directions, 
Luke
 and 
Jules
 emerge from the herd, causing Kelly to nearly shoot them before Connie stops her sister. Fleeing down a side street, Carol spots an alley near part of the herd and everyone attacks the walkers, clearing a path for Daryl to flee down the alley towards the hospital with Judith. Waking up for a moment, Judith calls out 
"daddy?"
 and witnesses her friends and loved ones struggling to hold back the herd before passing out again.



"
Rest in Peace
"


Carrying the badly injured and half-conscious 
Judith
, Daryl bursts into the 
Commonwealth Hospital
, desperately yelling for help. Daryl lays Judith down on a stretcher and continues looking for help as the dazed Judith witnesses two 
Commonwealth soldiers
 rushing by carrying a box of medicine. Encountering Daryl, the two men knock him unconscious and leave. Judith spots the 
herd
 approaching the hospital and stumbles to her feet and begins closing the still-open doors. Struggling against a walker, Judith manages to brace the doors shut with a desk before passing out on the floor next to Daryl.

Later, a bandaged and bruised Daryl regains consciousness in a bed with 
Carol
 at his side and 
Magna's group
 nearby desperately trying to save 
Luke
's life, having 
amputated
 his bitten leg. Getting to his feet against Carol's objections, Daryl checks on a pale and unconscious 
Judith
 who is lying on a nearby stretcher, noting with concern that Judith has lost a lot of blood. Looking at their friends' desperate attempts to save the dying Luke, Carol informs Daryl that all of the doctors, nurses and medicine are gone, taken by 
Pamela Milton
 to where she's holed up in 
the Estates
, leaving the rest of 
the Commonwealth
 to fend for itself. Daryl decides that they need to get to the Estates, but Carol informs him that there's too many soldiers and they're hoping to find somebody who can get them in without a fight. Daryl suggests that 
Mercer
 can help as he knows people on the inside and Carol tells him that Max thinks so too and that there's a team after him while some of the others are looking for the missing kids with everyone planning to meet back at the hospital. Daryl hates the idea of just waiting, but Carol corrects him that they're going to take care of Daryl and Judith while the others are gone.

Near death from the bite and blood loss, Luke has his friends remove a harmonica that he's kept from his pocket and Yumiko promises him that they'll keep the music alive for him. With his last words, Luke asks everyone to promise him, and they all do so. Luke dies in his friends' arms as they all sob at losing him. Taking a knife from Kelly, 
Magna
 stabs Luke in the head to prevent him from reanimating and the group sobs over his corpse. Watching the others' grief, a determined Daryl decides to give Judith a blood transfusion, explaining that he's a universal donor and that 
Merle
 had used to make him sell his blood when he was a kid as a way of making money. Carol helps Daryl set up the transfusion as they watch the others cover Luke's body in a sheet. Hearing loud noise and shouting, Carol and the others leave to sweep the hospital for walkers and to make sure that the others are okay while Daryl remains with Judith.

A confused Judith wakes up and panics that she's going to die when Daryl informs her that Judith's at the hospital. Daryl tries to reassure Judith, but she feels like she's going to die, worrying that 
"
Mom
's gonna find Dad and we're gonna be together. We're all gonna be together,"
 but at the moment it feels like she's going to die instead. Although visibly shocked by the implication that 
Rick
's still alive, Daryl reassures Judith that she's going to be fine. Judith starts to quote something that Michonne had used to say to Rick, but she passes out again as banging and screaming sounds in the background. Reentering the room, Carol tells Daryl that walkers have breached the hospital and they have to go. As Daryl tries to wake Judith up, Rosita calls in with the news that her group is in the alley behind the hospital, but they wrecked their ambulance going through the herd which is now surrounded by walkers.

Daryl begins wheeling Judith's stretcher out, but stops after seeing walkers pounding on the glass at the front doors of the hospital. Disconnecting the blood transfusion, Daryl barricades Judith in the room and rushes to help in the lobby where walkers drag 
Adrienne
 outside and devour her while the group barricades the doors again. Looking at the numerous walkers outside of the windows, Carol and Daryl shocked to see a variant walker breaking the glass with a brick while Connie spots more walkers coming down the hallway from the other direction. The variant breaks through the glass and is immediately stabbed in the head by Carol, but more walkers break in from the other side and drag a man outside and devour him. With walkers converging from the three sides, the group attempts to fight them off, only to have more walkers break through the barricaded door as well. Racing down a clear hallway, the group grabs Judith's stretcher while Magna radios the others to warn them that the hospital has been breached and they're leaving out the back. The group races through the hospital towards an exit as walkers close in on them from multiple directions.

At night, outside of a loading dock, Mercer observes a crowd of desperate Commonwealth residents demanding to be let into the Estates. Mercer reassures Maggie that they will be able to move soon while Aaron tells Ezekiel that he saw people on the higher floors and rooftops begging for help, but he wanted to make sure that Lydia was safe first. Ezekiel reassures his friend that he did the right thing. Hearing screams in the distance, both men are determined to do more, but they need to take care of Judith first. Lieutenant 
Rose
 arrives in another truck and reports to Mercer that they're all set: everyone is in the back and there's no one to check. The doctors have set up a safe house, but they have to hurry. Mercer calls for everyone to go, stating that they need to get Judith to 
Tomi
. Everyone boards the truck with Princess, Max and Dianne pushing Judith's stretcher.

At the safe house in the Estates, Daryl lays Judith on a bed and Tomi immediately begins tending to her. Tomi informs Daryl that Judith is in a fragile state, but he did a good thing by giving her blood. Tomi promises to do what he can and enlists Ezekiel's help. Ezekiel orders the others to clear the room, promising to get them when Judith is stable. In another room, Aaron wraps up Lydia's stump and offers her some advice based on his own experience with losing an arm. Having learned of Luke and Jules' deaths, Lydia is upset and believes that the still-missing Elijah and Jerry are dead too. 
"That's just what happens. You know, people die. Cities fall. And things just don't work out. People tell me they do, but they don't."
 However, Aaron refuses to give up hope that their friends are still alive somewhere and he promises that they will find them both. A concerned Maggie enters, looking for Negan, but nobody has seen him in awhile.

Her injured arm now in a sling, Judith wakes up as Daryl and Carol watch over her, much to their relief. Judith admits that she doesn't feel great, but she's fine like Daryl had promised her. Daryl asks if what Judith had said about Rick and Michonne was true, and Judith reveals that it's why Michonne had never returned. Daryl and Carol are stunned by this, and Judith apologizes for not telling them earlier, having been afraid that Daryl would leave too if he knew that Rick is still alive somewhere. Daryl reassures Judith that he's still there, before they are interrupted by shouts outside and two gunshots. Looking outside, Mercer sees a man trying to climb the wall, only to be shot by Commonwealth soldiers on Pamela's orders. Mercer tells the others that the soldiers are shooting anyone that climbs the gates and grabs a gun, unwilling to just stand by as people are dying. Mercer informs the Coalition members that the truck is gassed up with enough reserves in the rear to get them home. Mercer and his men can sneak them out the back as Mercer believes that this isn't their fight or their people. 
"Yes, they are. And so are you,"
 states Ezekiel. Addressing the others, Ezekiel tells them that 
"you may not think this place is worth saving, and I get that, given how they treated us. But it's worth it to me. The people are worth it, and I'm not gonna allow them to fall without a fight. Not today. I'm with you. Who else?"
 Aaron immediately agrees, stating that they can do more than just save themselves and they need to. Following Ezekiel's lead, everyone agrees to fight to save the Commonwealth.

At the gates of the Estates, the crowd desperately begs Pamela to be let in, amongst them 
Mr. Martens
, 
Mrs. Martens
 and 
Mei
. On a balcony, Maggie lines up her shot on Pamela, but Negan tells her to hold on as Mercer and his loyalist forces move in, ordering Colonel 
Vickers
 and her men to lower their weapons. Pamela orders Vickers to arrest them, but the Coalition forces join Mercer's troops from another angle, creating a standoff. Pamela accuses Mercer of being a traitor, but Mercer states that she's the true traitor and lists Pamela's crimes: disappearing hundreds of citizens, leading the dead to their doorstep, shooting a child and now leaving thousands to die.

The banging on the gates grows more frantic as the herd begins to approach the Estates, meaning that the people will die if they're not let inside. Gabriel moves towards the gates despite Vickers orders to stop. Gabriel announces that they're opening the gate and letting everyone inside, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him. Vickers threatens to shoot him, but Carol warns her that they will fire back if she does. Pamela orders her men to shoot Gabriel as he reaches the gates and one of them points a gun at his head. Suddenly, Daryl yells for them to stop. 
"What the hell you doing?"
 Daryl demands. 
"We all deserve better than this. You built this place to be like the old world. That was the fuckin' problem."
 Pamela states that if she opens the gates, the dead will get in too, not just the living. Daryl tells her that if she doesn't, Pamela will lose everything anyway. 
"We got one enemy. We ain't the walking dead."


Realizing that Daryl is right, Vickers orders everyone to lower their weapons and give Gabriel the key to the gates. Everyone stands down and Vickers defers to Mercer's command who places Pamela under arrest for high crimes against the people of the Commonwealth. As everyone rushes to help let the people in, Maggie informs Negan that Pamela is getting arrested and Negan tells her that prison is a fate worse than death for someone like Pamela, causing Maggie to relent in shooting her.

The crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in 
Alexandria
 and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified 
Lance Hornsby
, Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of 
suicide
. Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rife, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back.

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates.

Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

Sitting in a jail cell, Pamela tells Daryl and Carol that it's not easy to have so many lives in your hands. You will have to make ugly decisions such as picking who will do the jobs that no one wants and who gets the nicer house. Carol tells Pamela that they've already had to make an ugly decision by keeping Pamela alive even after everything that she's done because they've all done things. Carol promises Pamela that they will figure it out and Carol will make sure of it. Pausing on her way out, Carol quips that 
"at least we don't have to worry about who gets your house."
 Daryl and Carol leave and Mercer locks the cell, leaving Pamela facing a lifetime in prison for her crimes.

In Alexandria, everyone enjoys a celebration and feast, joined by Mercer, Max and Tomi. Judith gives 
Dog
 some of her food and Yumiko raises a toast to Luke. Looking out the window, Daryl sees Negan walking away and the two men exchange a smile and a nod, parting on good terms. Yumiko turns to Magna, telling her 
"same"
 and Magna kisses her, the two women resuming their romantic relationship. Sitting down, Rosita smiles as she watches the celebration before becoming somber. Noticing Rosita's somber mood, Gabriel joins her, and Rosita tells him that she just wants to remember this perfect moment. In a whisper, Rosita reveals her bite and impending death to Gabriel. Noticing Rosita's behavior and crying, Judith realizes that something's wrong with her and becomes upset, apparently deducing the truth.

Weak and near death, Rosita is led to bed by Maggie and Carol where Coco is laying. With everyone now aware that Rosita's dying, a tearful Maggie gives her a hug and kiss goodbye and Carol hugs her before the two women leave. As Daryl watches from the doorway, a barely composed Gabriel performs Last Rites over Rosita. Rosita kisses Coco for a final time and Gabriel promises that they will see her again someday. Gabriel carries Coco out as Eugene takes a seat next to Rosita's bed. Eugene tearfully tells Rosita that he wouldn't be the man that he is today if he hadn't met her. Taking Eugene's hand, Rosita tells him that she's glad that it was him in the end who will be there to make sure that she won't reanimate after she's gone. Rosita peacefully passes away with her oldest living friend at her side and Eugene breaks down completely.

A year later, Daryl attends Ezekiel's speech after he becomes the new governor of the Commonwealth with Mercer as his deputy governor. Spotting Daryl, Connie rushes over and hugs her friend. Connie asks Daryl how the frontier is and Daryl, now completely fluent in sign language, responds that it's quiet for now and asks how work is. Connie tells him that it's great and she's keeping the new administration honest which Daryl agrees has to be her. Daryl notices that Connie seems to be happy, and she confirms that she is, causing Daryl to laugh with pleasure.

Daryl and Carol, who is now wearing her hair short again as she did before Rick's disappearance, look at the old memorial wall of the people that the community had lost. Alexandria has been fully rebuilt and is thriving again with the residents enjoying everyday life together. Aaron, Gabriel, Coco, and 
Gracie
 greet Lydia, Elijah, Judith and 
RJ
 and Lydia gives Gabriel a package from Father 
Grant
 and his 
old congregation
. Daryl and Carol join them while Jerry and 
Nabila
, walking through town as their daughters play outside, smile at them. Aaron admits that he never thought that they'd get back to any of this, although he had hope. Aaron calls them all very lucky, but Gabriel corrects Aaron that it's effort rather than luck. They have a lot to be proud of in their family, community, and future.

The group from the Commonwealth next visits a rebuilt and thriving 
Hilltop
 where Maggie and Hershel watch as Adam plays. Carol asks Maggie what she had wanted to talk about, and Maggie reveals that she wants to talk about the future. 
"There's a lot out there to find out about. And I think it's time we did."


Sitting on a bench next to a river in the Commonwealth, Carol calls it a beautiful day to head out. Daryl wishes that Carol was coming with him which Carol agrees with, but she feels that this is going to be good for both of them. Daryl tells Carol that he's proud of her, she has taken Lance's job, made it her own and made everything better for her and the kids and Carol will keep making everything better. Carol becomes emotional, telling Daryl that he will too, and Daryl reminds Carol that it's not like they won't ever see each other again. Crying, Carol tells Daryl that she's allowed to be a little sad and that he's her best friend and Daryl holds her.

At the side of the road, Judith, RJ and Ezekiel join Daryl and Carol as he prepares to depart on his motorcycle. Daryl hugs the kids and RJ promises him that he will be good while Judith promises to keep an eye on Dog for him. Daryl asks Judith to keep an eye on Carol and promises her that if he sees or hears anything about Rick and Michonne while he's out there, he will find them both and bring them home. Calling him Uncle Daryl, Judith states that Daryl deserves a happy ending too and Daryl promises to come back. Daryl hugs Ezekiel goodbye and he leads the kids to the top of the wall to watch Daryl's departure. Daryl and Carol hug and admit that they love each other before Daryl drives off on his motorcycle through the Commonwealth gate, setting off through the countryside on his new journey.

"
L'âme Perdue
"


An unconscious and injured Daryl floats tied to an overturned rowboat as it moves towards land. Daryl recalls 
Judith
 
telling him
 that Daryl deserves happiness too. Daryl rolls off of the rowboat near land and crawls on shore, collapsing on the beach as his boat is washed away by the waves. After drinking from an abandoned bucket, Daryl limps his way inland and spots a road sign which is in French.

In the nearby village, which lies in ruins, Daryl finds an abandoned motorboat with some empty 
alcohol
 bottles, water, medical supplies, a large blanket and a tape recorder. Looking at a picture of the family who owned the boat, Daryl listens to the 
boat owner
's logs and his desperate attempts to find a safe place for his family during the early days of the 
Trials
, spending 19 months at sea and finding 
Spain
 to be no good. The man decides to try 
Marseille
 next, hoping that the south of 
France
 will be good. Looking at a map marking out the man's route, Daryl realizes that he's in France. As night falls, Daryl cooks a fish that he caught and continues to listen as the man talks about losing his wife 
Sue
 to a 
heart attack
 and having to keep her from reanimating. The man sadly notes that their 10th anniversary would've been in June and their daughter 
Holly
 won't stop crying because she wants her mother back, to go home and for things to be the way that they were again. Sadly, holding Holly's stuffed penguin, Daryl looks at his reflection in a cracked mirror nearby.

The next morning, Daryl packs up his belongings, including his wing vest, as well as the supplies that he's gathered from the boat, and traces a route on the boat owner's map from Marselle across to the other side of the country, the side closest to the 
United States of America
. Daryl records a message on the tape recorder as he leaves: 
"My name is Daryl Dixon. I come from a place called the 
Commonwealth
. It's in America. I went out looking for 
some
thing
. All I found was 
trouble
. If I don't make it back, I want them to know I tried. Hell, I'm still trying."


Daryl pulls a 
boat hook
 out of a nearby skeleton and sets off on his journey. Daryl's journey takes him across country, over the 
Pont du Gard
 and through various ruins until he finds an abandoned 
market
. As Daryl explores, he draws the attention of a nearby 
burner
 which knocks over a vase of flowers, alerting Daryl to its presence. A small 
herd
 of burners rises from various places around the market and Daryl quickly puts two of them down with his boat hook, the acidic blood of one sizzling as it hits the floor. As the fight continues, one grabs Daryl by the arm, burning his arm before Daryl manages to break free and put the burner down. Standing on a table, Daryl stabs several burners as they surround him, but his boat hook gets stuck when he stabs it through the table into a burner underneath. Daryl breaks off the hook of weapon while trying to free it, but he manages to finish off the last few burners with his 
knife
 and the broken end of the boat hook, throwing his knife into the head of the last burner. Retrieving his knife and examining the corpse, Daryl is shocked by the zombie's acidic blood as well as the hand shaped burn on his arm from being grabbed.

As Daryl continues his journey, he stops to treat his burn wound, observed by 
Isabelle
 from a nearby hill. In the window of the car that Daryl stops next to is a small sign reading 
"dieu vous aime"
. Although Daryl spots his watcher, he chooses to ignore them and continue with his journey, stopping by a sign that shows that Lourdes is 15 kilometers away while two other locations, partially faded away, are 28 and 55 kilometers away respectively, also with a small sign below the town names. Using a French to English dictionary, Daryl translates the sign out loud as 
"
God
 loves you"
 and, with a final look at Isabelle, he resumes walking. Isabelle posts another sign and then departs herself.

Daryl reaches a farm where he spots 
Maribelle
 working and accidentally trips an alarm as he backs away. Maribelle is joined by the apparently blind 
Guillaume
 as she calls out to Daryl in French. After Daryl admits that he doesn't know French, Maribelle recognizes him as American and reveals herself to speak English. Daryl hesitantly approaches the pair as Maribelle introduces Guillaume as her grandfather who only speaks a little English and has an injured ankle. The pair offer to trade an apple or a rabbit for medical supplies and Daryl makes the trade. Daryl explains that he intends to return to America and Maribelle introduces herself and Guillaume, asking to go together, suggesting that they can help each other. Much to Maribelle's amusement, as Guillaume always talks about World War II, her grandfather brings up their countries like friends and fighting together. However, Daryl just packs up the pair's apples and Guillaume accuses him of being no friend to which Daryl retorts that there's no more countries either.

A jeep arrives with 
Henri
 and 
Michel
 who force Daryl to disarm himself and sit down. After a heated exchange, Michel grabs Maribelle and begins dragging her off. Drawing his knife, Daryl overpowers Henri and stabs him in the throat, holding the dying man as a human shield. Michel shoots at Daryl, slightly grazing his neck and causing him to drop Henri. As Michel prepares to shoot Daryl, Maribelle hits him from behind with Henri's 
spear
, subduing him. Before Daryl can shoot the man, Maribelle tells him to save the powder and impales Michel in the chest with the spear, killing him in 
revenge
 for what he had tried to do to her. Revealing himself to have been faking his blindness and his injury, Guillaume hits Daryl from behind with his walking stick before he and Maribelle begin to rob Daryl of all of his belongings and Maribelle stabs Henri in the head in order to keep him from reanimating. As Daryl passes out, Isabelle enters and scares off the thieves with a gunshot.

As Daryl lies unconscious, he flashes back to promising Judith, who tells Daryl that he deserves a happy ending too, to find 
Rick
 and 
Michonne
 and bring them home and saying goodbye to 
Carol
 before setting off on his journey. A disoriented Daryl wakes in an abbey where a couple of nuns tend to him, cauterizing Daryl's burn with a hot poker. Daryl's screams distract the other nuns before 
Véronique
 draws their attention back to their singing.

Daryl awakens tied to a bed and Isabelle, now dressed in her nun's clothes, introduces herself and reassures Daryl that he's a guest, having only been tied up for his own safety. Isabelle tells Daryl that he's lucky to still have his arm as Daryl had a wound from a burner and cauterization is the best way to prevent the spread of it and that they call zombies 
"the hungry ones"
 in France with burners being just one kind. As she checks on Daryl's wound, Isabelle explains that they're a small community of nuns, very small now after 12 years of the outbreak, which survives by farming, gardening and scavenging. Having found Daryl's tape recorder, Isabelle knows that he's from the Commonwealth in America and asks how he came to be in France, but Daryl only tells her that it was 
"a bunch of bad decisions."
 With the cauterization holding, Isabelle tells him to clean up so that he can avoid infection from the wound. As Isabelle leaves to get more bandages, locking him in, Daryl tells her that she can call him Daryl rather than Mr. Dixon. Looking out the window, Daryl observes the nuns playing around with a young boy who is dressed up pretending to be a knight. Daryl falls asleep in the bathtub and has a nightmare of floating in the ocean.

When he wakes up again, Isabelle brings Daryl some new clothes and uses honey garlic to treat his head wound in order to fight infection. Looking at the wall decorations, Daryl quips that the nuns have kept all of their options open, and Isabelle explains that, over the years, the abbey has become a part of a group called the 
Union of Hope
 which is open to all messengers of faith and perseverance. The Union believes that humanity is enduring a test from which they will soon be delivered. Daryl admits that he's never put much stock in God, but Isabelle tells him that God has put stock in him. Isabelle asks about the scars on his back, and Daryl tells her that 
his father
 was a smoker and he used to have 
a brother
 with Isabelle in turn revealing that she had a sister. Daryl notices scars on Isabelle's wrist, and she tells him that the 
"parish priest used to say our scars show that we have suffered, but more importantly, that we have healed from our suffering."


Isabelle shows Daryl around the abbey, and he asks about the little boy that he saw. Isabelle explains that 
Laurent
 grew up there, having been orphaned. The other nuns are afraid of Daryl, but he reassures Isabelle that he'll be gone soon. Daryl comes across the abbey's armory and Isabelle explains that medieval churches often had weapons rooms because they were often needed back then and the nuns have trained themselves to use the medieval weapons stored there, just in case. Daryl is impressed by the killer nuns with Isabelle confirming that they can defend themselves if they need to. Daryl notices a medieval gun collection and Isabelle explains that 
Père Jean
 was a collector as his grandfather fought in the Marquis with the missing gun being the one that Isabelle uses. Daryl checks out Père Jean's office behind the armory and asks if the nun knows how to use the CB radio inside. Isabelle admits that it's been awhile since she's been able to reach anyone on it and agrees to let Daryl give it a try once he gets better. Locking the door, Isabelle offers to try reaching out to a Spainard that she had spoken to a few months ago who speaks a bit of English. Isabelle's own English is good as her parents worked for Médecins Sans Frontières and they traveled all over including to Bosnia, Chechnya and Rwanda. Isabelle and her sister finished up their schooling in Paris and she ended up at the abbey because of a bunch of good decisions.

Continuing the tour, Isabelle explains that the abbey was already being modernized before she came with the hope of converting the land into an agricultural property that would support them and fund their mission which has been enough to keep the nuns going. Seeing Véronique signaling her over, Isabelle tells Daryl to take a seat while she talks to the Mother Superior. 
Sylvie
 brings Daryl a tray of food and he observes the goings on of the abbey with Laurent watching and mirroring Daryl's actions from across the way. Véronique berates Isabelle, telling her that Daryl doesn't belong here, but Isabelle defends asks what good are they if they can't offer shelter to a wounded pilgrim. Véronique realizes that Isabelle thinks that Daryl might be 
"the one"
 which she confirms, having seen Daryl fight the guerriers and how strong he is. However, Véronique believes that Daryl belongs out there with the faithless and the violent and not with them, calling Daryl a person who lives without God. Isabelle simply retorts that so was she once.

Laurent approaches Daryl with a completed Rubik's cube and tells him to try it out, stating that his record is 3 minutes and 12 seconds. Daryl returns the cube, telling the boy that he's not good at shit like that. Laurent reveals that he's incredibly intelligent and good at math problems, science, music, geography, and he knows all of the countries and the capitals from back in the Before Time, having been taught by Père Jean. Laurent officially introduces himself to Daryl and asks how many people he thinks lives within the boundaries of what was once France. When Daryl simply shrugs, Laurent speculates a current French population of fewer than 200,000 starting from 67 million people before the Fall. Daryl admits that he was going to say much less than that, and Laurent tells him that it will take six generations, perhaps seven, to repopulate that many people which greatly bothers Laurent, something that Daryl agrees with. Laurent asks if Daryl has children, parents, or a wife, noting that Daryl is homesick when Daryl states that he doesn't have anything like that. Stating that he feels things in his stomach like Daryl's sadness, Laurent encourages Daryl not to despair as he deserves a happy ending too, echoing what Judith had told Daryl before his departure. Laurent is called away for poetry with Père Jean and leaves Daryl with his Rubik's cube to try.

Daryl tries to pick the lock on the priest's office before hearing a walker growling and Laurent talking. Daryl is shocked to find Laurent reading to a walker locked up in a cell and the boy explains that the walker is Père Jean, and they are waiting for him to rise again. Isabelle joins them and she orders Laurent to wait for her in the garden and attempts to explain to Daryl who is uninterested, telling her that 
"you've got a lot of witchy shit going on around here. Dead priest in a closet and a creepy kid? No thanks."


Daryl begins packing up, but Isabelle insists that he can't leave without them and that the nuns have been waiting for him. Isabelle calls Daryl the messenger to deliver Laurent and shows him a crude drawing of Daryl on the beach, something that the boy had drawn three weeks ago, before Daryl ever came to the abbey. Daryl is dubious of the importance of Laurent having drawn a guy on a beach, but Isabelle has seen Daryl fight the gurreiers and she knows that Daryl can get Laurent there safely. Their leader is a Buddhist monk who came through on a pilgrimage some years ago and recognized something in Laurent which the nuns believe to be an answer to a prophecy. The Union of Hope has a base up north with a community that will raise and nurture the boy to be who he was born to be. Six months before, 
Lama Rinpoche
 said that it was time and Père Jean was supposed to escort him, but he died and reanimated with a disgusted Daryl noting that the nuns think that prayers and poetry is gonna fix him. In the armory, Daryl gathers more weapons including a 
crossbow
, a knife and a 
morning star
 while Isabelle continues trying to convince him. Isabelle insists that Laurent is special, having lost his mother in childbirth which he shouldn't have survived, but he did. Laurent has shown abilities, perception and compassion beyond any child and he sees into people. Daryl sarcastically remarks that he knew a kid like that in grade school who got his ass kicked a lot. Isabelle tells Daryl that Laurent needs teaching and guidance that the nuns can't provide, and he'll be safer with the Union and nurtured until he's ready to be the new Messiah and lead the revival of humanity.

Entering Père Jean's office, Isabelle tells Daryl that this is why Daryl is here, why he washed ashore, why she was on the road that day and why Daryl was saved, stating that everything happens for a reason. Daryl tries to get the radio working, but Isabelle admits that the tube broke a month ago and she has been trying to get a replacement. Daryl accuses Isabelle of fucking with him, and she tells him that there's a port up north that might still be active, 
Le Havre
, and she shows Daryl it on a wall map. The nuns have heard rumors of ships that come and go, but it's just rumors. Daryl asks about a route that's marked out on the map leading to 
Paris
 and Isabelle explains that it's Père Jean's plan to get Laurent up north showing stops, places where they have friends who can help connect them and radio frequencies. Isabelle warns Daryl that it's a treacherous path north and hard to find your way, especially for someone who doesn't speak French. Without a word, Daryl grabs his weapons and leaves the room.

As Isabelle continues to try to convince him to stay, Daryl makes his way out of the abbey, telling the nun that it's going to be fine and Laurent like it here, noting that the kid is safe, and he got lucky. However, Isabelle counters that Laurent is lonely, having grown up with no friends or father figure. Laurent needs other children and teachers, but Daryl thinks that staying alive is more important. Isabelle insists that Laurent has a greater destiny than just surviving, with Laurent calling out a goodbye to Daryl from nearby, promising that they will meet again. Isabelle admits that Laurent doesn't know about any of their plan as he's too young and it's too much to put on him. However, Daryl has already made plans and he isn't looking to make any more. 
"The world is lost. We know that. Hope fades gradually, and then all at once. If we're wrong, at least you will have helped a boy get to a better place. But if we're right... why not bet on hope?"
 pleads Isabelle. Stating that it's not his problem, Daryl leaves and Véronique tells Isabelle that there's no shame in wanting it to be so, but Daryl left so he's not the one. A short way down the road, Daryl is forced to take cover as vehicles carrying guerriers from the 
Power of the Living
 drive towards the abbey. Realizing that the nuns are in trouble, Daryl hesitates to go.

Laurent and Isabelle struggle with 
Martin
 as he tries to drag the boy away. As Martin prepares to hit Isabelle with the butt of his rifle, Daryl suddenly throws an axe into his back, killing Martin, before running away. Isabelle flees with Laurent and 
Stéphane
 sends 
Richard
, 
Jèrèmie
 and another guerrier after them and the sisters while the rest go with Stéphane after Daryl. In the courtyard, Sylvie and eight other nuns confront the three men armed with a variety of weapons. In the battle that follows, Sylvie stabs Jèrèmie to death and attacks the other guerrier, but most of the nuns are down by the men's gunfire. Inside, Stéphane, Philippe and another guerrier split up to look for Daryl, but Daryl manages to ambush and kill the third man while Stéphane and Philippe are elsewhere. Outside, Isabelle grabs the axe from Martin's back to join the fight after having hidden Laurent away.

Seeing the guerrier fall, Stéphane and Philippe search the room for Daryl, splitting up again. Daryl ambushes Philippe, knocking the young man's rifle from his hands with a morning star and using him as a human shield when Stéphane shoots at him, causing Stéphane to accidentally kill his comrade. Daryl and Stéphane engage in a brief fight that ends with the guerrier viscously kicking Daryl and retrieving his gun to shoot him. However, Isabelle knocks Stéphane's gun from his hand with the axe and he flees. Grabbing the gun, Daryl shoots at Stéphane, hitting him in the shoulder, and chasing Stéphane despite a mortally wounded Véronique's attempts to stop him. Daryl runs out of bullets before he catches up with Stéphane and can only watch him make an escape in one of the Power of the Living's jeeps. In the courtyard, Daryl finds Richard, Jèrèmie and the other guerrier dead, along with the eight other nuns, having killed each other in the battle aside from Sylvie. Seeing a zombified Martin approaching, Daryl picks up a dropped gun and shoots Martin in the head, blowing the top of his head apart and putting him down.

Inside, Daryl finds Isabelle tending to the dying Mother Superior. Taking Daryl's hand, Véronique tells him that 
"you never believed. Maybe you never saw a reason to. But one thing I know -- reasons are everywhere."
 Sylvie and Laurent join them and Véronique calls the boy the cure for a sick world, acknowledging that perhaps Daryl is the one after all before dying of her wounds, much to everyone's grief.

That night, Daryl and Isabelle join Sylvie and Laurent by a fire and Isabelle tells Sylvie that they've buried the nuns. Stating that the nuns are with the angels now, Laurent wonders if they're lost now, but Isabelle reassures him that they're never lost. Accompanied by Laurent on guitar, Sylvie begins singing. Recalling that she'd asked him how he got here, Daryl explains to Isabelle that 
"I left home, looking for something. I figured there had to be something out there worth finding. And I ran into some bad people. They put me on a boat. That didn't go well. And I washed ashore here, and I ran into a nun."
 After Isabelle confirms that she can take him to the port, Daryl agrees to take the group where they need to go. Stéphane watches the abbey from nearby before hobbling back to his jeep, still intent upon revenge on Daryl.

At Le Havre, a ship's 
captain
 explains to guerriers that they were in the Gulf of Cadiz when the prisoners escaped, and it was beyond their control. Genet joins them, asking the captain who is in control of his ship if not him. The man insists that a captain is only as good as his crew, and Genet recalls that her father fished these waters for days at a time in a small trawler, knowing only one thing no matter how hard it got: the crew is only as good as their captain. 
Dr. Lafleur
 reports that their research is largely destroyed, but some of the test subjects may still be of use to them as five chained up walkers are led onto the dock. Whoever did this made a real mess of things for them, and Genet is angered that after three years to get this ship seaworthy, things have been messed up because of one American. The captain states that they did manage to stop the 
mutiny
 while the American went overboard and is presumed dead by him. Genet is obviously doubtful that the man is dead and the captain reveals that the American responsible is Daryl Dixon. Calling it a start, Genet orders 
one
 of her men to find Daryl if he's not dead and leaves. 



"
Alouette
"


Laurent
 plays in a field while Daryl and 
Isabelle
 go over their route to Paris on a map. While Daryl wants to take a route that's a straight shot to Paris, Isabelle wants to detour to 
Angers
 where there's a man with a radio who can connect them to the 
Union of Hope
's people in the north. Daryl argues against it as Paris was the priest's plan and going to Angers will take longer, but Isabelle simply tells him that the plan has changed.

Daryl, Isabelle, Laurent and 
Sylvie
 ride a mule-drawn cart through 
a village
 where Laurent rather morbidly answers Sylvie's attempt to get him to guess what person she's talking about by stating that it's a dead person since everyone else that Sylvie knows is dead. When Laurent asks what kind of a death he would prefer, Daryl sarcastically suggests a quiet one. The mule suddenly stops in the middle of the road and refuses to go any further. 
Astérix
's whining draws out a 
herd
 and Daryl wonders how to shut him up, but Laurent tells him that the mule is very stubborn. With no other choice and over Isabelle's objections that Laurent loves the mule, Daryl unties Astérix and fires his gun into the air, scaring the mule into charging straight through the herd, drawing it away. Isabelle lies to Laurent that Astérix will be fine as he's faster than the walkers, and Daryl has everyone gather their belongings and move out in the other direction.

On the road, Laurent continues to express concern for Astérix, but Isabelle reassures him that the mule is too smart to get lost and that he probably went to the apple orchard that they had passed. However, Daryl urges Isabelle to tell the boy the truth as he has to learn sometime. Recognizing that Daryl doesn't have children of his own, Isabelle tells him that the truth can wait. Suddenly, the sound of whistling surrounds 
the group
 before an arrow flies into a pole in front of them. Daryl chases the shooter into a nearby building where he's ambushed and captured by a group of masked children armed with makeshift 
spears
.

Having captured the entire group and their cart, the children lead them to a fortified 
preschool
 where they chant and howl as their leader 
Lou
 comes to join them. Isabelle explains that they're 
religious
 people whose mule broke down and they got stuck. After Isabelle clarifies that they're nuns, Lou challenges them to be able to recite St. Joseph's prayer for mothers and fathers which Isabelle, Sylvie and Laurent immediately do, although Daryl, unable to understand the conversation, doesn't. When questioned about Daryl, Isabelle claims that he's an American priest named Father Daryl who was sent to France on a mission long, but he doesn't speak French, even after all of this time. Satisfied, Lou has Daryl released and his weapons returned, announcing to the children that they will practice their English out of respect to Daryl. Daryl is unamused about being dubbed Father Daryl by Isabelle.

Lou shows the group around the classrooms, explaining that there's 18 children now. The day that the outbreak started, the older children were dropped off at school, but while some of them were picked up at the end of the day, the parents of the rest never came. After briefly stopping to admonish 
Criquet
 who is supposed to be helping to cook dinner, Lou tells Isabelle that the younger children, two of whom attach themselves to Daryl, are orphans that they've found over the years. 
Carine
 was left at the school in a basket and 
Dmitri
 was found lost in the woods. They survive by hunting, growing food and fixing old clothes as well as keeping up with their lessons. Daryl compliments that they're 
"not bad for being little road bandits."


Lou takes them into a room where an old woman, 
Madame Dubois
, lies in a bed. Lou explains that she is their parents and nurse and taught them everything before she got 
sick
 six months ago. The children read to Madame DuBois and sing and recite a prayer from Isaiah for the sick and dying, although Lou believes that their prayers will be answered, and Madame DuBois will be saved. Although Daryl and Isabelle don't say anything, the grave look that they share with each other shows that they know that Madame DuBois won't survive.

Everyone sits down together to a dinner cooked by 
Aline
, the children's chef. Laurent tries to sit next to 
Moof
 and make conversation with him, but Moof angrily rejects Laurent's overtures, telling the younger boy that the chair is for his brother. Lou apologizes, explaining that two of their brothers are off on a mission right now. Lou asks "Father Daryl" to lead them in a prayer of thanks which he awkwardly does: 
"um, Lord... I'm sure you have your reasons for turning the whole world upside down. Maybe we deserve it, for being so mean to each other. We probably do deserve it. But not tonight. No. Tonight is good. And if this isn't good enough for you, I don't know what is. Amen."
 The kids are impressed as Daryl sounds like Madame DuBois who says that their manners are like a mirror that shows their portrait. Daryl proceeds to just slurp his soup with the kids following suit with a laugh.

After dinner, Lou asks what they will do now that they've lost their mule, but Laurent tells her that the mule isn't lost but eating apples, causing the other kids to laugh at him before Aline leads Laurent away. Daryl asks where they can find another one and Moof suggests La Tarasque which Sylvie explains is a lizard, like a dragon from old stories. However, this one is not a story, but rather he's a real man, although he's still a monster. La Tarasque lives in a nearby castle and he has horses that he used to take everything from the village such as food and fuel from every house and every shop. The kids once tried a raid to get supplies, but it didn't work out well for them. Lou refuses to Daryl where this castle is, telling him that it's too dangerous and they won't go there again. Daryl suggests that they could save Madame DuBois since if La Tarasque raided all of the drugstores, then he's got all of the medicine. The kids can pray all that they like, but Madame DuBois will die without proper medicine. Moof wants to join them, and he angrily storms off when Lou refuses to let him join them, agreeing to go with Daryl by herself in the morning.

That night, everyone gathers to watch 
Mork & Mindy
 which is powered by 
Sacha
 pedaling on a bike. Initially excited, Daryl slowly gets more somber as the show goes on which Isabelle notices. Lying in bed later, Daryl admits that he lied, and medicine won't help Madame Dubois, but they just need that horse. Daryl quotes Isabelle about how the truth can wait, but Isabelle tells him that it was a mule before while this is the children's teacher. Daryl states that they just need to get to the radio, which is too far to walk, and Isabelle recognizes that it's so that he can go home. Isabelle feels sorry for the children who don't know what the world was like before, but Daryl sadly points out that you can't miss what you never had. Daryl reveals that he had used to watch 
Mork & Mindy
 with 
Merle
 when they were young. Daryl and Merle had loved that show which used to make everything just a little bit better for them. Isabelle admits that she understands wanting to escape.

On the road the next morning, Lou reveals that she knows that Daryl's not a priest as it's pretty obvious. Daryl tells the girl that how he got to France is a long story and the only part that matters is that Daryl gets home to 
his people
. Lou quotes Madame DuBois that family are the people that you're with, and Daryl admits that she sounds like she was a good teacher. However, Lou still believes that Madame DuBois will get better thanks to Daryl and Lou tells him that they're almost there.

As they come within sight of 
La Tarasque's Castle
, Daryl asks Lou about the raid that she had talked about, and she explains that three of the kids, including herself, went after La Tarasque and only she ever came home. One of the others who went was Moof's brother and Lou has been lying to the others that Moof's brother and the other kid went for help and that they'll come back. With Madame DuBois sick, she didn't know what else to say which Daryl gets. The two find the castle's drawbridge up and the moat filled with a 
herd
 of walkers.

In a toolshed, Daryl and Lou look for something to help them cross the moat. Although they find a rope and something to use as a hook, Daryl asks Lou to find a bigger one, and then locks her in, telling Lou that she'll be safer in there and Daryl is better off on his own. Daryl uses his makeshift rope and hook to climb the drawbridge, and finds a storeroom loaded with supplies that he begins gathering. Daryl hears a voice from another room yelling at La Tarasque to be let out, and finds a teenage boy locked in a dungeon who reveals that he speaks English. Daryl realizes that it's one of the kids from the raid and the boy introduces himself as 
Hérisson
 which Daryl has trouble pronouncing, leading him to call the boy Hedgehog - the English translation of his name - instead.

As they try to leave, La Tarasque opens fire on them from a window. Daryl shows Hérisson how to use his rifle and orders the boy to keep La Tarasque busy while Daryl rushes inside to confront the man. In the toolshed, Lou is found and released by a hooded figure. As La Tarasque exchanges shots and insults with Hérisson, Daryl sneaks up on the man and forces him to disarm himself at knifepoint. The surprised man reveals himself to be an American from Giddings, Texas named 
R.J. Gaines
. Although RJ offers Daryl some of the amenities that he has, Daryl furiously confronts RJ about stealing it from people who need it. RJ defends himself as just doing whatever it takes to stick it out long enough until he can get back home to the ones that he loves, just like everyone else which is all that matters. Daryl drags RJ outside where he claims to have never laid a hand on a furious Hérisson, but the boy points out that RJ had threatened to shoot him if he tried to leave. While Hérisson wants to push RJ into the moat, Daryl decides to take him back to Lou and let her decide what to do with RJ. RJ begs him not to as the kids will kill him and he's got a wife and four kids of his own waiting for him back home, but Daryl tells him that 
"there ain't no home, asshole"
 as he's been there and that 
"East Coast, Midwest, even 
Texas
. Everybody you know back home is gone. They've been gone a long time."


Daryl and Hérisson lead a horse-drawn cart full of supplies over the lowered drawbridge, dragging RJ, tied by a long rope to the back of the cart, behind them. RJ desperately continues trying to bribe an uninterested Daryl before the side of the cart falls open and several large fuel tanks roll out and into the moat. As RJ taunts them, Daryl goes to secure the remaining supplies and try to fix the damaged wheel and he orders Hérisson to shoot RJ if he tries anything. RJ continues taunting the two, offering to help them if they let him go. RJ makes a run for Daryl's gun and the two men struggle over it, eventually falling off the edge of the drawbridge and into the moat.

Daryl immediately draws his 
knife
 and 
morning star
 to fight the walkers, but RJ is left dangling helpless within the herd's reach from the rope that he's still attached to. The walkers devour RJ while Daryl retrieves his rifle and shoots the fuel canisters, causing a large explosion that blows up a large number of the walkers, including the walkers gathering behind Daryl while Daryl is protected by crouching behind the corner of the wall. Moof tosses down a rope from the top of the wall while Lou and Hérisson cover Daryl from the surviving walkers with 
bows
. Once Daryl's tied onto the rope, Moof has the horse pull him out of the moat. Lou sarcastically asks Daryl if he's still better off by himself and notes that Daryl at least got his horse. Hérisson shows a grateful Lou that Daryl got them the medical supplies that they need too. A horrified Moof recognizes one of the walkers in the moat as his brother 
Julien
 and realizes that Lou had lied to him about Julien being off on a mission. Moof refuses to leave his brother like that, and an emotional Lou raises her bow, but struggles to bring herself to shoot her friend. Sympathetic, Daryl shoots Julien with his 
crossbow
 instead and saves Lou from having to put her friend down.

Daryl, Lou, Moof and Hérisson triumphantly return to the school where the other children celebrate the return of their lost friend. Isabelle notes that Daryl's lie worked and Daryl quips that 
"well, I ain't a nun"
 as they watch the celebration. Sylvie comes out with the news that Madame DuBois has died of her illness, and Daryl apologetically admits to the devastated Lou that the meds were never going to help her and that he had lied to get a horse. Lou wonders what they're going to do without her, and Daryl tells the girl to keep doing what they've been doing. The other kids look up to Lou and that's a good thing. Daryl offers to take care of putting Madame DuBois down, but Lou decides to do it herself as she owes it to the old woman. Daryl, Isabelle and Sylvie leave Lou alone as she draws her knife and says goodbye to Madame DuBois before stabbing her in the head. The children build a memorial to their beloved teacher and Laurent comforts Hibou, telling her that his teacher is also with the angels and then leads the kids in doing 
"nanu-nanu
" from 
Mork & Mindy
.

Daryl boards the group's now horse-drawn cart, but Laurent wants to stay at the school with his new friends. Laurent reluctantly agrees to leave, complaining to Sylvie that Isabelle never listens to him and deciding to walk instead. The children see Daryl's group off as they leave and resume their journey to Paris.

A limping 
Stéphane
 walks through the abandoned abbey, stopping briefly to look at the corpses of his men who were just left lying in the courtyard. Stéphane finds an abandoned gun as well as Daryl's tape recorder and listens to the message that he had recorded on it. Looking through a journal, Stéphane finds a picture of a 2 month old Laurent as well as the wall map showing the group's route to Paris.

On the road, Sylvie tries to get Laurent to get in the cart, but he refuses as Isabelle treats him like a baby. Laurent states that some adults speak the truth and some children don't need to be treated like that, but Sylvie argues that he's not like other children and Laurent is special. Giving Isabelle the reins, Daryl joins the boy on foot, telling Laurent that no one had ever called Daryl special when he was a kid, at least not in a good way. However, Laurent doesn't want to be special, he just wants to be like other kids which Daryl knows. Laurent wonders what it is that makes him so special anyways.



"
Paris Sera Toujours Paris
"


Daryl's group
 arrives in 
Angers
 where 
Isabelle
 tells Daryl they can radio for directions on where they should head next. Stopping in front of a theater, Daryl leaves the reins with 
Laurent
 and a rifle with 
Sylvie
 to protect the horse.

Inside, Isabelle explains that her contact in Angers is a musician who has been living in this theater for years. 
The Conductor
 joins them, revealing that he speaks English, and leads them to his radio which has some parts missing. The Conductor explains that he used some parts for amplification. The Conductor puts on a record, and he leads Daryl and Isabelle into the main part of the theater where he excitedly conducts an orchestra made out of mutilated walkers tied up to various instruments, having clearly gone 
insane
.

Outside, Laurent and Sylvie listen to the music with confusion as a walker, dragging a corpse that's been manacled to it, approaches. A frustrated Daryl states that they should've stuck to the plan, calling it a stupid detour, but Isabelle believes that it was worth a try. As Isabelle struggles to shoot the walker, Daryl and Isabelle emerge from the theater, arguing about going to 
Paris
 which Isabelle believes to be too dangerous. 
"It's too dangerous everywhere. We did it your way. Now we're gonna do it mine. We're going to Paris,"
 Daryl proclaims, taking the rifle from Sylvie and shooting the walker in the head. The group rides off in their cart as a 
herd
 approaches, drawn by the music and the gunshot.

Walking alongside the cart, Laurent asks Daryl if there will be walkers in Paris which Daryl confirms is likely to be the case. Laurent notes that Daryl is good at fighting them, but Daryl dismissively tells him that everyone is good at something. Daryl brings the cart to a stop as Laurent looks out over Paris from a nearby vantage point and Daryl welcomes the two women home. The group makes their way through the walker-infested streets of Paris with Isabelle and Sylvie pointing out various landmarks to Laurent, including the 
Panthéon
 and the ruins of 
Notre-Dame
. Daryl notices the word "
Pouvoir
" and a crest written on a car and Isabelle explains that it's a movement that started after the start of the 
Trials
. Most of Paris is under the control of 
Genet
 and her guerriers which Daryl recognizes as the guys who had 
attacked
 the 
Abbey of Saint Bernadette
. In desperate times, people turn to order or to God.

As the group makes their way through the 
Père Lachaise Cemetery
, Laurent tells Daryl about the famous people buried there and about a fable that one of them had written about a weary woodsman who wanted to die, but had a change of heart when death came, instead asking for help carrying his burden so that he can keep going on. Daryl stops to pay his respects to the grave of Jim Morrison, an American rock star who had died in Paris. Noticing Daryl's worried look, Laurent reassures Daryl that he won't die in Paris too. A little further on, the group spots three bodies in the process of being buried and are confronted by the survivors burying them. Isabelle tells 
Fallou Boukar
, the man in charge, that truth is hope and that 
Père Jean
 had sent them. Fallou realizes who Laurent is and asks after Père Jean, but Isabelle admits that he isn't with them. Noticing Fallou's suspicious look at Daryl, Isabelle identifies Daryl as a friend who had helped them to get there and who only speaks English. Fallou introduces himself and his companions, telling Laurent that they've been waiting a long time to meet him.

Fallou leads the group to 
his community
 living on a greenhouse roof where Daryl asks for a radio that he can use. Fallou explains that they take turns at the daily tasks and had welcomed their 64th member a few months before who is a baby girl that was born. As Fallou shows them around, 
Emile
 asks Sylvie if she had always wanted to be a nun, and she admits that she's never imagined anything else. Emile comments that Sylvie has never been to Paris before and it's a good place to imagine. In the garden, the group observes the 
Eiffel Tower
 in the distance with Laurent telling Daryl how many rivets were used to build it and Daryl noticing that the famous landmark got the tip knocked off of it. Fallou explains that a military helicopter had crashed into it at the start of the outbreak and Laurent muses that 
"it must magical, to stand under it and look up at the sky."


At Daryl's prompting, Fallou leads Daryl and Isabelle to 
Antoine
 who is in charge of the community's homing pigeon method of communication, leaving Daryl incredulous. Antoine sends a message written by Isabelle out, but admits that it could be anywhere from a few days to a month to get a response factoring in 
bad weather
. After confirming with Isabelle that the 
Nest
 will take her the rest of the way for the last part of the trip, Daryl declares that his part of the job is done as a pigeon can't help him and without a radio, they can't help him. Fallou tells Daryl that there are people trading all kinds of things in Paris and he can take Daryl to them. However, they will need currency as even information is a commodity. Daryl is willing to steal something if that's what it takes, but Isabelle thinks that she knows where to find something, and they'll go there in the morning. The three observe people presenting Laurent with gifts and Daryl is worried that it's a lot to put on a kid, but Isabelle feels that God chooses our burdens. Laurent approaches 
Sonia
 whose husband had died a few days before and has refused any food or comfort since. While Sonia has been inconsolable to everyone else, she accepts a hug from the boy, causing Fallou to declare that Père Jean was right about him.

Daryl and Isabelle make their way through Isabelle's 
old apartment building
 which is filled with its zombified residents. The two find Isabelle's old apartment wrecked, but clear of any walkers. Daryl notes the 
"noisy neighbors"
 and Isabelle identifies them as the Garniers who had lived next door. Mrs. Gariner had always been trying to set Isabelle up with her son. Daryl finds a photo booth strip of Isabelle and 
Quinn
 in one of the books and Isabelle identifies Quinn, stating that she was young and very stupid, and Daryl suggests that she upgraded with God. Isabelle retrieves a picture of her sister 
Lily
 standing near the Eiffel Tower that was taken on Lily's 16th birthday and Laurent has never seen his mother's face. Stating that they're here so that she can keep her part of the bargain, Isabelle retrieves the box full of her stolen merchandise from the fireplace, including 
drugs
 and a gold watch, which they can use as trade to get them information on a boat. Seeing how surprised Daryl is by her loot, Isabelle quips that she wasn't always a nun.

Isabelle changes into some of her old clothes while Daryl enjoys the view from her apartment which beats the view from his old house. Isabelle recalls how there was a bar at the end of the street where only the regulars, which included artists, musicians and students, were allowed to stay when the owner pulled the curtains. They thought that they were reinventing the world while never imagining how it would get. Daryl points out that Isabelle at least thought about while Daryl himself didn't do much thinking back then. While Daryl seems like someone who is always thinking to Isabelle, he admits that he's not, things happen, and things change. 
"Maybe we're the same that way. Broken until the world ended,"
 suggests Isabelle which Daryl agrees is a possibility. Isabelle is glad that their paths crossed and Daryl, seeing a walker in an apartment across the way, decides that they should get going.

However, the two find the stairwell to be filled with walkers and Isabelle leads Daryl out through a service entrance in the back which is overgrown with vines. Outside, the two find a zombified young girl tangled in vines and 
missing her nose
. While Daryl draws 
his knife
 to put her down, Isabelle stops him, recognizing the young girl as her former neighbor 
Aimée
. The two skirt around Aimée, but the girl's attempts to reach out to Isabelle knock over some flowerpots, drawing attention to them. Zombified residents crash through their windows to get at Daryl and Isabelle as Daryl desperately tries to open a door which is blocked by more vines. As Isabelle is caught between a burner and a small herd of at least five walkers, Daryl suddenly impales the burner in the back with a makeshift 
spear
 and holds it up against the vines, using the burner to melt through them. Once the door is open, Daryl stabs the burner in the head, recovers his dropped knife, and he and Isabelle make their escape just as the small herd closes in on them. Isabelle stops to take one last look at the still trapped Aimée, remembering 
driving away
 from the little girl on 
Monument Day
 along with Quinn and Lily.

Waiting for the others to join them, Daryl expresses his condolences to Isabelle about Aimée and Isabelle sadly admits that she had left Aimée behind when the outbreak started. Sylvie, Laurent, Fallou and Emile join them, and Isabelle gives her nephew the picture of his mother which Laurent shares with Daryl. Fallou leads the group to the 
Paris Catacombs
 where the 
guard
 lets them in in exchange for the group putting their weapons in the freezer. Fallou explains to Daryl that the catacombs are where the 6 million people who died in the 
Black Death
 are buried. 
"America is an infant. But here, we survived many apocalypses. We will survive this one too,"
 states Fallou.

The group reaches the 
Demimonde
 nightclub where Fallou tells Daryl that people find all sorts of things there and since Daryl helped the 
Union of Hope
, they will help him in return. Fallou goes looking for some friends who might be able to tell something, while Isabelle explains to Laurent that it's a nightclub and that they used to have a lot of them. 
Coco
 welcomes to the stage 
Anna Valery
 and Laurent, Sylvie, and Emile enjoy her performance while Daryl and Isabelle admire a painting hanging on the wall that was saved from a museum. Sylvie and Emile dance together and Emile explains that his grandmother was an Argentinian refugee who had taught him two things: to dance and to fight for freedom.

Fallou calls Daryl and Isabelle over to 
Bernard
 where they explain that Daryl wants to go to America and, since Daryl came by sea, there must be ships sailing. Bernard acknowledges that they hear things and 
Rodo
 has Isabelle show them what's in her bag as someone watches them from a nearby balcony. Bernard is impressed with Isabelle's stash, and tells Daryl through Isabelle that he knows people that can help him. Once Daryl pays him, Bernard promises to take Daryl to a connection who can hook him up. Daryl refuses after seeing the looks that Bernard and Rodo are exchanging with a man across the room, suggesting that they're about to double cross him, and a fight breaks out between Daryl and Bernard after the latter pulls a knife on Daryl. Daryl quickly subdues Bernard before they are interrupted by Quinn, much to the shock of Isabelle. Reminding Bernard of the rules against weapons, Quinn 
slices the man's face
 in punishment before giving the knife to Coco.

Quinn greets Isabelle, admitting that it's strange to see her again after so many years and she tells him that her life took some turns. Isabelle identifies Daryl as her friend that she's traveling with, and Daryl explains that he's looking for a way back to America. Quinn reveals that it's not impossible to do and that he's heard things, while Anna finishes her performance and is complimented by Laurent on her singing. Laurent shares the picture of his mom with Anna and admits that he wants to see the Eiffel Tower in person himself some day like Lily did on her birthday. Anna gives the boy her Eiffel Tower necklace to remember his mother by.

Quinn agrees to ask around and see what he can find out for his old friend and rejects Isabelle's offer of bartering with him. Laurent shows them the necklace that Anna had given to him, drawing Quinn's attention when Isabelle reveals that he's Lily's son. Quickly pulling her friend aside, Isabelle orders Sylvie to take Laurent back to the rooftop with the others, promising to explain later. Daryl asks if his friend is alright, but she just tells him that they made a deal and she'll keep up her end of the deal since Daryl kept up his end of it. Daryl was right: it turns out that Isabelle does have connections in Paris.

Quinn brushes off Anna's romantic advances and leads Daryl and Isabelle to his office, explaining that the nightclub was originally a bunker in World War II that was occupied by both sides of the conflict. Isabelle refuses a glass of champagne and reveals to her former boyfriend that she became a nun, much to his surprise. Isabelle admits that Lily had died giving birth to her baby which Quinn appears to be genuinely upset by. Much to Daryl and Isabelle's shock, Quinn reveals that he's actually Laurent's father and he's angry that his son was kept from him. Isabelle admits that Lily had never told her and accuses Quinn of being responsible for her sister's death. Becoming aggressive while Isabelle becomes more nervous and submissive, Quinn reminds Isabelle that he'd saved her life after Isabelle had 
slit her wrists
 in the bathtub. Quinn makes it clear that he'll only help Daryl if Isabelle and Laurent stay with him, but Daryl refuses to abandon the two to Quinn for a boat.

Leaving, Daryl tries to reassure Isabelle that they all have bad things in their past that they're trying to run from, but Isabelle angrily tells him that she was wrong earlier about them being the same. However, Daryl knows that he's not the one that she's really angry at. Isabelle reminds Daryl that they're in Paris because Daryl had wanted to come and she's only trying to help Daryl keep his promise, accusing Daryl of only caring about that. Isabelle asked for his help because she needed it, but she doesn't and never did need a hero.

That night, lying in his bunk at Fallou's community, Laurent asks Sylvie what it will be like at the Nest, and she reassures him that it will be safe like it used to be at the abbey and there will be more people like them who believe the same thing. Laurent tells Sylvie that Sonia had told him that he had made her feel loved, and he doesn't know why. Sylvie explains that it's because Laurent gives people hope and leaves while Laurent studies the picture of his mother.

Daryl packs up his belongings and Isabelle apologizes for her earlier behavior, telling Daryl that she doesn't believe in coincidences and Isabelle believes that she had to come back to Paris to see Quinn again and find out the truth. Daryl brushes off Isabelle, telling her that she's got Fallou's people looking after her now and she doesn't need him anymore. Isabelle tells Daryl that Laurent will be sad to see him go, but Daryl just tells her to make something up since she's really good at that. Isabelle explains that she had never told Laurent the truth about his birth because everything about it was horrible such as the way that Lily died and the way that Laurent was born. Daryl asks what Isabelle will tell Laurent about Quinn because she needs to stop lying to him. Laurent deserves to know who he is, and he can then make up his own mind about what he wants to do. Isabelle accuses Daryl of not accepting how special he is, but Daryl tells her 
"he's a gift from God, right? Maybe that's something you need to believe, 'cause the world's so fucked up. Or maybe, he's just a regular kid. A regular kid that got lucky and lived. Maybe that's your miracle."
 Having overheard their argument, a furious Laurent tells Daryl and Isabelle that he hates them both and storms off.

Guerriers led by Stéphane burst in, demanding to know where the American is. Laurent escapes down some scaffolding while Stéphane spots Daryl and chases after him and Daryl orders Isabelle to get Laurent and meet him back at her apartment. Daryl reaches the edge of the roof and pauses after spotting a herd below before jumping across to the next building. As Daryl makes his way across the adjacent rooftop, Stéphane orders his men to track Daryl and follows Daryl across. Daryl ambushes Stéphane, knocking the man's feet out from under him with his 
morning star
 and then trying to stab him. The two men engage in a vicious fight that ends with Daryl strangling Stéphane from behind. However, before Daryl can kill the man, the guerriers open fire on him, forcing Daryl to grab his weapons and flee. Isabelle runs through the building, calling for Laurent. As Daryl hides, the roof beneath him suddenly gives way and Daryl falls into the building below. 



"
La Dame de Fer
"


Walking through some underground tunnels, Daryl reaches a locked gate and while he tries to figure out a way through, a 
herd
 approaches from down the tunnel on the other side of the gate. 
Laurent
 walks out of a side tunnel in front of the walkers and Daryl desperately calls out to the boy who clasps his hands and bows his head in prayers as the herd passes him and surrounds him. The herd ignores Daryl, turning around and surrounding Laurent again instead. When the herd clears away, Daryl is shocked to find the boy standing completely unharmed by the walkers. Daryl calls to Laurent who simply turns and walks away from him without a word.

After falling through a roof, Daryl awakens underwater and finds a 
burner
 approaching him. Daryl quickly draws 
his knife
 and stabs the burner in the head, only to have a second grab onto his foot and try to chew through Daryl's shoe. Daryl stabs the second burner in the head, swims to the surface, and pulls himself out of the water, watching the 
rain
 coming in through the hole in the roof.

The next day, Daryl crosses the 
Pont de la Tournelle
 and makes his way through 
Paris
, spotting a woman playing a cello in her apartment and an elderly couple sitting together on their balcony even as walkers move around below -- life continues on in the City of Lights, even in the midst of 
a zombie apocalypse
. Hiding from a passing motorcyclist, Daryl checks his position on a nearby map of the city and isn't happy about what he sees.

Daryl continues to move through the city, hiding as he hears a bicycle approaching. The rider proves to be 
Antoine
 with his pigeons and Antoine is surprised but pleased to see Daryl still alive. Antoine explains that the 
Power of the Living
 wants the boy and they had come back to the community later in the night. The Guerriers had taken some of the people while the rest had run. The Union and the Power of the Living are enemies, and Laurent is the Union's hope. Daryl asks for directions to Rue Manuel, having become lost, and Antoine points him in the right direction and offers Daryl the use of his bike.

Noticing Guerriers approaching in a vehicle, Daryl leans the bike up against a wall and ducks into hiding with the old man. The vehicle stops and a 
Guerrier
 grabs the cages containing Antoine's pigeons. Ignoring Daryl's attempts to stop him, the frantic old man runs out in front of the jeep and pleads with the Guerriers to release his pigeons. Finally, the 
driver
 tells Antoine that 
"your pigeons are going to taste great,"
 before shooting the old man in the chest. As the Guerrier laughs, the furious Daryl flings his knife into the man's chest, killing him, and then hits the second Guerrier in the head with 
his
 
morning star
 as he emerges from the jeep.

Daryl checks up on the barely alive Antoine who begs Daryl to free the birds. Realizing that his friend isn't going to make it, Daryl retrieves the bird cages and, with Antoine too weak to do it by himself, Daryl helps him to release the pigeons to fly free. Antoine dies and Daryl sadly prepares his morning star to bash his friend's head in in order to keep Antonie from reanimating.

Daryl enters 
Isabelle
's 
apartment
 where he finds her waiting for him. Isabelle hugs Daryl and admits that she doesn't know where Laurent is, having been searching for the boy all night long. Daryl is sure that he's fine as Laurent is a smart kid, so he is most likely running and hiding. Isabelle points out that he doesn't know Paris, but Daryl has an idea of where Laurent may have gone.

Laurent makes his way through the city, avoiding a herd moving through the streets. Elsewhere, Isabelle worries that Laurent won't be where Daryl thinks that he will be, but Daryl is sure that the boy will be there. Daryl tells Isabelle that this is on both of them, and he had said some things back at the community that he shouldn't have said and Laurent heard him. Isabelle states that Laurent ran away because he was confused, and she should've been honest with him a long time ago. 
"Well, you got one thing right. Paris kinda sucks,"
 Daryl quips as walkers move behind them in the distance.

Laurent approaches the broken 
Eiffel Tower
 and looks at the picture of 
his mother
 near it. Underneath the structure is a barricade of sandbags at what appears to be a former military checkpoint which Laurent approaches after hearing noise from behind it. Looking through a small hole in the barricade, Laurent draws the attention of a walker on the other side of it. The barricade is actually containing a massive herd of walkers that are gathered below the Eiffel Tower, all of whom turn their attention to the living boy on the other side of the barricade. To the left and right, walkers break through the barricade while the herd pushes down the sandbags. The herd surrounds Laurent on all sides, quickly leaving him trapped.

Seeing the situation as they approach, Daryl quickly hands Isabelle his knife and fights the walkers with his morning star, taking out a number of them as Isabelle stabs a few with his knife. Hiding underneath a piece of sheet metal, a terrified Laurent watches as his friend and his aunt battle the herd in order to rescue him. A walker finds Laurent hiding and reaches for him, but it is suddenly stabbed through the head by 
Armand
 who grabs the boy and drags him to a nearby vehicle while 
another man
 shoots walkers who get too close to them. Seeing Laurent's predicament, Daryl throws both men off of him, causing the man with the gun to get devoured by the herd, but a third man drives away with Laurent before Daryl can stop him while the shocked Isabelle holds Armand at gunpoint.

Inside of a building at the 
Père Lachaise Cemetery
, Isabelle introduces herself to Armand who sarcastically does the same in return. Isabelle explains that she actually is a nun and, noticing Armand's medallion, asks if he is religious in return. Armand admits that he used to be, and Isabelle realizes that the man is not a Guerrier, asking if he's a Power of the Living officer instead, someone who works directly for Genet. Isabelle points out that all of the violence and the killing must take quite a toll, but Armand simply states that he sleeps at night. Isabelle offers him the chance to repent by revealing where Laurent has been taken, after which Armand can walk away knowing that he's still capable of grace and mercy. 
"Shame, really. They told me that it's a real party with ol' Isa. But all I'm getting is bullshit about God and Jesus. But the joke is, I know you're just a thieving little slut,
" taunts Armand, spitting on the ground. A shocked Isabelle realizes from Armand's mention of her past that it's actually Quinn who is behind Laurent's kidnapping and not Genet.

Armand asks Isabelle if Daryl knows about her and about the kind of girl that she used to be. Armand challenges Isabelle to tell Daryl before revealing in English that Isabelle used to be a very bad girl. Unbothered by the revelation, Daryl has Isabelle ask Armand what Quinn wants with the boy, but he refuses to cooperate. 
"You know, where I grew up, there was this little boy. Lived down the street. His name was Jimmy. Jimmy was a runt. They always picked on Jimmy for being so little. His dad, his dad was a 
drunk
. I don't think I ever saw that guy sober. One Christmas, Jimmy got a piglet as a present. It used to follow him around like a little dog. Even waited for him after school. And then, one Christmas, his dad says he wants him to kill the piglet and eat it for church dinner. Says if he doesn't do it, his brother's gonna get a beating. So, he takes the piglet, ties it up to a tree in the backyard. He wants to make it quick and painless. The thing is, by Jimmy not trying to hurt the pig, he ends up hurting him worse. Stabbed it in the belly, in the back, in the legs, until it just bled out. And that pig screamed all night long. All the neighbors heard it. No one ever fucked with Jimmy anymore,"
 Daryl tells Armand while taking inspiration from Jimmy and stabbing the other man non-fatally but painfully several times with a tool.

Armand finally gives in and admits that he doesn't know what Quinn wants with Laurent, but he does know that Quinn thinks that he can use the kid to get what he wants. Isabelle realizes that Quinn is using Laurent to get to her. Daryl realizes that while they can't go in through the front door, there must be another way in, and Isabelle asks Armand. Armand insists that it's impossible, so Daryl suggests that Isabelle leave so that she doesn't have to hear the man scream. However, Isabelle decides to stay and as Daryl moves to continue with his torture, the man finally reveals that there is a way, but it's very dangerous and Armand can draw them a map. After Isabelle translates for him, Daryl relents in his torture and tells her that they'll just take Armand with them instead of having Armand draw them a map.

In the cemetery, Daryl ties Armand to a stair railing and Isabelle guesses that "Jimmy" is actually Daryl himself. However, Daryl claims that he had just made everything up. Daryl, Isabelle, 
Sylvie
, 
Emile
, 
Fallou
, 
Bastien
 and 
Nadine
 gather to discuss their plan. Isabelle and Sylvie will go to Pont de la Tournelle where a man named 
Azlan
 from 
the Nest
 will be waiting for them with a boat. Fallou and his people will provide a distraction for Daryl's rescue mission, and Fallou declares that 
"a threat to one of us, is a threat to all of us. And so, we go into this fight as a unit. Working in defense of the 
Union of Hope
. Go in as one, come back as one."
 The group splits up and Sylvie and Emile admit that they're both very scared. Sylvie kisses Emile before heading off on her task. Isabelle approaches Daryl to tell him something, but Daryl tells her to tell him at the river after Laurent is rescued. Daryl leaves with Armand as Isabelle and Sylvie watch him go.

In the woods, Armand leads Daryl to an entrance hatch leading into the 
Catacombs of Paris
. Daryl hears a growling noise which Armand, much to Daryl's annoyance, reveals comes from walkers in the catacombs. The two men drop into the catacombs with Armand landing badly and he leads Daryl towards the Demimonde.

Outside of the main entrance, Fallou, Emile, Bastien, and Nadine launch a diversionary attack against the guards using rifles, Molotov cocktails and grenades, killing one man. As Daryl becomes distracted by the sound of walkers approaching, Armand elbows him in the face and takes off, trying to escape. However, Armand doesn't get far due to his stab wounds, and he falls, suffering a badly broken ankle, causing Daryl to call him an idiot. Armand begs for help and when Daryl asks where to go, Armand gives him directions. No longer needing Armand's help, Daryl quips 
"bon appetite"
 and leaves him to be devoured by the approaching herd. As the firefight continues, Emile suffers a non life-threatening gunshot wound to his left thigh, but he insists that they have to finish the job. With the guards getting closer, Fallou throws a final grenade while Bastien and Nadine throw a Molotov cocktail each before they finally retreat. Daryl enters the nightclub through a grating and hides behind the bar as reinforcements rush to help at the main gate before heading to find Laurent.

In Quinn's room, Laurent looks at the Eiffel Tower necklace that Anna had given to him, and she comments that the tower doesn't look like it used to. Laurent tells Anna that it will be beautiful again someday. Anna sympathetically tells Laurent that she hopes that he gets to go home soon, stating that she wants Laurent where he's the happiest. Laurent tells Anna that she's nice, but she doesn't want anyone to know that while Anna calls Laurent a good kid which everyone knows in return. Daryl enters and promises to take the boy to Isabelle, but when he turns to give Anna back her necklace, she's pointing the gun that Quinn gave to her at Daryl. After a moment, Anna lowers her gun and tells them to just go.

Quinn reaches the entrance and finds only his men and no sign of the attackers, and he instantly deduces that the attack was just a diversion. On the second floor catwalk, Quinn finds Daryl and Laurent and the two men engage in a fight that ends with Daryl nearly slitting his throat before he notices Laurent watching them. After a moment, Daryl chooses to just knock Quinn out instead and he and Laurent make their escape with Laurent briefly hesitating as he passes by Quinn.

Fallou and Emile join Isabelle and Sylvie at the river and, as Sylvie tends to Emile, Fallou reveals that Genet is posting guards at the city limits and soon there will be no way out. Daryl arrives with Laurent who reunites with Isabelle and Sylvie. However, Isabelle tells Daryl that with the Guerrier overtaking and locking down the city, she needs someone with influence to make sure that Laurent will be allowed to escape. Quinn knows how to make things happen and he'll do it for her if she stays. Isabelle rejects Daryl's offer to go with her, telling him that no one will make it out of Paris if she stays and she must do it alone. While this isn't Daryl's fight and he should be on his way home right now, there is no one else to take Laurent to the Nest safely with both Isabelle and Sylvie remaining behind in Paris. Isabelle promises to find a way out once she knows that Laurent is safe, and Daryl agrees to complete the journey to the Nest with Laurent himself.

Isabelle hopes that this won't be the last time that they meet each other, but if it is, she hopes that Daryl makes it home. Laurent asks when he will see her again, and Isabelle promises her nephew to do everything in her power to get back to him, asking Laurent to trust her. Laurent begs Isabelle to come with them, and she tearfully hugs him, promising that the boy will be safe with Daryl. As Daryl leads Laurent to the boat, Sylvie hugs him goodbye, calling Laurent her little brother and promising that they will meet again.

Daryl and Laurent board Azlan's boat and depart from Paris, passing the Eiffle Tower one last time on their way out as well as other Paris landmarks such as the Paris Statue of Liberty.



"
Deux Amours
"


Azlan's boat sails along a river and Laurent sits in the bow, enjoying the fresh air and praying. Watching Laurent, Daryl asks Azlan what the Nest is like, and Azlan calls it a special place and a home for the soul. Daryl is worried about Laurent's safety, noting that the nuns had raised the boy a little soft, but Azlan reassures him that Laurent "will be well looked after. Nurtured and groomed... to be the leader he's destined to be." Watching Laurent try to catch flies with his bare hands, Daryl isn't reassured by this. Azlan asks if Daryl is a Christian, but Daryl quips that he was kicked out of Sunday school. Azlan compares Daryl to how, in the Bible, Abraham became a pilgrim, but Daryl guesses that Abraham didn't end up in France which Azlan acknowledges. Azlan is curious as to how Daryl ended up in France, so far from home and Daryl watches Laurent thoughtfully.

In a flashback, Daryl pushes his motorcycle along a road when Jones drives up, offering help. Daryl rejects his offer, telling Jones that he's heading home, but Jones notes that Daryl's bike is out of fuel. Daryl asks if Jones has any to spare and Jones states that it depends and asks if Daryl is any good with his knives.

Jones drives Daryl to an auto repair shop where Daryl sees Dr. Lafleur communicating with someone on the radio in French and joins a group of men that are gathering. Juno asks T.J. about a picture of his girlfriend, before taking it from the young man and making a crass joke about her. Jones goes over the rules which includes no fighting, stealing, or sexual deviancy, and no children, elderly or anyone shorter than five foot four inches will be accepted. Dr. Lafleur refuses to explain why he needs the walkers and Jones states that all they to know is that they will receive one pint of ethanol per head. Juno is angry as they were offered a quart for each walker, but Dr. Lafleur promises a quart for each fresh walker that they bring in which satisfies Juno. As everyone collects their supplies, T.J. tries to find anyone willing to team up with him, but no one's interested.

In the present, Azlan tells Daryl that he's sure however Daryl got to France, it was hard, but Azlan fears that Daryl's journey home may be even harder. Daryl asks how much further to the Nest, and Azlan reveals that it's about 200 kilometers or about 124 miles away, pleasing Daryl.

In a flashback, Daryl attracts walkers to him in the woods and shoots through one and into another with an arrow from his crossbow that has a cable attached to it. Daryl ties to the two to a tree and drives a stake that he had been sharpening through the sides of one's mouth.

At the auto repair shop, Juno, Drew and Grady lead a line of five chained-up walkers into shipping containers. Juno reports on their progress to Dr. Lafleur, including that one of the walkers can't have been more than a few months turned. Much to the amazement of the gathered hunters, Daryl arrives leading a long line of captured walkers, each with a stake through their mouths so that they can't bite anyone. An impressed Jones gives Daryl a gas can to collect his payment with and Daryl promises that he'll do even better the next day. Having been unsuccessful in his own hunt, T.J. tries to get some advice from Daryl as Bert and a woman fills up the can for him, but Daryl tells T.J. to go home to his girlfriend. However, T.J. tells him that he can't really go back empty handed and asks to partner with Daryl who is uninterested.

In the present, Laurent fishes off of the back of Azlan's boat as Daryl and Azlan tie it to a tree on shore. After retrieving some old cans from a nearby structure to act as a warning system against walkers, Azlan checks an old pocket watch and explains that it's almost time for prayer for him. Laurent brings Daryl a fish that he caught, and Daryl offers to show the boy how to gut the fish. Laurent refuses as he had made a promise to God not to eat animals, but Azlan backs Daryl up that it's alright. Daryl tells Laurent that he needs to learn how to take care of himself and Laurent admits that he misses Isabelle and asks about Daryl's friends that he misses. Daryl lists Judith, R.J., Connie, Ezekiel and Carol, but brushes off further conversation and kills the fish. Laurent tells Daryl to not worry as they will all be together again.

Daryl attempts to teach Laurent how to put a fish on a sharpened stick, but the boy is more interested in watching Azlan pray, noting that he has read the Quaran and finds it interesting that there are many different names, but only one God. Daryl admits that he doesn't pray to anyone and instead believes in pulling your own weight. Laurent refuses to try what Daryl showed him, but Daryl tells the boy that sometimes you don't have a choice but to do things that you don't want to do, and he finally agrees.

At night, Laurent prays, asking for God to look over Daryl's friends because Daryl doesn't know how to pray and asking for God to let him be strong like Daryl is strong. Azlan explains that his pocket watch saved his life and Daryl asks about Le Havre, but Azlan reveals that Genet controls the port in Le Havre. However, Azlan promises Daryl that the Union of Hope's leader Losang will help him to secure a boat home. Azlan is interested in Daryl, calling him a lone wolf who only wants to get back to his pack. Daryl explains that he had made a promise, but Azlan tells him that sometimes even a man's promise can get overwhelmed by a connection to other people or a larger cause. Daryl notes that when a man dies in someone else's war, it's his kids that suffer and it gets passed down to their kids and eventually, no one even remembers what the underlying cause that everyone was fighting for was. Daryl admits that causes were never really his thing. "When I first got to the Nest, I had just lost my wife and son. All I wanted to do was die. Losang asked me to fix this watch, told me how important it was. I worked on it, day and night, for months. And when I finally got it running, he told me it didn't matter anymore. Because I had found a reason to live," Azlan explains. Thinking on Azlan's words, Daryl watches Laurent as he finishes up his prayers.

In a flashback, Daryl fuels up his bike as T.J. approaches Juno and his friends, attempting more desperately to get the men to allow him to work with them. After making fun of T.J., Juno asks him to chop some more firewood and to keep the fire going for the rest of the night while they rest, and Juno will consider letting him come along. T.J. struggles to do it properly, so a sympathetic Daryl shows him what to do. T.J. explains that he's from just outside of Freeport, Maine which is just a couple of miles up the road, but his girlfriend's father practically keeps her prisoner. T.J. had promised to take her far away, so he can't go back without any fuel. T.J. has heard that it's better in California or at least better than this, but Daryl warns him not to believe everything that he hears. Seeing a man heading over to the radio, Daryl goes inside to talk to him, leaving the young man to continue chopping firewood.

Daryl lays awake at night and has a flashback to when he tried to use Jones' radio to contact Carol at the Commonwealth. The radio operator hopes that Carol is found quickly as the connection usually only lasts for a few minutes and they've been at this for awhile. Just as Daryl is about to give up, Carol finally comes on the line, surprised to hear from her friend. Daryl reassures Carol that he's okay, and explains that since he has access to a radio, he thought that he'd try to reach out to her. Daryl tells Carol that he's in Maine by the coast and he asks if everything is good back home. Carol tells him that everything is pretty quiet which takes some getting used to, but Daryl expresses concern about if Carol is really alright. Carol promises her friend that he never has to worry about her, and asks how it is out there. Daryl promises to tell Carol when he sees her, revealing that he's just gathering some fuel and he will be home in about a week. As the transmission breaks up, Carol tells Daryl that someone came back, but Daryl is unable to hear the name of the person who came back over the static and he loses contact with Carol.

In the present, Daryl hears clattering and walker growls before a walker approaches the shelter where Daryl and Laurent are sleeping. Daryl stabs the walker in the head, and he orders Laurent, who was awakened by the commotion, to stay there. Outside, Daryl finds the body of another walker and a burner as well as Azlan up against a telephone pole. Daryl reassures the other man that he took care of the walker who got away from him and Azlan explains that he had slipped fighting the walkers off. Examining Azlan, who is paralyzed, Daryl finds a spike impaling him in the upper back, mortally wounding the other man. Azlan ruefully notes that after years of training, he's done in by a telephone pole which Daryl sadly notes is a tough break. With a laugh, Azlan tells Daryl that at least they know that God has a sense of humor since Azlan's father had worked for the phone company his whole life. Azlan tells Daryl to get Laurent to the Nest and hands Daryl his pocket watch which has a picture of Mont-Saint-Michel on the inside cover. Azlan instructs Daryl to follow the river to Mont-Saint-Michel which is the Nest and to beware of telephone poles. Azlan reassures Daryl that he's at peace since he knows that the boy is in good hands with Daryl and he's facing east. Azlan gives Daryl his own knife to put Azlan down with before he can reanimate and, with a final prayer, Azlan dies.

The next morning, Daryl finishes burying his friend and Laurent lays some rosary beads on his grave. However, when they go to leave, Azlan's boat is gone, and the rope has been cut. Daryl realizes that Laurent is responsible, tossing the boy's knife into the river and furiously yelling at Laurent, calling him worthless and telling the boy that he should've left Laurent right where he found him. Daryl demands to know why he did this, and Laurent tearfully explains that he's lost everyone that he cares about and when they get to the Nest, he'll lose Daryl too and Laurent doesn't want to be alone. Becoming emotional too, Daryl apologizes for his actions and hugs Laurent before the two resume their journey on foot.

As they continue on their journey, Daryl tries to reassure Laurent that there's probably going to be a bunch of good people at the Nest, pointing out that Azlan was from the Nest, and he was nice. While Daryl told Isabelle that he'd drop Laurent off at the Nest and she come looking for her nephew there, Laurent wants to go with Daryl instead. Laurent insists that he can help Daryl and promises to listen to him and to only have to be shown things once, but Daryl tells him that it's not about that. The two are forced to hide as Guerriers approach, but Laurent accidentally drops some of his stuff out of his bag on the road.

In a flashback, Daryl packs up as Juno returns with more walkers, including a zombified T.J. Daryl confronts Juno who claims that they had just found T.J. like that, but Daryl notes the rope burns around T.J.'s neck and realizes that Juno had murdered him. A remorseless Juno tells Daryl that "a quart's a quart, you prick. You know, you snooze, you lose," having murdered T.J. for the promised quart of ethanol that he would get for bringing in a fresh walker. Daryl furiously attacks Juno and has to be restrained and the two men are led away for breaking the rules against fighting.

In the present, Daryl instructs Laurent to follow the river until he finds the place on the watch and gives the boy his knife for protection, promising that he'll be right behind him. Daryl orders the reluctant Laurent to go as the Guerriers find the boy's belongings and spread out to search for him. Daryl tries to sneak up on one with his morning star, but the man hears him coming and captures Daryl. The men report to Capo that there's no sign of the boy who questions Daryl through one of his men who speaks English where Laurent is. Capo threatens to remove Daryl's eyes if he doesn't talk, but Daryl defiantly refuses to tell him anything. As the Guerrier prepares to cut out Daryl's left eye, Laurent gives himself up in order to save his friend.

Quinn presents Isabelle with an expensive necklace, and she wonders if he stole it. Quinn notes Isabelle's own past as an accomplished thief and reveals that he'd gotten it for her 12 years ago, although Quinn didn't think that it would take so long for him to give it to her. Quinn has to go out for awhile, but he will be back, having been invited by Genet to a gathering at Maison Mère. Genet is calling it De Gaulle Day and she needs people like Quinn who can get their hands on things. Isabelle claims that she's been thinking about what he said about going back to the way that things used to be, but you can't move forward if you're looking back. Putting on the necklace, Isabelle tells a pleased Quinn "let's start over."

Isabelle and Quinn arrive at Maison Mère where numerous people are gathering for Genet's celebration. In the crowd, Isabelle notices Emile, Sylvie and Fallou who discreetly nod at her as Isabelle passes by her friends. Guerriers lead Quinn and Isabelle to Genet as a man is dragged into a cell and beaten to death by two other Guerriers. Quinn introduces Isabelle to Genet who explains that the man was one of her Guerriers charged with securing the city, but he accepted a bribe to let out people that the Power of the Living had wanted to keep in. Genet leads them to a cell area where Anna and Stéphane are waiting and Daryl is locked up, revealing that Anna had betrayed them to Genet. Quinn warns Anna that she's got no idea what she's done, but Anna just kisses him on the cheek and leaves without a word. Genet locks Quinn in with Daryl and leads Isabelle away as Daryl apologizes to her.

In their cell, Quinn tells Daryl that he held up his end of things and if Daryl had done his part, none of this would be happening. Furious, Quinn warns Daryl that he'd best sleep with one eye open.

In a flashback, at night Daryl and Juno are led onto the Power of the Living ship where Daryl notices some of the crew securing a rowboat and a lab in a shipping container with a walker head in a tank and a walker chained to the wall as well as cages full of walkers with two on the upper level and the two on the lower level marked with signs reading Fast and Feed respectively. The crew lock Daryl and Juno in a shipping container that has several other prisoners with one crewmember removing Daryl's wing vest from him. Juno protests that they should fight this as he believes that they will die otherwise, but Daryl allows himself to be locked up. Juno angrily demands answers from the crew about where they're going, but they just ignore him. Later, as the ship crosses the Atlantic Ocean, three crewmembers violently beat one of the prisoners before removing him and tossing the man into the walker cage marked Feed to be devoured, much to the shock and horror of Daryl and Juno.

In the present, Guerriers take Daryl from his cell while Genet leads Laurent and Isabelle into the gallery of a fighting pit, telling the boy that there will be a few words and a show, but it won't last long and then Laurent will come out and meet everyone. Genet makes a speech before the gathered crowd who sing an anthem during part of it: "Welcome brave friends. Brave, because you have ventured out. From Saint Denis to the Rive Gauche, Montmartre to la Chapelle. Today we celebrate our rebirth and the rise of the 6th Republic. Today, and ever after we will be free, and strong, and unafraid! We have all felt lost at times, far from the life we knew. Deprived of the people we loved. In a hopeless world, it would have been so easy to give up. But we did not give up. In the name of all those we loved. In the name of all those we lost. As we must continue to do... Not for ourselves. But for the future. Years from now, you will tell your grandchildren that you were here. Now. The day we ushered in a new France! A France free of the tyranny of the elite, that welcomes in all friends. With hope for a future... Because, yes, the world is simple now, there are friends. And there are enemies. The enemies want to go back to the way things were, when the few controlled the many. They took everything, bringing pain and suffering down on those who could least bear it, profiting all the while. Finally, out of greed and hubris, they unleashed this plague on the world. They made up pay for being poor, vulnerable, meek. But remember what the Bible says about the meek. We're not meek anymore! The world is ours, now. So today, we will make our enemies pay! We have all felt the anguish. We have all suffered loss. Loss blinds us! Loss gives us power! They gave us this disease! But I want you to see today the power our future holds. Because their disease can also be our cure. Power to the living!"

In a flashback, Daryl and Juno are now alone in the container, the other prisoners having been fed to the walkers. Daryl coughs up blood as Juno frantically bangs on the container door, yelling at the crew that Daryl is puking blood, and he will turn if he dies in there. After viciously kicking Daryl, three crewmembers drag him out and to the walker cage. Having faked his injury, Daryl suddenly fights back, throwing one man to the walkers, shooting another with his own rifle and strangling the last one with the rifle strap so hard that his neck eventually snaps. Recovering his wing vest, Daryl unleashes the caged walkers on the upper level who fall upon the four crewmembers chasing Daryl, devouring one as the others open fire, while Daryl releases Juno who is amazed that Daryl's plan had worked.

As the crew fights off the walkers, Daryl and Juno make their way to the rowboat which they begin preparing for their escape. The three surviving crewmembers get swarmed and eaten by walkers with one falling into the lab as a walker grabs him. causing a fire. Juno struggles to understand the instructions for the controls, but the chained-up walker breaks free, knocks aside other walkers and charges up the stairs, violently ripping apart and devouring Juno who hits a button as he falls, releasing the rowboat into the water below. The walker turns on Daryl, revealing that it has black eyes like the walker that Dr. Lafleur had been experimenting upon. Grabbing a Fire Extinguisher, Daryl bashes the walker hard in the head, but it gets back up rather than staying down. As the walker charges him and the lab explodes, Daryl jumps overboard.

In the present, Daryl is led into the fighting pit during Genet's speech and untied. Seeing Daryl, Isabelle and Laurent exchange concerned looks. As the crowd chants Pouvoir at the end of Genet's speech, a man tosses an axe at Daryl's feet and a walker is led into the pit. A Guerrier shoots the walker in the neck with a dart which causes the walker to mutate, developing black eyes and the veins of a burner. The crowd cheers, a horrified Isabelle tells Laurent not to look and Stéphane yells at Daryl that he dies today for his brother. Daryl raises his axe as the walker breaks free of its restraints and charges at him.



"
Coming Home
"


In a flashback on 
Omaha Beach
 during D-Day, a number of soldiers lie dead in the mud, including 
William Dixon
. In the background, William's comrades call for him.

In the present, the walker test subject mutates into a hybrid 
variant
 while 
Stéphane Codron
 yells at 
Daryl
 that he's going to die today for Stéphane's 
brother
. Daryl dodges the hybrid's first charge, sending it into the wall, and knocks its feet out from under it with his axe when it charges the second time, but the hybrid gets back up both times. The third time it charges, Daryl impales it with his axe and traps it against a pillar, but he is forced to let go as the hybrid's acidic blood burns his hands. 
Genet
 is pleased with these events while 
Isabelle
 prays for Daryl while she holds 
Laurent
. Laurent reassures his aunt that Daryl will win, having confidence in his friend's skills. The hybrid is able to pull itself off the axe and charges Daryl again who grabs a French flag while dodging the hybrid's attacks. Using the flag as a makeshift 
spear
, Daryl impales the hybrid mid-charge, flips it to the ground and finally finishes it off by planting the flagpole in the hybrid variant's head.

Genet is furious at Daryl's victory while a pleased Laurent tells Isabelle that he was right that Daryl could it. 
Dr. Lafleur
 reassures Genet that that's not the best that he has, just the first. Men enter and remove the corpse and the axe, placing the flag back where it belongs before a shackled 
Quinn
 is led in. The two men are shackled together at the wrist with a chain of a few feet between them and a new axe and a weapon for Quinn are brought in. The two men initially believe that they are being pitted in a battle to the death against each other before the lights go out for a moment and, when they come back on, spotlights illuminate four chained walkers around the fighting pit and Laurent begins desperately praying for Daryl's safety. Genet orders Dr. Lafleur to give the 
Power of the Living
 crowd a show and, on his signal, all four walkers are darted with his mutation solution. However, while three successfully mutate into hybrid variants, the head of the fourth explodes, just like 
one of the doctor's previous experiments
. In the gallery, 
Fallou
 orders 
Sylvie
 and 
Emile
 to go around while Fallou stays in his current position and Isabelle notices her friends moving through the crowd.

Daryl orders Quinn to follow his lead as one of the hybrids breaks free only, much to the shock of everyone, another hybrid to rush in and rip apart its head. Dr. Lafleur nervously reassures an increasingly angry Genet that there are still two left. The final hybrid breaks free and charges, but Daryl and Quinn use their chain to clothesline it to the ground and do the exact same thing to the second hybrid as it breaks away from the one that it had killed and attacks as well. Daryl 
chops off
 the leg of one of the hybrids, but their attempts to take out the other one are deflected by the metal headband that it's still wearing. Daryl's efforts to finish off the downed hybrid are interrupted by Quinn's fight with the one that's still standing and the chain that's connecting the two men and giving them a limited reach from each other. The hybrid tackles Daryl to the ground and he uses his chain in its mouth to hold it at bay as Quinn tries unsuccessfully to strike its brain with his weapon. The other hybrid drags Quinn away, inadvertently pulling both Daryl and the hybrid that he was fighting along by the chain. Knocking the hybrid off of him, Quinn manages to bash its head in which is unprotected, unlike the other hybrid. As the surviving hybrid attempts to kill Quinn, Daryl wraps the chain around its neck and, working together, the two men use the chain to 
decapitate
 it, winning the fight.

Excited by the victory, the crowd turns from chanting 
"Pouvoir"
 to chanting 
"Dixon,"
 cheering Daryl on. Furious, Genet reminds Dr. Lafleur that the whole point of the fight was to win these people over their cause, and he admits that there's still some work to be done. Holding the zombified head up to the cheering crowd, Daryl tosses it at Genet, landing near the feet of her chair, although Genet quickly moves out of the way of any danger. As men enter the pit to remove the bodies, Genet orders 
Capo
 to get this over with. Capo signals one of his men to kill Daryl and Quinn, but Fallou shoots him in the head before the Guerrier can open fire. The crowd panics and flees while Genet, Isabelle and Laurent are escorted out by the Guerriers. Seeing that the fleeing men in the pit had left the door open, Daryl and Quinn grab their weapons and make their escape.

A furious Genet orders Capo to find out how many of the 
Union of Hope
 people there are, how they got in, and how they got weapons past the guards. Genet asserts her authority over Capo, warning the man that she's the one giving the orders while he's the one following them. If Capo can't, she'll give the orders to someone who can. After confirming that Daryl killed Stéphane's brother, Genet orders Capo to find and kill Daryl and to take Stéphane with him as he's motivated to kill Daryl. 
"You want your 
revenge
? Go get it,"
 Genet orders him. Hiding from searching Guerriers, Daryl notices a wound in the back of Quinn's left shoulder which Quinn insists is just a burn from the hybrid and he's fine and doesn't even feel it, but Daryl is unconvinced.

Running through the halls, a weakening Quinn is forced to stop due to his wound. Daryl refuses to die here, but Quinn asks what it matters when you have to die somewhere. Daryl attempts to break the chain without success and a 
remorseful
 Quinn admits that he was terrible to Isabelle and that his attempts to get it right the next time only made things worse. Daryl calls Quinn out on 
using his own kid to get her back
, and Quinn admits that he didn't see it like that. Quinn thinks that it's too late to matter now, but Daryl, recognizing Quinn's genuine remorse and that Quinn doesn't have much time left, suggests that it doesn't have to be, that Quinn could buy him some time and help to save both Isabelle and Laurent. Agreeing, Quinn tells Daryl to cut his hand off at the wrist so as to free them from each other. Daryl promises to tell Isabelle what Quinn did for her and, after making a torniquet with Quinn's belt, cuts off Quinn's hand with his axe. Rounding the corner, the two men encounter three Guerriers who had heard Quinn's cries. As Daryl escapes, Quinn attacks the Guerriers, killing all of them.

Isabelle and Laurent sneak through 
Maison Mère
, avoiding the searching Guerriers. Outside, Daryl recovers his 
knife
 and 
morning star
 from the backseat of the jeep that had transported him to Maison Mère. Following gurgling sounds, Daryl finds a Guerrier with a slit throat choking to death on his own blood in a nearby garage and, much to his relief, Fallou, Sylvie and Emile hiding inside. Daryl guesses that Isabelle and Laurent are in one of the cellblocks which he knows how to find and asks Fallou, who reveals that his uncle ran a garage, to get one of the trucks running. Using some of the tools in the garage, Emile breaks the shackle off of Daryl's wrist.

Making their way through the tunnels, Daryl, Isabelle and Laurent find each other, with Daryl separated from the others by a locked gate. Daryl instructs Isabelle to get a pipe to break the lock, but a zombified Quinn enters and charges at Isabelle who hits him in the head with the pipe. Recovering from the blow, Quinn attacks Isabelle who struggles to keep him off of her. A zombified Guerrier enters the tunnel, but Daryl draws him over to the gate and stabs him in the head with his axe. Unable to help Isabelle himself, Daryl hands Laurent the axe and tells him to use it to save Isabelle. The frightened boy approaches Isabelle and Quinn while Daryl yells encouragement at him to save Isabelle. When Laurent continues to hesitate, Daryl reassures him that 
"God'll forgive you."
 With a yell, Laurent axes Quinn in the head, putting him down and saving Isabelle's life.

Having escaped from Maison Mère, Laurent sits in the back of the 
group
's stolen truck looking at 
Azlan
's pocket watch while Emile tells Sylvie that he and Fallou must go where they are most needed, and he hopes that she will join them one day. Emile and Sylvie kiss while Laurent reassures Fallou that they know where the Nest is. Fallou wishes them good luck and he leaves with Emile who briefly stops to exchange one last smile with Sylvie. Daryl hangs the pocket watch on the rearview mirror and the group - reunited at last - drives off to finish their long journey to the Nest. Daryl tries to reassure a worried Sylvie that Fallou won't let anything happen to Emile, but he doesn't respond to her question if Daryl has ever been in love. Isabelle tells Laurent that she's always protected him, but this time he protected her, and Isabelle is sorry that Laurent had to do that. Laurent tells Isabelle that it wasn't Quinn anymore and he was never Laurent's father. 
"Sometimes you have to do horrible things, and no matter how bad you feel, if there is no other choice, God will forgive you. Like with my 
mother
."
 The truck suddenly begins experiencing engine trouble, forcing Daryl to pull over and check it out.

As Daryl works on the truck, Sylvie and Laurent sleep in the back and Isabelle stands outside with him. Isabelle tells Daryl that her father had once tried to teach her how to change a tire, but he gave up after two hours. Daryl reveals that 
his father
 used to have Daryl and 
Merle
 take apart engines and if they couldn't put them back together, they got no dinner. Daryl admits that it was hard when his father was around which was hardly ever. Daryl's father grew up without a father too and he guesses that history repeats itself if you're not careful. Daryl's grandfather had died in France during World War II, enlisting, leaving his 
pregnant
 wife back home, and never came back while his family fell apart back home. Daryl thinks that it hardly seems worth it as his grandfather didn't put up much of a fight for what he believed in, never even making it off of the beach.

Isabelle notes that Laurent has changed greatly since he first met Daryl, but Daryl denies having much to do with it, telling Isabelle that kids grow up. Isabelle states that Laurent has never had a fatherly influence in his life, although she guesses that growing up with no father was better than growing up with Quinn. Daryl reveals that Quinn had thought of Isabelle before he died, and Isabelle reveals that she was afraid of Daryl at first as there's something in his eyes and Isabelle could tell that Daryl's been through stuff. With his scars, Isabelle could tell that Daryl was dangerous and that he could get them where they needed to go. Laughing, Daryl says that he's glad that he could help. As Daryl begins working under the truck, Isabelle confesses that she had lied to him about 
the picture of Daryl on the beach
. Rather than it having been drawn weeks before like Isabelle had claimed, she had Laurent draw it when Daryl first got to the 
abbey
 in the hopes that it would help convince Daryl to help them. While Isabelle calls her actions stupid, Daryl suggests that it wasn't as he's here now and it's not because of that picture.

When Isabelle doesn't respond to his request for a big wrench, Daryl emerges from under the truck to find Stéphane holding it and he hits Daryl in the face with the wrench and throws him onto the ground next to the truck where Capo and three other Guerriers gather up Isabelle, Sylvie and Laurent. Daryl pleads with Stéphane to not do this, promising to go with him, but Capo tells Daryl that Genet has ordered for them all to die today, Laurent first. When Isabelle tries to resist, a Guerrier stabs her in the right shoulder and Capo hands Stéphane his gun, telling Stéphane to do it for his brother, letting the death of his friends be the last thing that Daryl sees. Daryl pleads with a visibly conflicted Stéphane to not go through with it as Stéphane takes aim at Laurent and Capo orders him to hurry up. Laurent tells Stéphane that God loves him, and Stéphane suddenly shoots Capo and the three Guerriers dead instead. Stéphane takes aim at Daryl as he, Sylvie and Laurent hover protectively over Isabelle, but lowers his gun after a moment, deciding to let Daryl go and get his revenge the next time. Picking up Azlan's pocket watch, Stéphane recognizes the picture of 
Mont-Saint-Michel
 inside and deduces that it's the Nest. Stéphane tells the group that it's not even a day's walk north and he instructs them to burn the truck as it makes them too easy to track. That night, the group watches the truck burn before setting out on the final leg of their journey, Daryl supporting the injured Isabelle.

The next day, the group finds and crosses the tide lands leading to Mont-Saint-Michel and finally reaches the Nest where the inhabitants joyfully greet them. 
Losang
 welcomes Laurent to the Nest and orders his people to get Isabelle to the infirmary quickly, reassuring Laurent that the Nest has good doctors, and they will do everything that they can for her. After Laurent reveals that Daryl doesn't speak French, Losang greets Daryl in perfect unaccented English, revealing much to Daryl's surprise that Losang is American too. Losang explains that he's originally from Hoboken, New Jersey and he came to 
Paris
 as a student in the 90's, something that Azlan didn't mention. Daryl reveals that Azlan didn't make it and Losang sadly tells Daryl that Azlan will be missed, and he was a good man, devoted and kind. Daryl warns Losang that Genet will be coming for them, and Losang promises that while they will pray that she won't, the Union will be ready if the day ever comes that she does.

Isabelle awakens in the infirmary some time later and finds Daryl teaching a class on using guns while Laurent enjoys playing soccer with other children. Laurent hugs his aunt while Daryl gives her a wave while continuing with his class. As time passes, Losang and Laurent walk with each other discuss philosophy, everyone enjoys dinner together, Isabelle and Sylvie watch Daryl playing with Laurent and Daryl watches Isabelle listening to a lecture by Losang. After finding Isabelle cleaning her wound, Daryl helps her clean it at her request. Daryl admits that the Nest isn't what he had expected, having expected to find a bunch of Amish people running around. Isabelle likes it at the Nest which feels like home to her, and Daryl admits that it kind of grows on you.

Walking with Daryl, Losang admits that he had been skeptical when 
Père Jean
 had first sent word of Laurent, but Losang decided to do the pilgrim's Camino to Santiago, so he stopped at the abbey to meet him, and he knew that Père Jean was right. Daryl calls Laurent a good kid, one who Losang says looks up to Daryl and is here because of him, although Daryl deflects that it was thanks to Isabelle really. Losang is grateful to the both of them and sorry to see Daryl go, surprising Daryl. Losang explains that Daryl kept his word and the Union kept theirs: they've found a vessel to help get Daryl home. Fishermen from Dover will give Daryl safe passage to England, and they know of boats that can get him as far as Newfoundland, although Daryl will have to figure out the rest on his own. The boat will be there in two days and Daryl will have to walk to the north coast, so Losang suggests that he set out at dawn unless he's changed his mind.

A conflicted Daryl tells Losang that he's got people waiting for him 
back home
, but Losang points out that Daryl has people who hope that he will stay in France. Watching Isabelle and Laurent through a window, Daryl admits that it's not so easy and Losang acknowledges that they don't know what tomorrow will bring and Daryl needs to go an ocean away with the world being what it is while Losang and his people need Daryl too here and now. While the Power of the Living isn't Daryl's fight, Losang suggests that Isabelle and Laurent are the reason that he's torn, stating that 
"sometimes, when a person leaves home, he comes to find he belongs someplace else."


At the Nest, Daryl packs up and Isabelle confronts him about leaving without even saying goodbye. Daryl tells her that he made a promise to his friends back home, just like he did to Isabelle. Daryl kept his promise to Isabelle which she appreciates, but Daryl also told her that he had 
left the Commonwealth
 to see what was out in the world and Isabelle thinks that he found something, even if it wasn't what Daryl was looking for. Daryl reminds Isabelle that this has always been his intention ever since he first washed ashore in France, and Isabelle asks about Laurent, wondering if Daryl is going to leave without saying goodbye and abandon the boy, comparing it to Daryl's father abandoning him. Daryl insists that it's not the same, but Isabelle thinks that Daryl cares about Laurent and it scares him. Daryl thinks that he's escaping history by doing this, but he's only repeating it by abandoning the boy who has become as good as Daryl's own son over their time together. Daryl tells Isabelle that he respects her for believing what she believes and while the Nest feels like home to her and he truly hopes that it is for both Isabelle and Laurent, Daryl has his own home to get back to. Upset, Isabelle tells Daryl that she's glad that they met, and she wishes him Godspeed on his journey and leaves. Daryl visits the sleeping Laurent and after hesitating for a moment, leaves the boy with the Rubik's Cube that Laurent had given to Daryl when they first met and leaves.

Daryl sets out on his journey north, pausing for a moment to look back at Mont-Saint-Michel, sheltering in abandoned building for the night during a 
thunderstorm
 and passing a walker trapped in a tree. Near Omaha Beach, Daryl finds a tattered American flag overlooking 
an old cemetery
 for American soldiers who died in France during World War II. Searching through it, Daryl finds the grave of Private William T. Dixon, his grandfather, and cries. In the distance, Daryl spots the beach and the boat offshore that's waiting for him. After pausing to look at his grandfather's grave, Daryl heads for the beach.

Daryl waves at the boat which signals back at him with a light. Drawn by the noise, a 
herd
 of lurkers emerge from where they were lying in the grass around the area and Daryl fights his way through them with his morning star and knife to the beach. As Daryl makes his way across the beach, Laurent calls out to him from the top of a nearby structure, having secretly followed Daryl all the way from the Nest. Pausing as the herd closes in on the boy, Daryl looks back and forth between the boat, torn between going home and Laurent.

"
La Gentillesse Des Étrangers
"


On a beach, five walkers approach 
Laurent
 who manages to take out two of them before falling over and calling for help. Suddenly, the walkers are yanked back by Daryl using a contraption that he has them attached to. Daryl and Laurent are on a beach near 
the Nest
 where Daryl has been teaching the boy how to fight the undead. Daryl puts down the remaining walkers with a 
spear
 and chides Laurent that he could've gotten one more, but Laurent states that he had lost his footing. Daryl explains that it had happened because Laurent backed up, and you must never back up. Laurent is sure that he'll never be as good as Daryl, but Daryl reminds him that only two weeks have passed.

Laurent tells Daryl that 
Père Jean
 had believed that walkers still had souls, and Daryl recognizes that his young friend recognizes his old mentor. Laurent admits it, but he likes it here at the Nest and 
"home is wherever the people you love are"
 which is what the kids had told him back 
when
 
Daryl's group
 had stayed at the 
elementary school
. 
Gilbert
 runs up, yelling that the boy is late for his philosophy lesson. Laurent is reluctant to go, but Gilbert tells him that 
Losang
 insists and that Daryl should head back as well because Losang would like to speak with Daryl.

In a meeting, Losang reveals that they have received a troubling report from 
Paris
. The 
Union of Hope
 
camp
 there, which was being rebuilt, was raided by the 
Power of the Living
 and three of their people were captured. 
Jacinta
 lists them as 
Martin Fournier
, 
Fallou Boukar
 and 
Emile Thibault
, causing 
Sylvie
 distress due to her romantic relationship with Emile. Sylvie tells Losang that Emile is her friend, and 
Isabelle
 explains that Emile and Fallou had helped Daryl's group to get out of Paris. Jacinta realizes that 
Genet
 will use them in the hopes of locating the Nest, but Isabelle doesn't think that they know the Nest's precise location. Jacinta points out that they can't be certain and 
Mathis
 tells Losang that he hopes to have a report from his scouts soon.

Sylvie argues that they have to save their people which Losang promises to do, but he advises patience. However, Daryl tells everyone that patience won't work because Genet will just kill their people if she can't get anything from them. Seeing how dour the mood is, Losang promises that they will do everything that they can with caution and dismisses the meeting, asking for Daryl to stay behind. Losang recognizes that Daryl thinks that it's a mistake not sending a team in right away, and Daryl points out that Genet's ruthless, meaning that if Losang waits, their people will die. However, Losang counters that if he acts impulsively, then they will all die, so he has to act prudently for the greater good. Sometimes that means resisting the urge to go on the offensive. Daryl argues that 
"sometimes you gotta be willing to throw the first punch,"
 but Losang prefers to throw the last one instead. Losang shows Daryl a 
thangka
, a Buddhist way of recording and teaching. It takes many years for the work to be acceptable, and Losang is still only a beginner.

Losang asks how long Daryl intends to stay at the Nest, but Daryl doesn't know and asks Losang how long it will take him to find Daryl another ride home. Losang admits that it could take a bit, and Daryl states that he'll stay until then. Losang knows that Daryl has been training Laurent to defend himself, but feels that it has become a distraction as Laurent is meant for much more. Losang confirms that what Laurent is meant for is more than just staying alive and he is worried about the impact that repeated violence will have on the boy and his ability to maintain empathy. Everyone at the Nest has a place if they choose to seek it out, and Losang hopes that Daryl will find his there too. Daryl leaves the room without another word.

Outside, Daryl tells Isabelle that Losang wants him to stop training Laurent and that he says that Daryl is too violent. However, Isabelle thinks that Daryl simply does what's necessary, even when no one else is willing to do it, 
"especially then, in fact."
 Isabelle suggests that what Losang means is that now that they've made it to the Nest, Laurent needs something else from him. Daryl isn't sure if the Nest is the place that he's supposed to be and Daryl isn't sure if he could be happy here while Isabelle thinks that she could be. Daryl can't stop think about all of the people that he had left behind in America and he wonders if they're still thinking about him.

Later, Losang practices fighting with 
staffs
 with two other people. Daryl enters, having heard that Mathis got word back which Losang confirms, telling Daryl that Genet is transporting her prisoners from 
Maison Mère
 to another facility in a few days and Mathis' team will intercept the transport. Daryl wants to go with them, but Losang tells him that the Union of Hope is a pacifist movement, and they resist violence when they can. Daryl states that he resists violence too when he can and Losang shows Daryl his staff which they use as a training for Aikido. Losang isn't using it as a weapon, he's using it to prepare in case he might need a weapon when he wants to punch back. Losang agrees to let Daryl go, telling him to bring their people back safely. Losang offers to go a round with Daryl, but Daryl is uninterested in fighting him with 
"that toothpick."


In a 
deserted town
, Daryl, Mathis and their team set up for the ambush. Mathis tells Daryl that the convoy will arrive shortly, and the first truck will trigger the explosion which will be just big enough to blow out their front tires. 
Alodie
 and 
Winston
 will keep the first vehicle busy while Daryl and Mathis go to the transport truck which is where their people will be. They will get in and get out as one.

Genet's convoy passes through the town, but avoids hitting the trap. Although Mathis calls for them to abort, Daryl emerges and shoots Genet's driver, causing her jeep to crash. A Guerrier emerges from the transport truck and shoots one of the team members before being killed by the team's sniper. Daryl kills two more Guerrieres while Mathis shoots the two in the final vehicle.

Daryl and the team help the rescued prisoners out of the transport truck and Fallou thanks Daryl. Emerging from the wreckage of her vehicle, the injured Genet laughs as she recognizes Daryl, commenting that she should've known because 
"angels always send their most vicious demon to do the dirty work. And here you are."
 Daryl reloads and prepares to kill Genet who simply stands there with her arms outstretched. However, the explosive suddenly detonates, distracting Daryl, and when he turns back, Genet is gone, having escaped.



"
Moulin Rouge
"


Bells toll as the rescue team triumphantly returns with 
Martin Fournier
, 
Emile Thibault
, and 
Fallou Boukar
. 
Sylvie
 embraces her boyfriend who is visibly haunted by his experiences as a prisoner of the 
Power of the Living
. 
Laurent
 hugs Daryl and gives him a figurine of a dog that Laurent had carved for his friend. 
Losang
 greets Daryl as everyone heads inside of the Nest.

As Laurent finishes his prayers, Losang asks the boy if he hopes for Daryl to stay at the Nest which Laurent confirms, but he thinks that Daryl misses 
Carol
 and his other friends and vice versa. Losang acknowledges that Daryl is a good man, but Laurent's future requires more than good aim with a weapon which is why Laurent is here with them. Losang knows that the boy isn't sure about all of it, but that's ok because 
"doubt is the question that faith answers. You doubt because you are special, not because you aren't."
 Laurent is clearly anxious to leave, admitting that Daryl wants to teach him something and that it's a surprise. Despite being visibly unhappy, Losang allows the boy to leave.

Once Laurent is gone, Jacinta warns him that Daryl will leave again, and she asks what will happen if Laurent wants to go with him. Losang believes that Daryl will eventually come around and that some people just need time. However, Jacinta warns him that they don't have time because even among the faithful, there are doubters and they've grown tired of waiting for deliverance. Losang states that the doubters are always free to leave if they don't support the 
Union of Hope
's mission, but Jacinta worries that they will rise up as well. Jacinta insists that the answer to doubt isn't faith, but rather proof. Proof will bolster the boy and strengthen the Union of Hope. Jacinta wants Losang to move up the ceremony as it would send a strong signal. Losang watches through the window as Laurent hugs Daryl and the two head off together as he considers Jacinta's words.

In a courtyard, Daryl tries to teach Laurent how to play American baseball. Joining them, Isabelle mistakes it for cricket, but Daryl corrects her, and she agrees to be their catcher after Laurent explains what that is. Laurent hits the ball, sending it into the bushes behind Daryl, much to the delight of everyone. Sylvie calls Laurent away for his philosophy class, causing the boy to complain that Jacinta will make him read Socrates. Isabelle tells him that Socrates is very entertaining, and they'll get the ball back.

Once Laurent is gone, Daryl expresses concern that Losang and his people are working him pretty hard, but Isabelle tells Daryl that he is too with teaching the boy sports, self-defense and tracking. Daryl states that he and Laurent are just having fun, and Isabelle tells him that Laurent needs balance, body and mind, which he is getting from both Daryl and the Union. Daryl points out that the boy isn't buying everything that the Nest is teaching him, and Isabelle acknowledges that Laurent is skeptical, a kid should question things and doubt is healthy. Daryl wonders if Isabelle ever doubts it, and she admits that she does. 
"You're not like them at all. You're like us,"
 says a pleased Daryl.

Isabelle knows that in a week or two, whenever he figures out a plan, Daryl will be gone, and she and Laurent will stay here at the Nest. There's always doubt, but people make choices that makes sense to them. Sometimes you let faith make up the difference which Isabelle believes that Daryl understands because how else does he get on a boat to the other side of the world. Daryl suggests that Isabelle could make a different choice and her, and Laurent come back to America with him. After a moment's hesitation, Isabelle refuses, stating that it's impossible because Laurent's entire life has led him to this place and it's everything that's kept them going. Daryl suggests that that's all that the Nest ever was: something that just kept them going.

The next morning, Isabelle wakes up and finds Laurent gone from his room with signs of a struggle and a grappling hook attached to the windowsill. Isabelle frantically searches for the boy, telling Daryl that Laurent has gone missing. Daryl notices sand on the floor of the room near the grappling hook and realizes that someone took him. Losang and Jacinta arrive, and Jacinta reports that two men climbed over the wall and knocked out 
Tarim
, their guard. Tarim reports that one of the men had a tattoo on his face, meaning that it was a Guerrier. Losang realizes that someone had told 
Genet
 where the Nest is and Laurent is being taken back to 
Paris
. Jacinta warns them that the tide will come in soon and they quickly move out.

Outside, a rescue team suits up, and Losang orders his men to bring Laurent home and to follow Daryl's lead. Jacinta gives one of the soldiers some rounds for Daryl's shotgun which he hands over to Daryl. Emile -- now with short hair -- objects to Fallou coming with them as the older man should rest and heal, but he insists upon going. Sylvie explains that she had told Fallou that she needs someone to keep an eye on Emile and she places her necklace on her boyfriend. Isabelle also joins the rescue mission despite Losang's objections that this could be dangerous, and the rescue team departs to find Laurent.

On the road to Paris, one of the soldiers stops the convoy, spotting an empty gas can on the side of the road and guessing that the Guerriers must've refueled. Daryl notices that two to three people went off on foot down a side road and the group moves down the road.

Outside of an 
abandoned mill
, Daryl reports to the others that he has spotted at least two people, but it's hard to tell if Laurent is there. There's only one way in and Daryl orders everyone to follow him. Daryl's team moves in and spots movement on a higher floor so Daryl splits the team with Daryl and Tarim and one other man going upstairs while Emile and Isabelle stay at the entrance and Fallou and two other men search the bottom floor.

Daryl, Tarim and the soldier climb to a higher level which is empty and head for another staircase leading up on the other side of the room. The two other men draw blades to attack Daryl who attempts to shoot them, but he was given dud shells for his shotgun. Daryl hits the two men with his shotgun and throws the unnamed Union soldier through a window to his death. From the next stairway, an archer fires at Daryl who quickly uses Tarim as a human shield. One of the archer's shots hits Tarim in the back, killing him. Before the woman she can shoot again, Isabelle enters and shoots her dead. As they move upstairs towards a final attacker, Isabelle recognizes the archer as someone who works in the stables at the Nest, meaning that they are being attacked by their own people. On the top floor, Isabelle shoots the last man as Daryl runs in, incapacitating him and allowing Daryl to stab the man to death. Shocked to see another Union soldier rather than a Guerrier, Isabelle wonders why they're doing this. Seeing the soldier fall to his death alerts Fallou as the men with him attack. Fallou quickly kills one with his 
Bow and Arrow
 and grapples with the other one, struggling with him over a knife on the floor. Emile enters the room, but he refuses to help Fallou. Fallou finally shoves the soldier off of him, grabs one of his spilled arrows, and stabs the man in the neck with it, killing him.

Emile turns on Fallou, ordering his former friend on his knees at gunpoint and telling Fallou that he had asked him not to come. Daryl and Isabelle enter, and Fallou tells them to return to the Nest, having realized that Laurent was still there. Emile forces Daryl and Isabelle to disarm themselves and Isabelle demands to know what he's doing. Emile states that neither Isabelle nor Fallou were meant to be here as the ambush was only meant for Daryl. Daryl suggests that Emile could still let the others go and he and Daryl can work this out, but Emile apologetically refuses, explaining that the 
"they were worried Laurent would leave. Everything the Union had fought for would be lost. Meaningless. Everything we did."
 Fallou tells Emile that he's confused and not thinking clearly while Isabelle tells him that they understand after everything that he went through.

Tearfully, Emile finally explains what he went through in captivity that has left the once strong man so broken: Emile was not physically tortured, rather he was forced to watch as the Power of the Living conducted their experiments and murdered their other prisoners. Emile calls them martyrs for the cause and no one will doubt it after tomorrow when there will be a ceremony to prove what they know: that Laurent is special. Emile points out that Isabelle had believed that Laurent's birth was a miracle and that he represents a future where they can no longer be hurt by the undead. A horrified Isabelle realizes that the Union is going to test Laurent's possible immunity to the 
Wildfire Virus
 which Emile confirms, confident that Laurent will not succumb to the bite, and it will be proven, dispelling all doubt. Isabelle challenges the young man to look around at the chaos, asking if this looks like salvation to him. Emile hesitates and Fallou tells him that it still can be salvation, but Emile states that 
"she said I'll be tempted. She said to be strong."
 and turns his gun to kill Daryl. However, Fallou shoves the gun away as it goes off and quickly subdues Emile. Isabelle grabs the dropped gun and turns it on its owner who grabs Sylvie's necklace, apparently accepting and even embracing his end. After a moment's hesitation, Isabelle shoots Emile in the head, killing her former friend.

Near the Nest, Daryl's group finds that it's not low tide, meaning that they must wait before they can cross back to the island. Fallou leaves to go make a perimeter, and Isabelle laments all of the years that she's believed in the Nest and Losang. Isabelle thought that it was the one thing that would save them, but Daryl reminds her that people have to believe in something. Isabelle tells him that her one job, the one that she had promised her sister 
Lily
, was to protect Laurent, and Daryl promises her that when the water goes back out, they'll go in and get him. Isabelle decides that after that, she and Laurent will go back to America with Daryl like he had offered before. Looking out at the sunset over the Nest, Isabelle tells Daryl that 
"there's a word in French -- dépaysant. It's hard to translate, it's like a... like a nice change of scenery. Makes you look at things a different way."
 Daryl likes it, and he and Isabelle kiss.



"
L'Invisible
"


On the ground below the monastery, 
Fallou
 leads Daryl and 
Isabelle
, searching for a place to climb up the wall. Daryl thinks that Isabelle will like 
Ohio
 where the 
winters
 suck, but the summers are nice with fishing in the streams and fireflies all over, confusing Isabelle as she doesn't know what fireflies are. Fallou finds a spot where they can climb, inching their way up to the top.

All of the Nest's residents gather in the courtyard for the ceremony. Unnoticed by anyone, Daryl, Isabelle and Fallou sneak in with Isabelle and Fallou standing amongst the crowd and Daryl on the stairs leading up to the parapet. As 
Losang
 speaks to the crowd, 
Jacinta
 and 
Gilbert
 lead a dazed and drugged Laurent in. 
"My friends, the time has come. From across 
France
, from 
Germany
, from 
Spain
, we've come as pilgrims to be part of this community out of a shared belief of faith in what is yet to come. The journey here has been long and hard. Some have had doubts at times. It's natural to doubt. We've had to be patient to prove that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, a future where we will no longer be vulnerable to the bite of the hungry ones. Now is the time to cast doubt aside and to embrace hope, to celebrate the inspiring power of our unity and love. We are all human, and even the hungry ones, lost to us, carry with them the memory of love. So, who better to confirm our faith in Laurent than someone we've just lost, but who loved him dearly. And now, her love will deliver us all."


As Losang speaks, a cloaked and tethered walker is led out into the middle of the courtyard where Laurent is guided to meet it. Much to her friends' shock and horror, the hood is removed to reveal a zombified 
Sylvie
 who is guided towards Laurent to bite the boy. Before Sylvie can bite Laurent, Daryl shoots her in the head with an arrow, putting his friend down and quipping that the 
"show's over motherfucker."
 Daryl takes aim at Losang, but he's forced to shoot a Union soldier instead when the man tries to shoot him, giving Losang the chance to escape. As the crowd runs around in a panic, Isabelle and Fallou grab Laurent and make their escape, as does Daryl.

Daryl's group
 reunites, making their way through the streets of the Nest. Daryl and Fallou shoot two Union soldiers that they encounter and hide in an alcove from the searching soldiers. Daryl orders the others to go back out the way that he, Isabelle and Fallou had come in while he buys them some time, rejecting Fallou's offer to stay and help him as it will take both of the other adults to get Laurent down the wall. Grabbing Laurent, Daryl tells the boy to snap out of it as he needs Laurent to lead Isabelle and Fallou to his and Daryl's secret place where they train together, 
a cave
 in the woods. Laurent snaps out of his drugged state, recalling the location of the cave, and Daryl tells the group to give him a day and to then keep running if Daryl doesn't make it back by then. With the coast temporarily clear, Isabelle, Laurent, and Fallou make their escape while Daryl engages two Union soldiers who spot him. Avoiding the attention of a guard on top of the parapet, Fallou and Laurent make it to the outer wall and escape, but Isabelle is forced to hide when the searchers get too close.

Daryl's fight takes him down a staircase where he slams one man's head into the wall, and then strangles the other with his 
bow
, ultimately breaking both the man's neck and his bow, forcing Daryl to abandon both the weapon and his arrows. Entering a room full of water equipment, Daryl ambushes a soldier coming down a staircase, throwing a life ring at him, knocking the man down the stairs, and then shooting the soldier with his own wrestled away gun. Daryl throws his 
knife
 into another soldier and grabs a 
Boat Hook
 as he fights a third soldier, pushing him into the way of the swinging axe of a fourth man, throwing them both to the ground. As another soldier charges, Daryl impales him in the neck with the boat hook, throws another man to the floor and uses the boat hook as a 
spear
 to impale the fourth attacking soldier as he recovers. Another man tackles Daryl through a table and briefly strangles him, but Daryl throws the man off of him and bashes his head in with a rock. Another soldier enters and the man who was thrown to the floor gets back up. Daryl impales his previous foe with the boat hook and swings the hook of a pulley into the last soldier. Daryl hides as a final soldier enters, ambushes him, and drives the man's own knife through his chin and into his brain. Taking both that knife and his own, Daryl heads up the staircase, stabbing to death a soldier at the top. Moving up through the streets of the Nest, Daryl stabs a final soldier to death before becoming cornered and being forced to surrender.

Daryl awakens tied to the floor and Losang admits that this wasn't how he'd wanted things to be. Losang had been hoping that they'd convince Daryl, his thinking would evolve, and he'd come around, but that didn't happen. Losang guesses that it must be hard to live without a semblance of faith, without an organizing principle, nothing to cling to, and existence simply spent reaching and reacting. 
"A man alone. It's a sad state."
 Daryl orders Losang to fuck off to his amusement, and Losang guesses that it's easy to reject faith when you live only for yourself. However, Losang has dedicated his life to a community of people that he has a responsibility to protect. 
"Faith and hope, our oxygen and water, elements crucial to our survival. And over time, our reserves, they've run low. Laurent will replenish them. The public display of his light will give our people the strength to continue on in the darkness. I meditated. I prayed on it. And I realized it's our love for Laurent. That's precisely why he's being called on to take this leap. Because only by risking everything can we find the true meaning of faith."
 Daryl asks what will happen if Losang is wrong and Losang tells him that there would be no point in going on if he's wrong. Losang again demands to know where the boy is, but Daryl remains silent.

A beaten Daryl is dragged into a cell area -- a converted shower room -- by a Union soldier and chained up. Daryl remains defiant in the face of more torture the next morning for the location of Laurent. On a table outside of the jail lies Daryl's knife and 
Daryl's Morning Star
.

At night, a beaten and weak Isabelle is led into the jail and chained up in the cell next to Daryl. Isabelle tells Daryl that she was separated from the others, but Laurent and Fallou got away. Daryl tells Isabelle that he didn't say anything to the Union, and Isabelle confirms that she didn't either. Daryl reassures her that Laurent will be fine, and they'll catch up to him, but they should get their strength back up so that they can escape the next day. Using her foot, Isabelle moves a small broken shower drain grate and collects it. Wanting to hear Daryl's voice, Isabelle asks him to tell her a story. 
"There was this guy. And he left 
home
, looking for something. Wasn't even sure what it was. And he found himself far, far away from home. And he couldn't get back. That's all he ever cared about, getting back. He didn't care about anything or anyone. Then one day, something changed. Dépaysant,"
 tells Daryl in a changed version of 
his original story
. Isabelle notes that change is good, and asks Daryl to describe the fireflies to her which he compares to Tinkerbell. Daryl thinks that Laurent is really going to like it when they get back home to America where Laurent can go to school and be like a normal kid. Daryl and Isabelle can do whatever she wants like sleep late, take long walks, and watch the sun go down by the river which Isabelle thinks sounds like a dream. The two hold hands, and Daryl acknowledges that Isabelle was right: he did find something in France. Isabelle tells Daryl in French that she loves him and Daryl grips her hand tighter, although he doesn't respond to her verbally.

Losang and two soldiers enter the jail and Losang tells Isabelle that they need to talk, but Daryl tells him that Isabelle has nothing to say to him. Losang knows that Isabelle is in pain and he wants to he help her deal with whatever confusion she's feeling, asking her to come with him and pray on it together. Losang asks for a chance to explain, feeling that they both deserve it after all that they've been through together, but Isabelle refuses. Nevertheless, Losang has 
one
 soldier unchain and take her. Daryl demands to know where Losang is taking Isabelle as she doesn't know anything, but Losang tells him that Isabelle knows that the Union has a mission here and a greater purpose. Daryl admits that he knows where Laurent and is and offers to take Losang to him, but Losang states that 
"Isabelle has always had an open mind and heart. You sadly are beyond hope,"
 and leaves. A guard who remains behind hits Daryl in the face with the butt of his rifle when Daryl persists, claiming that Laurent is in 
Provence
, and he frantically calls after Isabelle as she's taken away.

Unbeknownst to Daryl, 
Genet
 has found the Nest and is nearby preparing to launch an assault on it. Amongst the assault force is 
Carol
 who has come to France looking for Daryl after his disappearance from America.

[
]

Andrea
.

In "
Stalker
" he was stabbed in the leg by 
Alpha
.


In "
Deux Amours
" he's shown to have survived out at sea for an extended period of time before arriving at the shores of

Originally Daryl was never planned for the 
AMC
 show, however after 
Norman Reedus
' audition for the role of 
Merle Dixon
, the producers admired his performance so much they created Daryl Dixon specifically for Norman.

According to the 
Cutting Room Floor
 for 
Issue 65
, Daryl was originally going to die in "
Vatos
".


Daryl has been responsible for three of the original 
Atlanta group
 member's deaths.

He put Dale out of his misery by shooting him in the head.


His violent outburst during Abraham's execution resulted in Glenn's death.


He shot and killed Morales with a crossbow bolt because he had a gun pointed at Rick.


In addition, after the destruction of the Atlanta camp, Daryl used a pickaxe to put down those that had died before they could reanimate aside from 
Ed Peletier
 and 
Amy Harrison
 who were taken care of by Carol and 
Andrea
 instead.


Daryl won IGN's "Best TV Hero" of 2012.
[8]


Daryl's signature weapon is a Stryker 
crossbow
 which he also used before the apocalypse. Throughout the series, Daryl sometime changes a different model of the crossbow from time to time.

Starting in 
Season 9
, Daryl often uses a pair of 
dual-wielded large knives
 for close range combat. As revealed in an interview by 
Angela Kang
, the knives were custom designed with 
Norman Reedus
' help to make sure that Daryl had a good secondary weapon for hand-to-hand combat as the characters were starting to be more stingy with their bullets going into 
Season 9
 and a 
crossbow
 is difficult to reload so it's not good for quick combat.
[9]


After joining the 
Commonwealth Army
, Daryl appears to adopt an 
AR-15
 as his preferred weapon instead of his crossbow.


Daryl has been one of the most frequent users of Rick's 
Colt Python
, and at one point carried it after Judith refused to take it before he returned it to her.


Daryl has been captured ten times.

He was captured in the episode "
Made to Suffer
" by Woodbury and forced to fight his brother Merle.


He was captured a second time in the episode "
A
" by 
Gareth
 at 
Terminus
.


He was captured again by Dwight and 
The Saviors
 in "
East
" after he and 
Rosita
 were trying to free 
Glenn
 and 
Michonne
.


He was captured in the episode "
The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
" after being recaptured by the Saviors because Negan liked the way he stood up to him.


He was captured along with Michonne in "
Scars
" by Jocelyn and her kids.


He was in the episode "
The Calm Before
" when he, along with Michonne, Carol, and Yumiko were captured by the Whisperers, however they were released afterwards.


In a flashback, he was temporarily captured in the episode "
Find Me
" by 
Leah
 in her 
cabin
.


He was captured in "
Rendition
" by the 
Reapers
 before reluctantly joining them.


In a flashback, he was captured in the episode "
Deux Amours
" by 
Pouvoir
's people on their 
boat
.


He was captured again by Pouvoir's people in the episode "Deux Amours" in 
Maison Mère
, along with 
Quinn
.


Daryl has the highest number of appearances than any other character in the show, appearing in a total of 148 episodes.

Additionally, Daryl's pet, 
Dog
, is the animal with the most appearances in the show, appearing in 25 episodes.


Daryl's crossbow has been stolen 6 times on the show.

The first time was by 
Shumpert
 when he was captured by 
The Governor
 and forced to fight Merle.


The second time was when the group attempted to flee Terminus, but were guided by multiple gunshots to a train car, and being made to drop their weapons for confiscation.


The third was when 
Carol
 and Daryl visited 
Atlanta
 in 
Season 5
 while looking for 
Beth
, but got held-up by 
Noah
 in an abandoned building.


The fourth time was when he saved Dwight and 
Sherry
 in the woods from the Saviors and Dwight double crossed him, stealing his bow and motorcycle.


The fifth time was by Dwight again when he shot Daryl in his upper shoulder area and added him into Negan's lineup.


The sixth time was when he was captured by the Power of the Living and brought aboard their ship.


Daryl has the highest number of uses of the 
walker guts trick
 aside from 
Nicholas Clark
 in 
Fear the Walking Dead
.

In "
Bonds
", Daryl snaps a walker's neck and uses its blood to disguise himself from both 
the Whisperers
 and a nearby herd.


In "
A Certain Doom
", Daryl uses the walker guts trick in order to sneak out through the Whisperers' horde surrounding 
the Tower
 and then to sneak into the horde and assassinate the Whisperers.


In "
Rendition
", Daryl covers himself in walker guts after getting separated from the others by 
the Reapers
, presumably in order to avoid attention from any passing herds that he encounters.


In "
The Rotten Core
", Daryl and Rosita reluctantly use the walker guts trick in order to infiltrate 
Cooper's House
 and retrieve money for 
Sebastian Milton
.


Daryl has joined or infiltrated an enemy group on two occasions before later helping his friends to take them down.

From "
Alone
" to "
A
", Daryl joins 
the Claimers
 before helping his friends to wipe them out.


After being captured by 
the Reapers
 in "
Rendition
", Daryl joins and infiltrates the group before revealing his true allegiance in "
For Blood
" and helping to take them out in "For Blood" and "
No Other Way
".


Daryl is the longest male living character of the TV Series, and the second longest living character behind Carol.


Skybound
 published a 
2014 April Fools Joke
 in which it was "spoiled" that Daryl would appear in 
Issue 129
 of the 
Comic Series
.

Though Daryl is a fan favorite on the show, 
Kirkman
 confirmed that he has no interest in including him in the comics.
[10]
 Daryl never appeared in the 
Comic Series
.


Daryl displays several stereotypes of a 
redneck
.

He possesses a southern American accent.


His most consistent trait is his aggressive and hostile demeanor.


He has shown to have a fondness for alcohol.


He has shown to be a chain-smoker.


Daryl may be a 
motorcycle enthusiast
 - this can be theorized through several hints throughout the series.

He owns a personal motorcycle jacket


He drove a 
1976 Triumph Bonneville 
Hardtail Frame Conversion
, which was originally owned by his older brother Merle.


When questioned by 
Aaron
, Daryl dryly remarks, "I ride bikes".


Daryl appears to have a proficient knowledge of mechanical engineering where he has been seen repairing several broken vehicles to the point of being able to construct a fully working 
1992 Honda CB 750 Nighthawk
 out of spare parts in a garage.


In "
Still
", Beth guesses that Daryl was a motorcycle mechanic before the apocalypse, which is what Norman Reedus did before he became an actor.


Daryl possesses several tattoos including one located on his left chest which says 'Norman' - (Reedus' own and father's name), a small devil located on his upper right arm, a red tattoo with the name "Mingus" (Norman's son's name), two individual demons located on his back and a skull on his right hand.


On 
Talking Dead
 for "
Coda
", Robert Kirkman confirmed that Daryl is straight, if slightly asexual, as previous fan theories suggested that Daryl was gay and Kirkman himself had alluded to the possibility.


Daryl had previously owned Beth's Browning Hunter Knife, which he kept as a memento of her, which was possibly taken by Dwight.


Daryl has killed the fourth largest amount of living characters on the TV Universe with a total of at least 150 victims, 
Simon
 has the third largest with a total of at least 170, Negan has the second largest with a total of at least 235 and Rick has the largest with a total of at least 3,070 victims.


Coincidentally, whenever the group comes into conflict with an antagonistic force, Daryl often finds himself with the 
antagonists
 in some way and is separated from 
Rick's group
. When the Survivors began a conflict with the Governor, Daryl left with Merle. When the Survivors encountered 
The Claimers
, Daryl was associated with them. Right after meeting Negan, Daryl is then held captive by the Saviors and shortly after meeting Alpha, he, Carol, Michonne, and Yumiko are then temporarily held captive by the Whisperers. When the Reapers attacked his group and killing several of their people, Daryl is captured by them and is forced to join them temporarily.


Daryl is one of three original Atlanta camp members still alive out of 33 others. Rick and Carol are the other ones.


Originally, Daryl was named Dwight in the scripts for Season 1.
[11]


The "A" on Daryl's sweatshirt while in Savior captivity stands for "asshole", as confirmed by 
Angela Kang
. She also revealed Daryl was supposed to be in a factory jumpsuit, but they did not want it to look similar to the jumpsuits worn by the DHARMA Initiative in 
Lost
.
[11]


Daryl bears a scar, similar of a black eye, on his right eye due to the fight with 
The Claimers
 in the 
Season 4
 
finale episode
.


In "
East
" Daryl lost his vest after getting shot by Dwight who took it from him and wore it. Thus Season 7 was the only season where Daryl wasn't seen wearing his vest. He would finally get it back from a wounded Dwight in "
How It's Gotta Be
".


As of "
The Cell
" onwards, Daryl appears to no longer wear any kind of sleeveless shirt. The last time he did was in "
The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
".


As of "
Stradivarius
", Daryl is missing the whole right wing off of his vest, first only missing half of his right wing in "
What Comes After
".


In "
Omega
" Daryl told 
Lydia
 how some abusive fathers are, possibly referring how Daryl was abused in his past. This is more noticeable in "
Home
", when Merle rips off Daryl's shirt, revealing the scars on his back.


Daryl has the most scars among any other characters in the series.


In 
Season 9
, Daryl, like Michonne, bares an 
X
 shaped scar on his back. "
Scars
" reveals he was branded this scar by 
Linus
, on 
Jocelyn
's orders. Interestingly Daryl already had a x scar back in "Home".
