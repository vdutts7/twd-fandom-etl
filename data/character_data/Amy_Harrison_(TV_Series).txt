Overview
[
]


Still young, Amy was impetuous and eternally optimistic. She helped look out for the kids in the camp, was quick to defend others' actions when she saw them as being protective and generally tried to keep the peace among her fellow survivors.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


Amy was born in 1986, twelve years younger than Andrea and that caused no small amount of tension between the sisters. However, she was resentful of Andrea leaving her behind at home when she went to college and not coming back often enough to visit on her birthdays. She often went on many fishing trips with her father during her childhood. She was living in Atlanta where she was attending college and lived in a dorm room.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Metro-
Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


During the onset of the outbreak, Amy and Andrea were heading back to Amy's college after their trip when they were stranded in 
Atlanta
. As the city was overrun, they were rescued by 
Dale Horvath
. Sometime later, they encountered and joined a campsite of survivors outside the outskirts of the city.

"
Days Gone Bye
"


In a 
camp
 outside the city, a group of survivors, among them Amy, receive 
Rick
's transmission. She runs to the CB, but can't get a reply. By the time Shane takes over the CB controls and introduces himself, Rick has left the emergency broadcast channel.

Lori voices that she's been saying for a week that they should put signs up on the highway warning people away from the city, and volunteers to go on her own, but Dale and Shane argue that venturing out is too risky. Lori walks off and Shane goes after her. 



"
Guts
"


In the camp, Amy dumps mushrooms from a bucket into a bowl held by Lori, who sits at a fire pit. Amy asks how to tell if the mushrooms are poisonous, to which Lori replies they would have to eat one to know. Amy, unsatisfied with that method, tells Lori to ask Shane when he gets back. Lori nods, before she excuses herself to look for more mushrooms in the forest. 

Later that day, Amy frets over the whereabouts of the group and her sister to Dale, who reasons with her that worrying won't make it better. Suddenly, the radio crackles and squeaks, and T-Dog's garbled transmission comes through, explaining that they're trapped in the department store, surrounded by hundreds of walkers. Dale responds to the transmission but only radio silence follows. 
"We do not go after them. We do not risk the rest of the group,"
 Shane insists. Amy argues that Andrea's life is at risk, but Shane tells her she's gone. Amy is furious, exclaiming 
"That's my sister, you son-of-a-bitch!"
 and storms off.



"
Tell It to the Frogs
"


When Andrea's group returns from the city, she and her sister reunite by sharing a big embrace, hugging. When 
Carl Grimes
 and 
Sophia Peletier
 find a zombie outside of camp, Amy and the other adults go into the woods to investigate. She and Andrea look away in disgust as Dale chops the zombie's head off. Later, while doing laundry at the quarry with Andrea, 
Jacqui
, and 
Carol Peletier
, she and the women share what they miss most, hers being her computer and texting. When Ed comes around and begins snapping at the women, telling Carol it is time to go, Andrea intervenes and sticks up for Carol, while Amy tries to prevent a fight by asking Andrea to stop. After 
Ed Peletier
 slaps Carol, Amy pulls Carol away from Ed while Andrea and Jacqui hold him back to prevent him from causing further harm to her. Amy gives Carol over to Andrea, and all of the women watch in shock as Shane beats Ed senseless.



"
Vatos
"


Amy is on the lake fishing with her sister, and the two share their experiences fishing with their dad, sharing how he raised them differently according to their feelings and character. She and Andrea return to camp with a whole string of fish, but their excitement is interrupted as 
Dale Horvath
 explains the situation with 
Jim
. She witnesses the confrontation of Jim as he digs strange holes on the hillside.

Later that night, she is around the campfire for the fish fry dinner. After Dale explains about his watch's story, the camp goes silent, until Amy breaks it saying, "You are so weird". The group bursts out in laughter. During the feast, Amy excuses herself to go use the RV's bathroom. The camp is suddenly attacked by walkers. When an unaware Amy exits the RV to inform the group there is no more toilet paper, she is suddenly accosted by a walker that bites into her arm. The same walker then bites into her collarbone until it is killed by Jim. Andrea comes to her rescue and tries to stop her bleeding. Once all of the walkers at the camp are killed, Andrea continues to hold Amy in her arms. Amy then dies in a devastated Andrea's arms while Andrea begins loudly sobbing and shaking her sister's corpse.



"
Wildfire
"


Andrea stays up all night holding Amy's body in her arms, refusing to move in order to let the rest of the camp deal with her body to prevent her from reanimating. Andrea acknowledges that today is her birthday, and places the mermaid necklace around Amy's neck. Soon enough, Amy reanimates as a walker, and still holding her in her arms, Andrea tearfully apologizes to her before shooting her in the side of her head, putting her down for good.

Amy is later buried during the funeral for the fallen campers.

"
Hounded
"


Rick begins receiving phone calls from individuals who he believes are part of another group. The first call is from a young woman who is shocked to have made contact with someone. She reveals that she is with others and in a safe place, but she is cautious not to reveal the location. She seems willing to help, but insists on speaking with her people before taking in Rick and the other survivors. Despite Rick's pleading, she hangs up. Rick later receives a phone call from Lori, who informs him that the people he had spoken to all day were Amy, Jim, and Jacqui.

Trivia
[
]


Amy is the only recurring character to have a promotional poster in 
Season 1

Amy is one of four characters to have their birthday acknowledged and celebrated after the apocalypse.

The other three are 
Felix Carlucci
, 
Gladys Cruz
, and 
Mike Palmer
.


Ironically, Amy died the night before her birthday.


In the original teleplay script for "
Days Gone Bye
", Amy's character was given the name 
Rachel 
(though her role remained otherwise unchanged).
