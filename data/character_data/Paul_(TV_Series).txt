Overview
[
]


Paul is a rebellious and courageous man, who cares about the safety of himself and the people around him, even if it that means standing up to his leaders. After 
Rick
's group attack the town, Paul is among those who try to leave 
Woodbury
. Though Paul is convinced to stay, he is shown to reluctant and rather unimpressed. Paul is then forced to join the 
army
 and helps invade the prison, however he retreats with the others. When the 
Governor
 angrily orders the militia to go back the to the prison, they refuse, with Paul being one of the most vocal. Paul stands up to his leaders and is about to go back to Woodbury. However, he is then shot down by the Governor in act of rage along with the rest of the militia. Ironically, he states that he and the others don't want to fight for a place full of psychopaths, when their leader is the most psychopathic of them all.

"
The Suicide King
"
[
]


Paul is first seen the morning after the raid on their town by Rick's group. He is one of the angry and scared townspeople attempting to leave Woodbury. As 
Karen
 pleads with 
Shumpert
 and 
Martinez
 to let them leave, Paul demands the guards to let them out. He watches as one man is kicked off the wall as he attempts to leave, and another man pulled from his car after he refuses to stop honking at the gate. Moments later, screaming is heard from within Woodbury and people are fleeing down the street. The walls had been breached and several zombies have invaded the streets. A group of them managed to attack 
Richard Foster
 and seriously injure him with several bites. Paul watches in horror as the 
Governor
 walked up to Richard lying in the street and shot him in the head, out of mercy and annoyance, and because of Richard's cries of agony. 

Later that day, after Andrea gave her speech about why everyone should stay in the town and rebuild, Paul agreed with her, but otherwise looked unimpressed.
