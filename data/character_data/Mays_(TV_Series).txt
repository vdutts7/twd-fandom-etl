“


You wanna hear about 
family?
 When I was with my brother and his family and we were on the road, and I saved their lives more times than I can count, and then one day I wake up and there's my brother, 
stealing the last of my food.
 And he just stares at me, and then he comes at me with a knife. I handled it... but I didn't blame my brother, 'cause he gave me something 
valuable
 that day.

Overview
[
]


Mays is initially shown to be a cruel and ruthless man. After he caught his 
brother
 stealing food from him, he forced him and his family to play Russian roulette in a twisted act of revenge. When given the choice between shooting himself or his family, his brother chose to kill his 
wife
 and his 
niece
. As punishment, Mays locked his brother in the attic with his family's corpses. After this, Mays became extremely cynical and pessimistic, believing all humans to be selfish and evil. After encountering, 
Gabriel
 and 
Aaron
, he attempts to prove his point by forcing them to also play Russian roulette. However, he finds that the two are good people who don't turn on each other. It appears Mays may be redeemable, as after some convincing he lets Gabriel and Aaron go. However, he is immediately killed by Gabriel, being seen as too dangerous to bring in to 
Alexandria
, making it unknown if Mays would've changed his ways.

Mays watches Gabriel from across the room and asks for some boar. Gabriel sits across from Mays as he eats boar. Mays tells Gabriel that he lives at the warehouse and that Gabriel and Aaron stole his boar. He reveals that he has Aaron's mace arm, then shoots at a room where he's holding Aaron. Gabriel tries to appeal to the man's faith in God, but Mays says he was merely using the Bibles for toilet paper. Mays drags Aaron out of the room and forces them to play Russian roulette. Gabriel and Aaron take turns shooting at their own heads. The chamber is empty each time. Mays explains that he killed his 
brother
 and his brother's 
fam
ily
 after catching his brother stealing his food. Gabriel invites Mays to join their community. Mays agrees and cuts Aaron loose. Gabriel kills Mays with the mace attachment on Aaron's

"Where were you cooking? (...) I said... what were you cooking? (...) Boar... how was it? The boar, how was it? (...) 
I'd like a bite.
"
- Mays asking about Gabriel's boar, "
One More
"





"Seems like you're the ones who are wanting. The one breaking into my place, eating my boar, drink my whiskey. 
(chuckles)
 So you figured that boar... got into that room by 
itself?
 (...) 
(takes out Aaron's mace arm)
 Does this say no harm to you?"
- Mays accusing Gabriel and Aaron of robbing him, "
One More
"





"You think it's loaded? (...) 
(sporadically fires bullets at room)
 You think he made it? (...) Your friend. 
(points at room)
 He's in there... Easy! 
(checks on Aaron)
 Still breathing I think!"
- Mays to Gabriel about his gun, "
One More
"





"Why do you wear that? (...) Your collar. Why are you still wearing it? (...) 
Toilet paper.
 (...) The Bibles... are my toilet paper. I like the thin pages, I can find them everywhere. (...) Yeah I read it. 
Cover to cover
, that's why I wipe my 
ass
 with it. Must be hard preaching about something you don't believe in."
- Mays to Gabriel about his faith and the Bible, "
One More
"





"Evil people aren't exception to the rule. They 
are
 the rule. (...) A drunk tongue's an honest one. There's nothing left in this world but 
thieves
 and 
murderers.
 (...) Who are you trying to convince padre? Me or you? You're so 
close.
"
- Mays to Gabriel about his cynical view on the world, "

"One round. One in six chance. Well you got a choice! Each time you can point it at yourself or the man sittin' across from ya. 
Winner goes home.
"
- Mays forcing Gabriel and Aaron to play Russian roulette, "

"
(to Aaron)
 What happened to your arm?

 Who blinded you? (...) Quiet! Pick it up and point it at your head or his, now. 
NOW!
"
- Mays asking about Aaron and Gabriel's injuries, "

family?
 When I was with my brother and his family and we were on the road, and I saved their lives more times than I can count, and then one day I wake up and there's my brother, 
stealing the last of my food.
 And he just stares at me, and then he comes at me with a knife. (...) I handled it... but I didn't blame my brother, 'cause he gave me something 
valuable
 that day."
- Mays about his brother, "
One More
"





"You pull that trigger. I said 
pull it!
 Him or you!? Who it's gonna be!? What about Gracie? You want to see her again don't you? When then you know what you gotta do! Don't look at him! 
You want to see your daughter again or not!?
 (...) 
THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?
 
THREE! TWO! ONE! STOP!
 
(points at himself)
 
THIS IS WHO PEOPLE ARE! THIS IS TRUTH!
"
