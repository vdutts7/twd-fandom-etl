Livits
 and Zell are at it again. You know, the two that are always flirting with each other. The big guy... Livits. The skinny one... Zell. I overheard stuff when were on the wagon, and I remember things about people, you know? Like, Zell is from Cleveland. Livits hurt his leg, so he favors the left one. (‚Ä¶) Oh, and Livits and Zell are having sex, but they don't want anyone to know. (‚Ä¶) Yeah, but it's obvious from the way they're not looking at each other that they're jonesing for it.
