Overview
[
]


Sturgess is an incompetent, cowardly, panicky, and inexperienced survivor. Against walkers, he is shown to be utterly useless. Though he does seem to want to do some good since he joins the group in keeping the 
walkers
 on the road. However, when the plan starts to go wrong, he becomes quite pessimistic. When walkers attack again, he tries to shoot them with his gun but he is extremely nervous and shaky. All he ends up doing is accidentally shooting 
Scott
 in the leg which made the trip back to 
Alexandria
 even harder. Sturgess panics after doing this and runs away into the woods. Later it's revealed that he didn't make it far and is devoured by walkers.



Pre-Apocalypse

Location Unknown

Nothing is known about Sturgess' life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[

Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Sturgess joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where, upon being interviewed by 
Deanna
, he was appointed as one of the gardeners.



Season 6

"
First Time Again
"
[
]


Sturgess is among the volunteers to help build the wall on one of the roads to deter the mega herd in the operation to lure it away from Alexandria. One day as they are in mid-construction, he and the other Alexandrians are almost bitten by walkers until 
Morgan
 saves them as opposed to 
Rick
's suggestion of forcing the scared residents to learn how to defend themselves. When the walkers break free from the quarry and the plan is set into motion, Sturgess goes along with 
Scott
, 
Annie
, 
Glenn
, 
Nicholas
, and 
Heath
 to keep walkers from straggling off the road with flares.

When a part of the herd ventures away from the road into the woods due to a 
blaring horn
 coming from Alexandria, the group runs through the woods in an attempt to return to the community. As they are attacked by walkers, Sturgess tries to fight them off but accidentally shoots Scott in the leg. He then panics and runs away from the group on his own, however, he is ambushed in a nearby town and devoured by several walkers. A while later, the group finds Sturgess' hat lost on the streets of the town, followed by his lifeless corpse, still being eaten by the walkers.
