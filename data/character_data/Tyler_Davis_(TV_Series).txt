Overview
[
]


Tyler is a rebellious individual who generally seems to have good intentions. He was a soldier for the 
Commonwealth
 and was quite friendly and open to 
Princess
, helping to convince Princess to be honest about 
her group
 and their intentions. Tyler was respected and liked by General 
Michael Mercer
 who recommended him for early promotion, as noted by 
Connie
. However, after getting beat up by Princess, Tyler is dishonorably discharged instead. He reveals that after this he had lost everything and could no longer provide for his family. He tried to contact 
Pamela
 but didn't get a response. Later, Tyler is seen trying to talk with Pamela face to face, but she ignores him. Tyler becomes angered by the inequality and corruption in the Commonwealth and causes a ruckus at the party. He takes 
Max
 hostage and confronts Pamela on who she truly is. Tyler immediately shows remorse and apologizes to Max before fleeing. When 
Daryl
 finds him, Tyler almost commits suicide but stops himself at the thought of his family.

When Tyler later resurfaces at the Commonwealth prison camp at 
Alexandria
, his enslavement seems to have driven all of the fire and hope from the young man and he refuses to join 
Negan
 and 
Ezekiel
's brewing revolt. Tyler suggests that he's been involved in or at least seen other revolts in the past which ended with good people dying, convincing Tyler that the only choices are survival by cooperating or dying by fighting back. However, after Ezekiel makes a stand to protect Negan and 
Annie
, Tyler bravely joins a number of other prisoners in risking their own lives defending them, convincing 
Roberts
 and most of the soldiers to stand down.

After joining the 
Coalition
, Tyler expresses remorse for his past actions and does his best to help his new friends take down Pamela and find their missing children. While Princess is uninterested in Tyler's apologies, 
Magna
, 
Kelly
 and Connie, who are pleased to have finally found Tyler, are more forgiving and understanding. Tyler ultimately dies redeemed for his mistakes, bravely leading the charge into 
Union Station
 where he meets his demise. Even though Tyler ultimately meets his demise, his efforts to help prove successful posthumously as 
Rosita
, 
Eugene
 and 
Gabriel
 are able to find the missing children right where Tyler thought that they might be and rescue them. His dream of getting equality for everyone in the Commonwealth is also fulfilled with the overthrowing of Pamela and the creation of a new government led by Ezekiel.

Season 10
[
]


"
A Certain Doom
"
[
]


Tyler appears at the 
Southern Train Yard
 where 
Eugene
, 
Ezekiel
, 
Yumiko
, and 
Juanita
 are waiting for 
Stephanie
. He and other members of the 
Commonwealth Army
 rush in pointing their weapons at them, demanding them to put their hands in the air and drop their weapons.



"
Splinter
"
[
]


Tyler and his fellow soldiers proceed to take Eugene's group into custody, splitting them up into train cars. Later that day, Tyler brings lunch to Juanita's train car when he is suddenly ambushed by her. Caught off guard, Tyler is disarmed and handcuffed before being questioned by Juanita. He explains that everything going on is standard procedure and to ensure the members of her group are trustworthy individuals before being brought back to their 
massive community
. After beating Tyler, the hallucinating Juanita snaps out of her episode and apologizes for her actions, explaining that she has been suffering from PTSD, ADHD, and other disorders. He tells her that it doesn't matter anymore and that her group is being rejected, to which she pleads for another chance. Tyler agrees to try and help their case if she answered his 
boss
' questions. After listening to her answers, Tyler tells her that she can see her friends now and opens the train car door, revealing Eugene, Yumiko, and Ezekiel standing outside with black hoods over their heads. Tyler then suddenly puts a hood over Juanita's head and handcuffs her.



Season 11
[
]


"
New Haunts
"
[
]


Tyler appears at 
Pamela Milton
's private ball for the upper class of the Commonwealth as a waiter serving food, having been dishonorably discharged from the 
Commonwealth Army
. Juanita immediately recognizes him as the soldier that she had ambushed in the train cars. During Pamela's speech where she states she cares for all the citizens of the Commonwealth, Tyler angrily interrupts her and accuses her of not protecting the lower class. When guards attempt to intervene, he holds 
Max
 at knifepoint. Pamela is able to talk him into releasing Max, and he flees the ball.

Daryl Dixon
 catches up with him in the Halloween maze. Despondent over what happened, Tyler laments that he just wanted to talk to Pamela, but he was ignored for months. He states that him 
"breaking protocol"
 and being assaulted by Juanita resulted in him losing both his home as well as his job, leaving him with nothing to help provide his sister or her children with. He attempts to 
slit his throat
 with his knife, but Daryl is able to convince him not to do it, stating that his sister and her children are his biological family, something that not many people have anymore, and that he shouldn't abandon them. Tyler relents, and drops the knife. Daryl places him under arrest, and as he is being escorted back to the ball by 
Sebastian Milton
 so he can be taken away by the guards, Tyler shouts, 
"resist the Commonwealth! Visibility for workers, equality for all!"
, and that there are thousands of resistors just like him in the Commonwealth, prompting Pamela to order a search in the lower class areas of the Commonwealth for potential rebels.



"
Rogue Element
"
[
]


While working for the Commonwealth's newspaper, 
Connie
 attempts to run a story about Tyler's actions at the ball. 
Her boss
 rejects the idea, and tells Connie to drop it. Later, Connie and 
Kelly
 visit the Commonwealth's hospital in an attempt to get an interview with Tyler, who is supposedly being treated for psychological issues, but are kept from entering his room by Commonwealth soldiers. Mercer looks at them through the door before shutting it. 

Connie and Kelly are sent out to report on Mercer and his soldiers' efforts to control a nearby herd of walkers. When Mercer finishes clearing the last of them, he walks over to Connie for a brief interview. Connie asks what Tyler has been charged with to warrant him being in the hospital for a month under armed guard. Mercer refuses to answer the question, as it isn't one of the questions "they sent you." 

Later that day, when Mercer returns to the hospital, he finds that Tyler is no longer in his room, his bed vacant. When he is informed by the 
nurse
 that Tyler was moved to an undisclosed location without his authorization, Mercer angrily punches the wall and leaves. 

That night, while in their apartment, Connie and Kelly are slipped a piece of paper under their door with a list of names on it, the last of which is Tyler's.



"
Faith
"
[
]


While working at the Commonwealth labor camp outside of 
Alexandria
, 
Princess
 recognizes Tyler, who now has longer hair, amongst the workers. Princess points Tyler out to 
Ezekiel
, reminding Ezekiel that Tyler had been at the 
railyard
 with them. Ezekiel remembers Tyler taking 
Max
 hostage and Princess tells Ezekiel that while she didn't say that she likes Tyler, 
"he's got balls. Might be useful."


Later, Ezekiel and 
Negan
 approach Tyler in the mess hall as he eats. Ezekiel tells Tyler that they know that he stood up to 
Pamela
 and wants out of there just as much as they do. However, Tyler tells them that he wants to live, but Negan tells Tyler that this isn't living, it's barely surviving. Ezekiel suggests that they can take the guards, their people and Tyler's and take control, but Tyler reveals that they've tried that before and 
"the same thing always happens: people who shouldn't die end up dead."
 Tyler believes that they have only two choices: survival or death and that if they try this, they all die. Ezekiel tries to convince Tyler that they can try this and live and that they only have each other. If they lose faith in the idea that they change things, they're as good as dead anyway. After Negan is dragged away by two soldiers, Tyler tells Ezekiel that he's on his own and leaves.

That night, Tyler and the other prisoners are brought before the mill to witness Negan's 
execution
 for plotting a rebellion with 
the Warden
 adding 
Annie
 in order to prevent Negan from becoming a martyr. When Ezekiel makes a stand to protect Negan and Annie, Tyler, despite his earlier refusal to help, joins a number of the other prisoners in standing with Ezekiel, positioning himself next to 
Nabila
. The Warden orders them all to be executed, but Ezekiel is able to talk down a majority of the soldiers with 
Roberts
 killing 
Sanborn
 and 
Daryl
 subduing the Warden, retaking Alexandria from the Commonwealth. Alongside the other former prisoners, Tyler watches as Rosita feeds the Warden to a zombified Sanborn in 
revenge
 for the Warden refusing to tell Rosita where her missing 
daughter
 is.



"
Family
"
[
]


The morning after the rebellion, 
Gabriel
 asks Tyler if he knows anything that he can help them find the missing children. Tyler reveals that, when he was a soldier, kids without parents were taken to the city's 
children's home
. However, Tyler doesn't know where it is and Gabriel orders him to find out so Tyler heads over to the captured soldiers to question them.

On the train to 
the Commonwealth
, Tyler helps 
Princess
 as she works on the long-range radio. Tyler recalls the 
last time
 that he was in a situation like this with Princess and apologizes for what he did, but Princess doesn't have time for it and she directs Tyler to hold the radio antenna through the roof of the boxcar.

Watching Tyler, 
Connie
 has 
Kelly
 tell Tyler that she's happy that they found him. Kelly explains that they have been looking for Tyler ever since he disappeared after 
Pamela
's party. Sympathetic, 
Magna
 tells Tyler that society had thrown him away and he was just desperate and mad which she can relate to. Tyler admits that he had wanted Pamela to hear him, but that he shouldn't have hurt people to do it along with a lot of other things that he shouldn't have done. Through Kelly's translations, Connie tells Tyler that he can fix his mistakes. While Pamela wouldn't listen to him, soon the people in the Commonwealth will which cheers him up slightly. Tyler and Princess' efforts with the radio ultimately prove successful and Princess manages to contact General 
Michael Mercer
 on the radio. Tyler listens as Mercer agrees to help them and reveals that, if Tyler and the other prisoners can be brought to him, Mercer can use them as witnesses to have legal grounds to remove Pamela from power.

Tyler joins the group that enters 
Union Station
 through Tunnel H. However, 
Daryl
 quickly deduces that something isn't right when no one is around and the doors are chained shut. Tyler calls out that they're almost there, but Daryl, realizing the trap, yells for everybody to get down. Pamela's men open fire, killing Tyler, an 
Alexandrian
, and two former Commonwealth prisoners standing near him as everyone else scatters.

Quotes
[

The following is a list of some of Tyler's most memorable quotes.





Season 10




"I meant what I said. What we stand for is 
real.
 This? All this, is standard protocol and mission based assignments. We have paperwork to fill out for Christ's sake. The place we live is a good 
place.
 It's our job to keep the many, many good people who live there safe. We're careful because we have a lot to lose. Don't you get that?"
- Tyler as he is being interrogated by Princess, "
Splinter
"





"I can't do that. (…) Because I don't know! My orders were to keep you fed until they were ready. (…) You don't get it! I'm just a 
grunt!
 I don't get the kind of intel you want, alright? Three square meals and uniform, that's it! Hey! Alright! You have to believe me! Look, I'm on probation as it is, they're gonna discharge me for this, getting snatched up by some chick. (…) I'm just a rookie. I'm so new that rifle isn't even 
loaded!
"
- Tyler to Princess about his role in the Commonwealth, "
Splinter
"





"They won't care. (…) No, no, no. I screwed up. I have to face the 
consequences,
 okay? And you and your friends, God bless you, good luck. You have to go back to whatever 
shitty corner
 of the world you came from."
- Tyler to Princess about them being kicked out, "
Splinter
"





"Didn't have to be hard. Rules are simple, the questions are routine. People just 
complicate
 them. Just needed to know you could play ball with us."
- Tyler to Princess about the rules, "
Splinter
"





Season 11




"This is 
bullshit!
 Does anyone here really believe the Commonwealth cares for all its citizens? Do you know who I am? 
(takes Max hostage)
 Don't come any closer! Don't come any closer, I just want to 
talk!
 Will you please just talk to me!? I would have died for this place! What's my name!? (…) Tyler Davis. I was a trooper. I tried and I tried to reach you. One mistake and I lost everything! I came here to talk to you. To 
make
 you listen. (…) Don't lie! This is what you care about! Fancy parties and paintings! 
(cuts William's painting)
 We're nothing to you! Disposable!"
- Tyler confronting Pamela, "
New Haunts
"





"Shit, I didn't mean to-- I just wanted to talk to her! To get her to 
understand.
 But it's never gonna happen. 
(puts knife to throat)
 I screwed up protocol, with a prisoner, I got 
beat up.
 Lost my apartment, my spending card... I have no way to help my sister or kids!"
- Tyler to Daryl about losing everything, "
New Haunts
"





"You think getting rid of me solves anything? There are thousands more like me. Resist the Commonwealth! Visibility for workers! Equality for 
all
!"
- Tyler to Pamela while being apprehended by soldiers, "
New Haunts
"





"I want to live. (…) What, like we haven't tried that before? The same thing always happens. People who shouldn't die end up 
dead.
 Two choices here, 
survival
 or 
that.
 You got a taste of it today. So you people try this, we all 
die.
 (…) You're on your own."
- Tyler to Ezekiel and Negan about taking back the Outpost, "
Faith
"





"When I was a soldier kids without parents would end up at the city's children's home."
- Tyler to Gabriel about where the kids are, "
Family
"





"Weird ending up in a place like this again, with you. Sorry about what happened."
- Tyler apologizing to Princess, "
Family
"





"Come on guys, we're almost there!"
- Tyler's last words to the group before being shot down, "
Family
"
