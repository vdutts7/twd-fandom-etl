Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[

Nothing is known about Aphid's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Aphid somehow came into contact with a group named "the Wolves" which he subsequently joined upon where he marked his own forehead with the letter "W".

Aphid aided his group in killing other survivors around the area to take their supplies or to make them turn so they could serve as a trap. They would also carve the letter "W" into their victims' foreheads.



Season 6

[

Aphid is among the Wolves who invade the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
. He manages to critically wound 
Erin
 after slashing her stomach when suddenly he is killed by 
Carol
, who then steals his clothing and writes a "W" on her head with blood to use as a disguise and easily kill the other Wolves.
