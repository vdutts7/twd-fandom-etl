Trivia






Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Afghanistan
[
]


Prior to the outbreak, Jenson was fighting in Afghanistan along with the rest of his squad which included a lot of members that would eventually become the 
Reapers
. Upon returning from war, he struggled to find jobs or deal with trauma, but the relationship between him and his comrades remained strong. He then decided to become a mercenary.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the beginning of the outbreak, as 
Operation Cobalt
 was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the 
undead
 threat, 
Pope
 and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as "the chosen ones". It is unknown if Jenson was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers, and either found or crafted his own mask with a decayed, walker-esque expression on it, and would use this mask as a scare tactic against those who were "marked" by Pope.



Tennessee
[
]


At some point, Jenson and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by 
Maggie Rhee
 despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group.



Season 11
[

"
Acheron: Part II
"
[
]


While not part of the 
Reapers
' initial attack on Maggie's group, Jenson, along with 
Michael Turner
, 
Leah Shaw
, and 
Brandon Carver
, remained hidden near the forest.



"
Hunted
"
[
]


Jenson accompanies the other Reapers in their attack on Maggie's group. During the fight, he comes up from behind 
Cole
 and slits his throat.



"
Rendition
"
[
]


While 
Daryl
 is being taken in for interrogation by 
Carver
 and 
Powell
, Jenson can be seen amongst his comrades within 
Meridian
. Jenson and another 
Reaper
 aren't present for Daryl's initiation or 
Bossie
's death, presumably due to keeping watch atop the Meridian wall.



"
For Blood
"
[
]


Jenson observes the 
horde
 from the top of 
Meridian
's perimeter wall.



"
No Other Way
"
[
]


Jenson is seen on a building rooftop armed with a sniper rifle, looking for the intruders in the streets below, as 
Gabriel
 secretly watches from afar as he sneaks through Meridian. During the standoff, Leah reveals that they have Jenson on the roof with a sniper. Jenson fires a warning shot. Leah tells Jenson to shoot Maggie, prompting Daryl to release Carver. An enraged Elijah begins walking towards Carver, and Leah yells at Jenson to fire. However, Gabriel is able to sneak onto the roof and kill Jenson, stealing his sniper rifle and using it to turn on the surviving Reapers, shooting Carver in the leg.
