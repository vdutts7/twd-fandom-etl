,,,"Lilly was a soft-spoken woman who looked out for the best interests of her family. She was seemingly oblivious to the grim realities of the outside world, and as such, lacked the necessary skills to survive.","Lilly worked as a nurse, having specialized in oncology. For years she had been married to a man with whom she had a daughter named Meghan . Three and a half years prior to the outbreak, her husband abandoned their family. Around the same time, Lilly's father, David , was diagnosed with terminal cancer.","During the initial stages of the outbreak, Lilly hid out with Meghan, David, and her younger sister, Tara , in her apartment complex. They relied primarily on one of the food trucks that David had driven for a living. For about a year the family spent their days in the apartment, relying on candles for lighting and making the most out of their circumstances. While Lilly continually watched over Meghan and the ailing David, Tara tried to clear their area of walkers, but didn't know they had to be shot in the head, so they kept getting back up. At some point, Meghan stopped talking, possibly from the horrors that she might have witnessed. The family played board games to try to make her feel better and get her talking again. Lilly is first seen in her apartment with Tara, Meghan, and David. She is immediately cautious of the stranger (The Governor, calling himself ""Brian Herriot""---a name he saw scrawled on the side of a barn during his travels before discovering the Chambler family) that knocks on their apartment door, and doesn't hesitate to collect his weapons after he relinquishes them to her. He has long hair and a scraggly beard and calls himself ""Brian"". Lilly offers ""Brian"" food and he returns the favour by getting the backgammon game from upstairs for her dad and Meghan. While upstairs, he finds a gun and keeps it. The next morning, Lilly comes in and tries to give his gun back, but ""Brian"" tells her to keep it because he saw she needed one. He also explains to her that they need to shoot walkers in the head to kill them. Lilly asks him to go to the nursing home a few blocks away and get oxygen tanks for her dad. He does and is almost killed. His head is injured and she tends to him. He bonds with Meghan. ""Brian"" is seen later sitting at their kitchen table, teaching Meghan how to play chess. All the while, he can't seem to take his eyes off Lilly. He has cut his scruffy beard and hair and his head wound has healed. David dies and because they have been hidden in the apartment for so long, Tara and Lilly do not realize that he will turn. ""Brian"" saved them by bashing David's head in with an oxygen tank. Lilly helps ""Brian"" bury her dad. After that, they all went on the road to find a better place. They pull the truck over for the night. After Meghan and Tara are asleep, Lilly and ""Brian"", after much sexual tension between them, make love in the van. The next morning, the van won't start and they have to walk. They run into walkers coming from a turn on the road. Tara falls and sprains her ankle. Lilly helps her up and the two stumble into the woods with ""Brian"" and Meghan. They get separated from ""Brian"" and Meghan in the woods, who fall into a walker pit. ""Brian"" kills them all with his bare hands. When it's over, he looks up and sees his old Woodbury lackey, Martinez , standing there. Lilly joins Martinez's camp after he finds Philip and her family in a forest near the camp. Lilly sets up a Nurse Station for the camp. She is convinced by Philip to leave the group with her family and Alisha . He told her that it's not safe there, but they return after they finding a group of walkers trapped in the mud outside of the camp. She is present when the group discusses about the camp's leadership after Martinez's death and when a walker sneaks inside the camp, grabbing Meghan's leg and almost killing her. Lilly is initially against Philip trying to take over the prison , but finally she seems to have accepted it reluctantly. In order to keep her and Meghan safe, Philip settles them along a river (which walkers cannot cross). When a walker attempts to cross the river, Lilly is alerted of it and is distracted away from Meghan calling her. Simultaneously, Meghan is playing with a puddle of mud, but is bitten on the shoulder by a walker buried in the mud. A terrified Lilly rushes down towards Meghan and kills the walker, but it is too late to save her. Later, during the final assault and subsequent destruction of the prison, Lilly arrives in a car, witnesses the beheading of Hershel Greene by the Governor with Michonne's katana , and distracts him from Hershel's corpse by presenting Meghan's, which she carries in her arms. Philip, seemingly shocked at the sight of the dead Meghan, drops Michonne's sword and walks to them numbly before taking her away from Lilly and disdainfully shooting her before the shocked and appalled Lilly in the head to prevent reanimation. As Lilly watches shocked, Phillip orders his men to ""Kill Them All."" Near the end of the fall of the prison, Michonne blindsides the Governor with her sword as he strangles Rick Grimes, impaling him from behind before leaving him to die or be set upon by walkers. However, a distraught Lilly walks over to the dying Governor and angrily dispatches him with a gunshot through the head from his own gun . After the attack is over and the prison survivors have escaped, Glenn finds Tara and she informs him that Lilly died in the prison attack after allowing herself to get swarmed by the herd overrunning the prison despite having a gun. Tara is clearly traumatized by her sister's death, particularly as Lilly wasn't supposed to be there in the first place and kept wondering why did she let herself die in a gruesome manner.","Killed By Zombies Despite having a gun, Lilly was swarmed and ultimately devoured by the herd that was overrunning the prison. It is unknown if she reanimated afterwards.",This list shows the victims Lilly has killed: Philip Blake Numerous counts of zombies,"For a more in-depth look at Lilly's relationships, read here: Lilly Chambler (TV Series)/Relationships",,"The casting call for this character used the name Laura . Lilly was described as ""A single mother and former nurse."" Lilly Chambler is based off of two separate characters from The Walking Dead comic universe , April Chalmers and Lilly Caul . Kirkman revealed that Lilly killed the Governor out of vengeance rather than pity. Lilly is the final character in the series to die at the prison. As her death wasn't confirmed until after the episode in which it happened, Lilly never received an ""In Memoriam"" tribute on Talking Dead . Lilly is one of seven non-main characters to cause the death of a main character by their own hand, the others being Caesar Martinez , Dawn Lerner an unnamed Whisperer , Dante , Bossie , and Montanio ."
