Overview
[
]


Boone is a ruthless, impassive, and brutal survivor. He generally seems quite unemotional and serious. Like the rest of the 
Reapers
, he is skilled in combat due to his military training and uses those skills to kill other survivors. When 
Maggie
 lets in a herd of walkers after ramming the Meridian gate, Boone, 
Fisher
, and 
Austin
 all help take down the herd with little problems. When 
Gabriel Stokes
 begins to fire at him with a sniper, Boone manages to dodge his shots and takes cover. Near the end of the battle with Maggie's group, Boone ends up being one of the last Reapers standing. During the standoff, after Gabriel kills 
Jenson
, the Reapers lose the upper-hand. When Leah tells Boone to give up his weapons, he is shown to be quite hesitant and reluctant but ultimately does so. Boone, Leah, and Washington are initially allowed to walk away peacefully. However, Maggie decides to go back on her deal, remembering all the people the Reapers have killed. Believing they are too dangerous to be left alive, Maggie takes out her gun and shoots Boone and the other Reapers. The deaths of Boone, 
Washington
, and 
Carver
 is what motivates 
Negan
 to leave, since he now sees that Maggie is not a woman of her word and could kill him too.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Afghanistan
[
]


Prior to the outbreak, Boone was fighting in Afghanistan along with the rest of his squad which included a lot of members that would eventually become the 
Reapers
. Upon returning from war, he struggled to find jobs or deal with trauma, but the relationship between him and his comrades remained strong. He then decided to become a mercenary.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the beginning of the outbreak, as 
Operation Cobalt
 was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the 
undead threat
, 
Pope
 and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as "the chosen ones". It is unknown if Boone was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers, and either found or crafted his own mask with a monochrome black-white pattern and a pair of fangs on it, and would use this mask as a scare tactic against those who were "marked" by Pope.



Tennessee
[
]


At some point, Boone and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by 
Maggie Rhee
 despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group.



Season 11
[
]


"
Acheron: Part II
"
[
]


Boone and at least a dozen Reapers appear on a dark road adorned on both sides with bodies hanging from posts. Suddenly, the Reapers open fire on 
Maggie
 and her group, killing 
Roy
 and severely injuring 
Cole
. As the 
Alexandrians
 flee into the woods, the Reapers chase after them.



"
Hunted
"
[
]


Chaos breaks out in the woods as Boone and the Reapers hunt down members of Maggie's group, killing Cole and injuring several others, including 
Duncan
, 
Negan
, 
Daryl
, and 
Gabriel
.



"
Rendition
"
[
]


While 
Daryl
 is being taken in for interrogation by 
Carver
 and 
Powell
, Boone can be seen amongst his comrades within 
Meridian
. Boone is present at Daryl's initiation, waiting outside with all the other Reapers for the inductee to pass the test. As Pope declares Daryl "forged by fire", Boone and the rest of the Reapers welcome Daryl with a latin mantra. He is later seen at a bonfire where the Reapers are eating dinner. He later watches in silence as Pope burns 
Bossie
 alive for presumed betrayal, claiming he allowed 
Michael
 to be killed in order to save himself.



"
For Blood
"
[
]


Boone is present when Pope and the rest of the Reapers are observing the herd. When Maggie lets in a herd of walkers, he helps clear them with 
Fisher
 and 
Austin
. Later, Gabriel begins shooting at Boone with a sniper but he manages to take cover. After 
Leah
 kills Pope and radios everyone that Daryl murdered their leader and is with the enemy, Boone arrives with 
Brandon Carver
 seconds after Daryl manages to escape. Leah instructs them to close the gates and kill everything inside the walls. Boone returns to the courtyard to help clear the herd until he is ordered to retreat.



"
No Other Way
"
[
]


Boone is seen with the remaining Reapers meeting with Maggie's group. Daryl offers to trade Carver while letting Leah and the others leaving peacefully. After Gabriel kills their 
sniper
, Leah takes the deal. However, a vengeful Maggie kills both Boone and Washington in cold blood as Leah manages to flee, only being grazed in the shoulder by a bullet.

Trivia
[
]


For an unknown reason, Boone is not mentioned in the 
Talking Dead
 memorial for "
No Other Way
".


In "No Other Way", Boone wields a weapon similar to the mace 
Rick Grimes
 uses in 
Season 9
.


In the episode "
For Blood
", Boone is seen down in the courtyard being shot at by 
Gabriel
. However, in the very next scene, after 
Leah
 radios that 
Pope
 is dead, Boone gets to the roof with 
Carver
 in a matter of seconds, only for him to be back in the courtyard again in the scene after that. This is most likely a filming oversight.
