Roman Calhoun,Fate,Contents,Overview[],Pre-Apocalypse[],Post-Apocalypse[],Death[],Killed Victims[],Relationships[],Appearances[]
,,,"Roman is shown to be a cold, cunning, cruel, unsympathetic, and dangerous man. He acts as one of 
Lance Hornsby
's spies and will carry out any task necessary under his orders, even if that means hurting and killing others, including children.
Upon his introduction, 
Eugene
 is immediately suspicious of him, believing him having to do with 
Stephanie
's disappearance. When Eugene interrogates him, Roman is shown to be quite irritated and impatient, trying to walk away from him. He shows no sympathy for Eugene, despite him being quite distressed. Roman tells a convincing story about how he was a plumber who was called in to fix a clogged sink. In the end, Eugene's suspicions are proven to be right, as it's revealed that Roman is part of Lance's shady group, and although he didn't kidnap Shira, is actually one of her fellow group members.
After this point, Roman becomes a recurring opposing force against the group, along with Shira. Lance orders Roman and Shira to go after 
Daryl
. However, Roman then sees a picture of Daryl's kids and decides to use them as hostages, showing he's even willing to go after innocent children. During the protests as the 
Commonwealth
 goes into lockdown, Roman spots 
Jerry
 with the children and proceeds to go after them, though they manage to get away.
Roman is also shown to be a remorseless killer, who has no qualms with killing innocent civilians if it is necessary. He along with Shira execute 10 innocent Commonwealth janitors to have them reanimate and cause chaos under Lance's orders, which leads to the deaths of many more people, including 
Pamela
's son, 
Sebastian Milton
. This action ends up getting him killed when Pamela has Roman executed and his body brought in to be fed on by the zombified Sebastian.",Nothing is known about Roman's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point during the outbreak, Roman joined a 
community
 in Ohio.
When 
Eugene
 heads to the Racine apartment building to search for 
Shira
, Calhoun exits through the front door, allowing Eugene inside. That night, Eugene is drunk and relieving himself up against a tractor in the Warehouse District when Calhoun walks by, promoting Eugene to stop and ask him questions. Calhoun remains patient and answers the drunken Eugene's questions and walks away before he can ask anymore. Since then, Calhoun has been secretly spied on by Eugene, with his daily schedule and routines carefully studied without his knowledge. One day, Calhoun went out on his usual 10 mile jog leaving his apartment empty and available for Eugene and Juanita to break into. They find a suitcase under his bed filled with weapons and are able to escape undetected when Calhoun cuts his run short due to rain and returns to his home. However, after an 
elderly neighbor
 alerts the 
Commonwealth Army
 of intruders in the building, Eugene and Juanita are arrested. Following his boss' orders, Calhoun does not press charges against the pair. On another night, Calhoun is gathered with his boss and fellow operatives when Eugene infiltrates their hideout but is captured. He and the other operatives proceed upstairs while Lance Hornsby speaks with Eugene.
Roman and 
Shira
 walk over 
Carol
's house trying to track down 
Daryl
, ordered by 
Lance
 to do so and capture him. However, Carol notices them and manages to hide the kids before they can find them. Roman and Shira enter the apartment and find it empty. They search around and Shira asks if Lance said anything else, but Roman says Daryl was the only name that came through.
Roman then sees a photo of Daryl with 
Judith
 and 
R.J.
 and takes it as a reference. Shira looks out the window and fails to notice Carol standing right next to it outside. As Roman looks at the photo, it's revealed the kids are hiding in a cabinet. Shira suggests they check the school and they leave.
Later, during the protests, as soldiers force everyone to go into lockdown, Roman spots 
Jerry
 and the kids amongst the crowd and informs Shira. Jerry asks some fellow Alexandrians and Hilltoppers to block their way to buy them time. Jerry and the kids climb up to a balcony and hide as Roman approaches. As Roman begins to leave, Jerry accidentally knocks some sticks onto him. Roman looks up the balcony but narrowly doesn't see them, before leaving to go look elsewhere.
Roman and Shira enter a gated off area where ten Commonwealth janitors are gathering. Without saying a word, Roman and Shira shoot and kill the ten with silenced pistols and then leave them to reanimate. The two later catch Lance's attention with a whistle and Shira gives Lance a salute, signifying the success of their mission.
Pamela Milton
 has Roman's body dragged into 
Lance
's cell, having had him 
executed
 for his role in 
Sebastian
's death. Providing the horrified Lance with a 
machete
, Pamela tells him that 
""the body's still warm. Feed my son, Lance,""
 wanting Lance to cut Roman up and feed him to the undead Sebastian.
In 
Lance
's cell, 
Daryl
 and 
Carol
 find the zombified Sebastian lying amidst Roman's dismembered remains. Daryl stabs Sebastian in the head, putting him down and leaving his corpse lying amongst Roman's remains.","Killed By
