We have to stay here, it's too late, you understand me? You stay behind me, and if we get separated, you just run somewhere safe and hide, you hear me? You go someplace safe and hide, and I will find you when this is all over. I will find you.

Overview
[
]


Although she only appeared in two episodes, Alisha appeared to be a somewhat kind person and was a strong, determined survivor. She quickly formed a strong relationship with Tara during the short time they knew each other and seemed to care about her deeply as shown during the attack on the Prison where she told her to run to safety if they were separated.

Alisha also appeared to be somewhat of a dark person who was more than willing to resort to extreme measures to stay alive and for her comrades to survive as well as she agreed with the 
Governor
's plans to take 
the prison
 by force despite the fact that it would most likely involve killing the Prison's inhabitants. She did not appear to be too fazed by 
Hershel
's violent death at the Governor's hands and quickly returned fire on Rick's group without any hesitation. She also did not agree with Tara's claim that fighting and killing was an unnecessary means of survival and followed the Governor's orders to assault the Prison and came close to killing 
Tyreese
 before meeting her own death, showing that Alisha was also very much capable of murder.



Pre-Apocalypse

Martinez
 and/or his other group members.

Content








"
Dead Weight
"


Whilst at Martinez' camp, Alisha starts a relationship with fellow survivor 
Tara Chambler
 and is later seen when the group discuss about the leadership after Martinez' death. She sets off with 
Philip Blake
 and the Chambler family when Philip convinces them to leave Martinez' camp for not being safe, but she comes back with them after that. Alisha is with Tara again, smoking a cigarette when 
Meghan
 comes up and tags Tara. Tara explains that she can't play tag with her when she hands over her gun to Alisha, tags Meghan and runs away. Alisha is also seen comforting Tara after a walker gets in the camp and almost kills 
Meghan
.



"
Too Far Gone
"


The Governor is first seen giving a speech to his group, convincing them to attack and take over the Prison for themselves. Alisha seems to agree with the plan. When they arrive at the Prison, she is seen, along with another guard, taking out 
Hershel Greene
 and 
Michonne Hawthorne
 from a vehicle. Alisha stands on the front line of The Governor's militia guarding Hershel while The Governor talks to 
Rick Grimes
. Once the shooting starts, after Hershel's head is cut off, she quickly starts firing back and hits Rick in the leg. She finds Tara terrified hiding behind a car who tells her that they should not be doing what they are doing, but Alisha disagrees, saying they need to. She then tells her to run off into the woods if they become separated. Alisha is then enters the 
prison
 grounds alongside another militia soldier, and starts advancing towards 
Tyreese Williams
, who is hiding behind potted plants to take cover. After the man behind her is shot, she turns around to see 
Lizzie Samuels
, aiming a gun at her. After a brief hesitation, Lizzie pulls the trigger protecting Tyreese, blowing a hole through Alisha's forehead and killing her instantly.
