,,Nothing is known about John's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, John somehow came into contact with a group named ""the Saviors"" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as a worker for the Sanctuary.
John is among the workers from the Sanctuary sent to 
Eugene
's 
outpost
 to help produce bullets for Negan's army.
John is producing bullets with the other workers when he listens to Eugene's speech about meeting the minimum quota for 
Simon
. When a soot-covered Eugene returns after his brief absence, John and the other Saviors are ordered to complete the entire bullet order in anticipation of Negan's final assault on the militia.
At some point following Rick's assumed death, the Sanctuary eventually falls as a community, with most of its residents integrating into 
Alexandria

the Kingdom
