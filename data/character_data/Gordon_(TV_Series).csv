,,,"Gordon is shown to loathe his time with the 
Saviors
 and has a great dislike of 
Negan
. After the death of his 
wife
, he began to realize that the life of a Savior wasn't worth it. One day he fled the 
Sanctuary
 to get away, but is later caught by 
Dwight
. Not wanting to go back, he asks Dwight to shoot him. Dwight coldly refuses and Gordon reluctantly forces himself to walk back to the Sanctuary. However, Dwight has a change of heart and shoots Gordon, granting his wish.","Nothing is known about Gordon's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he had a wife named 
Maria
.","During the early months of the apocalypse, Gordon and Maria were trying to survive on their own. Eventually, they were found by the 
Saviors
 and brought to live at the 
Sanctuary
. At some point later, Maria died and Gordon came to a realization that the Saviors' way of life is not worth it and thus would have rather wanted to leave them or die trying.
Gordon works in the garden taking care of the livestock and vegetables and kneels down with the others when 
Negan
 walks by. He stares at 
Dwight
 with a grim look on his face as he walks away, clearly unhappy with his life at the Sanctuary. Later that day, in an act of desperation, Gordon flees the Sanctuary, prompting Negan to send Dwight after him.
While on the run, Gordon is struggling with a lone walker when Dwight catches up with him. Holding him at gunpoint, Dwight forces Gordon to walk back to the Sanctuary as Gordon pleads to be let go, stating that anything would be better than going back to the Saviors. Ultimately, Dwight agrees to mercifully let Gordon go in a way and shoots him through the back. His reanimated corpse is then brought to the Saviors' base and incorporated into the walker perimeter around the Sanctuary.
While unseen, Gordon was among the chained walkers on the perimeter fence to have been blown up after the militia detonated an RV full of explosives at the Sanctuary in an attempt to have the Saviors' headquarters overrun.
