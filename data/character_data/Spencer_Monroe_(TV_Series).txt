“


I get what you're trying to do here... what you're trying to build. I'm not saying I agree with your methods, but I get it. You're building a network, and you're making people contribute to the greater good. Makes sense. But you should know that Rick Grimes has a history of not working well with others. (…) Rick wasn't the original leader here.... My 
mom
 was. She was doing a really good job of it. And then she died, not long after Rick showed up. Same with my 
brother
, same with my 
dad
. (…) 
His ego is out of control
. He'll find a way to screw things up, trying to do things his way. 
Trying to take over
. That's what he did with my mom, 
that's what he'll do again
. (…) I am my mother's son. I can be the leader she was... That's what this place needs... That's what 
you
 need.

Overview


Spencer is initially welcoming towards the 
group
. Due to living inside the walls of 
Alexandria
 for most of the apocalypse, Spencer is an inexperienced survivor. During the 
Wolves
' attack, he only manages to kill one wolf with a sniper rifle and misses the rest of his shots and when Morgan asks him if he'll join him in fighting the Wolves, Spencer just looked at him in hesitation.

Spencer proves to be selfish and hypocritical. He berates some Alexandrians for taking food from the food pantry, only to immediately take some for himself. It appears he wants to be useful to the community and tries to be brave, however his ideas usually end up causing more trouble. At one point, he tries to climb a grappling hook to a nearby tower in an attempt to draw away a herd, despite the idea being extremely unsafe. 
Rick
, 
Tara
, 
Tobin
, and 
Morgan
 are forced to save him. 

Despite his faults, Spencer does greatly care for his family. After the death of his 
brother
 and 
father
, he becomes greatly saddened, at one point becoming drunk and lashing out at 
Deanna
. Eventually Deanna herself dies which he also becomes distraught over. After her death, he still speaks highly of her leadership. However, overtime Spencer would take a darker turn. He grows a dislike for Rick, blaming him for the deaths of his family despite it not being his fault. At one point Spencer hoards weapons in his house, which Rick finds. He calls Spencer out, saying he got lucky with Alexandria and that he is a weak survivor. 

Spencer's hatred of Rick becomes greater and greater. While on the road with 
Gabriel
 he admits that he hates Rick and thinks he is a poor leader. Despite Gabriel's insistence that Rick is a good leader, Spencer doesn't listen. Spencer attempts to get 
Negan
 to kill Rick in an attempt to take over as leader of Alexandria. However, Negan calls out Spencer's cowardice of not taking over by himself, saying that he's got no "guts." This leads to Spencer's death when he is disemboweled by Negan.

Deanna
 as the one who had placed the rifle upon the lookout in the clock tower. He is later seen at the party where he meets 
Sasha Williams
 and tries to strike up conversation by talking about 
Shelly Neudermeyer
 and how she wants a pasta maker. However, Sasha turns him down and walks away. He later witnesses Sasha snapping at a women when she is overwhelmed by everyone and the general atmosphere.

"
Conquer

Spencer is on guard duty when 
Gabriel Stokes
, a priest and a newcomer with the Survivors, approaches the gate to leave for a "stroll" beyond the walls. When Gabriel returns later that night, Spencer asks if he could sometime come over and discuss his brother's death, as he claims he has nobody else to talk to. Spencer then asks Gabriel to close the gate as he gets ready for the community forum to discuss Rick's fate after his actions the night before with Pete. Once at the meeting, he listens to the townspeople and members of the Survivors speak about Rick. When Rick arrives with a dead zombie and informs the townspeople that it got through the walls, Spencer is quickly dispatched by his mother to check the gates after the people are notified that someone left the gate open.



Season 6


"
First Time Again
"


Spencer appears at the meeting in his house held by Rick to discuss how they are going to get rid of the massive horde zombies discovered in a nearby quarry, which is the main reason why the community has not been overrun this far into the outbreak. Rick assigns Spencer alongside 
Rosita Espinosa
 and 
Holly
 to be on watch duty in town while the Survivors goes to lure the zombies out of the quarry and away from the safe-zone. Spencer is at the armory with 
Olivia
, 
Tobin
, and 
Francine
 listening to 
Carter
's plan to overthrow Rick and his group. Carter tells Spencer that Deanna is barely a leader anymore due to the recent loss of her husband Reg. Rick walks in to find Carter holding a scared 
Eugene Porter
, who overheard the plotting, at gunpoint. Carter tells Rick that he's taking the town back. Rick asks Spencer if that's what he, Francine, Tobin, and Olivia all want, and Spencer says, "No, that's what he was talking about", which prompts Rick to disarm Carter and hold him at gunpoint. After a few tense moments, Rick decides to spare Carter and lowers the gun.



"
JSS
"


Spencer first appears in this episode in the watch tower of Alexandria. He witnesses 
the Wolves
, a hostile group of survivors that runs through communities, killing their inhabitants and taking their supplies, swarming the town and killing several people. He attempts to snipe several members of the Wolves, but only manages to kill one of them due to his inaccuracy with the rifle. Disappointed, he attempts to snipe more of the Wolves until he notices a truck heading straight for Alexandria. To prevent massive destruction, he takes aim at the truck and fires several bullets before managing to kill the driver, which brings the truck crashing into a wall instead of through the front gates. This is also triggers the horn of the truck to blare, attracting the half of the herd of walkers, which the Survivors are concurrently leading from the quarry, toward Alexandria. Spencer quickly runs down the tower to the truck in an attempt to stop the noise. He reaches the truck and prepares to kill the Wolf member that has reanimated before 
Morgan Jones
, who was sent by Rick back to the community, comes along and kills it. Spencer informs Morgan of the attack on Alexandria from the Wolves. Morgan tells Spencer to stay on watch which he does. Spencer meets up with his mother and 
Maggie Greene
, his mother's assistant. Spencer and Deanna embrace. Maggie tells Spencer and Deanna that she is going to help the others while Spencer stays to watch his mother. Spencer helps Deanna into the truck to keep her safe. Spencer is later seen with the other surviving Alexandrians patrolling the walls. Spencer asks Rosita if this is what life outside the walls is like, to which she replies, "Pretty much." Spencer also asks how Rosita is able to live in the face of such despair. She explains that her friends give her something worth dying for.



"
Now
"


Spencer first appears listening to Rick, who has returned to the community but brought along with him the half of the herd that had broken away from the rest due to the horn, discuss that they will lure the zombies away from Alexandria, and that they will wait for 
Glenn Rhee
, 
Nicholas
, 
Abraham Ford
, Sasha, and 
Daryl Dixon
 to return to Alexandria.

Later that day Spencer is at the food pantry with 
Kent
, 
Anna
, 
Barbara
, 
Bruce
, and Olivia. Olivia tells the Alexandrians that they need to start rationing the food as they do not know when they will be able to leave for runs. Bruce insists that his family and the other Alexandrians need the food, since they will likely be dead soon anyway, but Spencer speaks up and says that they need to save the food. Bruce talks back to Spencer and reminds him to make sure to close the front gate. Spencer reminds Bruce and the others that he killed the truck driver that was heading straight for Alexandria that was aiming to destroy the walls and that, without him, they would not be standing there. Spencer also tells the others to think about the other Alexandrians that need food as well. The Alexandrians consider Spencer's words and put back their excess food. Deanna looks on in pride of her son's actions.

At their home, Deanna comes down to the kitchen to find Spencer drunk with stolen food from the food pantry. Deanna asks why he took the food when before he was against taking it and he simply says that he wanted it for himself. Deanna reprimands Spencer for his actions and he harshly criticizes her, stating that it was her fault that Aiden and Reg died, and for giving everyone a false sense of security. Shocked at Spencer's words, Deanna walks away with Spencer looking on remorsefully. Spencer is later seen relieving Rosita on guard duty watching the herd. Right before she leaves, Rosita compliments Spencer on taking out the truck driver and saving Alexandria. Spencer overlooks the walker herd while eating chips from the food pantry that he took earlier.



"
Heads Up
"


As Rick and Tobin work on strengthening the wall, they look up to see Spencer climbing along a grappling rope over the herd and towards the decaying bell tower. Rick calls for him to return to safety, while 
Tara Chambler
 urges him forward. The grappling hook starts to come loose, nearly causing Spencer to lose his grip; by now, he is closer to the tower, and Rick urges him to continue forward to safety. However, the rope detaches from the hook, sending Spencer falling into the midst of the herd against the wall. Tara, Rick, Tobin and later Morgan all help to save Spencer from the herd and pull him back up to safety with the loose rope.

As Spencer rests on the lookout, Rick reprimands him for his improvised attempt, with Spencer replying that he was only trying to help, revealing his plan to climb over the herd in order to reach a car to use to draw the walkers away. Rick angrily orders Spencer to consult him before acting on any plans he makes in the future; Spencer challenges him, asking if he would have listened regardless.

Spencer is later mentioned during Rick's conversation with Deanna, the latter of who is grateful for the former saving his life.



"
No Way Out
"


As the group is separated due to hundreds of walkers flooding into Alexandria, Spencer is found in the infirmary with Heath and Aaron watching Rick carrying an unconscious Carl. He helps Denise with tending to Carl's eye injury and later helps fight walkers to save Alexandria. He is later seen with the remaining survivors resting outside of Denise's clinic after the bloody and tiring battle against the mega walker herd.



"
The Next World
"


Spencer walks into the woods with a shovel. Michonne follows him. Spencer tries to draw a walker out of the nearby brush and as the walker emerges, Michonne appears and kills it. She then asks Spencer why he is in the woods. Spencer explains that he takes walks after his shifts and starts to head off alone again. Michonne insists on going with him. She explains that his mother Deanna told her to figure out what she wants in life, and for now, she just wants to figure out why he's wandering around in the woods with a shovel. Michonne and Spencer catch a glimpse of Carl as he races away, leaving a walker behind. Spencer unsheathes his knife as Michonne recognizes the walker: It's Deanna. Michonne restrains Deanna as Spencer tearfully stabs her through the head. He explains this is the reason he's been walking in the woods. Afterward, Spencer digs a grave and mourns the loss of his entire family. Michonne assures him that he still has a family with his friends in Alexandria.



"
Twice as Far
"


Spencer first appears laying in bed after Rosita gets up. The two are implied to be in a relationship. The next day, Spencer asks Rosita to dinner and she reluctantly agrees to it.



"
Last Day on Earth
"


Spencer appears when Rick and the others are leaving to take Maggie to the Hilltop. He asks Rick if it's too late to make a deal with the Saviors if they come to Alexandria, Rick confidently tells him to make the Saviors wait for him and that he's "got a deal for them".



Season 7


"
The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
"


Spencer appears in Rick's dream sequence of everyone having dinner.



"
Service
"


Spencer and Rosita drive up to the gate, preparing to leave for a supply run. Spencer asks Eugene if he would like to help until 
Negan Smith
 arrives with a large group of Saviors and demands to be let in. Spencer approaches the gate and asks who Negan is, who is frustrated due to making such a 'strong first impression'.

Dwight
 confiscates Spencer and Rosita's guns before ordering them to bring back Daryl's motorcycle. They leave Alexandria.

Out in the woods, Spencer and Rosita find Daryl's motorcycle by the tracks where he had previously hidden it. As Spencer loads the motorcycle into the van, he begins to question Rick's leadership.

Spencer tracks Rosita down after she has killed the Saviors present at Denise’s death and chastises her. Rosita tells him that she's looking for guns on the assumption that Negan will confiscate all the guns in Alexandria and that they don't have to live this way.

Back in Alexandria after the Saviors leave, Rick calls out Spencer for hoarding supplies saying that he is small, weak and that he has got lucky. Spencer says they should've made a deal with Negan when they had the chance; he then blames Rick for Glenn and Abraham's deaths. Rick threatens to break Spencer's jaw and knock his teeth out if he says anything like that again.

Rosita confronts Spencer about the hidden guns and asks why he didn't mention them. "You saw what I did to get one," she says. Spencer explains that he hid the guns for a while because he didn't trust Rick and he was worried about Rick being in charge. He muses that Rosita was correct; they don't have to live like they are.



"
Sing Me a Song
"


Spencer and Gabriel drive up to the gates to find Rosita and Eugene preparing to leave. Spencer warns Rosita that they must produce for the Saviors as part of their new "tax." He reminds her it was Rick that got them into this. Rosita asks if he thinks he can do better, to which he says yes. She chastises him and tells him to leave her alone before leaving with Eugene.

Out on the road, Spencer asks Gabriel if it is a sin to hate someone. Gabriel tells him it is not, and Spencer confesses that he hates Rick. He says he is a bad leader and hopes he doesn't return from his supply run. A shocked Gabriel asks him to stop the car. He calls Spencer a "tremendous shit", but says he doesn't have to be eternally. He gets out of the car and starts walking back to Alexandria alone. Spencer hears a walker nearby and runs into the woods, where he finds a walker stuck in a hunter's tree stand.

Spencer lassos a compound bow from the walker in the tree. The walker falls to the ground. Spencer searches its pockets and finds a note written in Latin.

Spencer returns to Alexandria at the same time as Rosita and Eugene. In the car, there is a bounty of supplies and weapons. He explains that he found a note describing a list of caches. He plans to give them over to the Saviors and also plans to do "much more". He whistles towards the gate and a Savior opens it. They realize that Negan is in Alexandria.



"
Hearts Still Beating
"


Spencer watches as a Savior rummages through the goods that he collected. He commends his hard work as 
Laura
 sidles up to Spencer and offers to show him their compound if he plays his cards right.

At home, Spencer looks at the mess Rick made after he ransacked the house to find the guns he had hidden. He dresses up in nice clothes and rehearses his greeting in front of a mirror. He grabs a bottle of liquor and heads outside.

Spencer is walking down the street and Rosita calls out to him, asking if he has a hot date. He approaches her and reveals that he's planning to get close to Negan so he can strike against him at some point in the future. He asks her about their relationship and why she ended it. Rosita admits she used him and apologizes. Spencer asks her to dinner and Rosita agrees to join him.

Spencer walks to Rick's house and introduces himself to Negan. They share a drink on the porch as Negan pines for a pool table. Spencer points to the house across the street and tells him there is one in the garage.

As Spencer and Negan play pool in the middle of the street, residents gather around to watch. Spencer tells Negan that Rick's ego is out of control and proposes that Negan appoint Spencer the new leader of Alexandria. Negan considers Spencer's betrayal. He points out that Rick is swallowing his hatred to gather goods for Negan so he won't kill anyone else. "That takes guts," he says. Negan wonders why Spencer doesn't just kill Rick himself instead of sneaking around as Spencer begins to stutter. "It's because you've got no guts," Negan says as he plunges a knife into Spencer's abdomen, disemboweling him. Spencer falls to the ground, holding his intestines in his hands as the residents watch in horror.

After the Saviors leave, Spencer reanimates. Rick angrily stabs him in the head.



Death

While playing pool, Spencer tells Negan that Rick isn't fit to be the leader and that he should be killed. Negan then proceeds to talk about how Rick is out gathering supplies so that he won't hurt anyone while Spencer has waited until Rick was gone so he could talk to him and tell him to do his dirty work, and that he has no guts. 

Immediately, Negan pulls out a knife and guts Spencer open. Spencer, still alive falls to the ground and tries to hold all of his organs but falls down and dies of blood loss.

Quotes


The following is a list of some of Spencer's most memorable quotes.





Season 5




"Trying to make a getaway, huh? I can pretend I didn't make it. (…) I'm Spencer. Deanna's my mom. (…) Well, if you want to hang with me, I'll make sure you don't get stuck with Mrs. Neudermyer. She really, really likes talking about how much she wants a pasta maker. It's not a conversation you want to have."
- Spencer to Sasha at the party, "
Forget
"





"Think we could find some time to talk later? About Aiden. Just some things I need to say and I'm not sure who I can say them to. I don't really have anyone here right now, if you know what I mean."
- Spencer asking Gabriel if he can talk with him about the death of Aiden, "
Conquer
"





"I asked Gabriel to close it."
- Spencer to Deanna about the walkers getting in, "
Conquer
"





Season 6




"That's what he was talking about."
- Spencer to Rick about Carter's plan to take the place from him, "
First Time Again
"





"Someone, a group, they got inside the walls. They're 
killing
 people."
- Spencer to Morgan about the Wolves, "
JSS
"





"Hey, 
hey!
 Stop! Right now! Stop it! This stuff is for everyone. We need to make it last if we're gonna survive. (…) Yeah. That was me. I did that. But that truck outside the walls, it'd be inside if it wasn't for me. I did that too. If I didn't, maybe we wouldn't be talking right now. Where were you, Bruce? Doing this will start us down the road or nothing matters. Where no one else matters. And then we'll all look back at this moment right now as when we destroy this place."
- Spencer to the Alexandrians as they take food from the pantry, "
Now
"





"No. If they all went in and raided the pantry and everyone knew it, saw it, then that would be the end. But one person? One person, and no one ever know. So, why not me? I stopped that little run at the bank. I deserve a 
reward.
 One last celebration. Because they were right, mom, and you know it. We're all gonna be 
dead
 real soon. (…) Me? Now that is some 
bullshit!
 You're the reason we're so 
screwed!
 You made us this way! We were never safe here! But you didn't want to see that, you didn't want 
us
 to see that! You just wanted to 
dream!
 What happened to dad, to Aiden? 
That's all you!
"
- Spencer blaming Deanna for Reg and Aiden's deaths, "
Now
"





"Lost a damn shoe..."
- Spencer after Rick, Tara, Tobin, and Morgan save him from walkers, "
Heads Up
"





"I was trying to help. I wanted to get to a car, draw them away. (…) Would you listen to me?"
- Spencer as Rick confronts him for his idiotic plan, "
Heads Up
"





 
 
 
 
 
"You got a life back there and maybe I will too, but before I can even think about that, I need to take care of something. I have to 
try.
"
 
 


"My family's dead. That's not 
home
, it's just where I live. (…) Hey, enough. I'm fine. You got a life back there and maybe I will too, but before I can even think about that, I need to take care of something. I have to 
try.
"
- Spencer to Michonne as he searches for a zombified Deanna, "
The Next World
"





"So that's why I was out here."
- Spencer to Michonne after putting down a zombified Deanna, "
The Next World
"





Season 7




"Look, I know this sucks, but you saw what happened. You saw how many of them are there today. That's it. It's 
over
. This is our life now. This is where Rick got us. Maybe if Rick thought it through, it would've been different. People might still be with us."
- Spencer to Rosita about the Saviors and Rick's leadership, "
Service
"





"We should've made a 
deal
 with them when we could've! Oh yeah, we're so 
lucky!
 You led us all to the Promised Land isn't that right, Rick? Here we are! I guess Glenn and Abraham were lucky too?"
- Spencer to Rick about the Saviors taking over, "
Service
"





"Hating somebody, is that a sin? (…) I hate Rick. He was a cop, fine. He shouldn't be in charge. My mother, she-- she served in Congress, she led people, she brought out the good in people. 
("Rick brought out the good in me.")
 How? By 
bullying
 you? (…) He didn't keep everybody alive, Gabriel. My mother, my father, my brother. (…) He got here, they 
died
. (…) Or maybe we shouldn't have attacked that Outpost--! (…) What future? There's no future with him in charge. The thing I can't stop thinking is that... maybe the only good thing that can happen for us now... is 
he never makes it back.
"
- Spencer revealing his hatred of Rick to Gabriel, "
Sing Me a Song
"





"I'm on a good momentum with them, gonna try and use that. (…) By trying to get closer. Even just to start trying, if I can do that, after a while, maybe months, maybe years, maybe then we try something. Think it's what my mom would've done, so it's what I'm gonna do."
- Spencer to Rosita as he goes to talk to Negan, "
Hearts Still Beating
"





 
 
 
 
 
"Would you be up for dinner later? Really, it's just dinner. No strings."
 
 


"Whatever it was, thought we had something good. At least the beginning of something good. Why'd you 
end
 it? Why'd you even 
start
 it? (…) Would you be up for dinner later? Really, it's just dinner. No strings."
- Spencer asking Rosita about their relationship, "
Hearts Still Beating
"





 
 
 
 
 
"I get what you're trying to do here... what you're trying to build. I'm not saying I agree with your methods, but I get it."
 
 


"That's actually what I came to see you about. I came to talk to you about Rick. (…) I get what you're trying to do here... what you're trying to build. I'm not saying I agree with your methods, but I get it. You're building a network, and you're making people contribute to the greater good. Makes sense. But you should know that Rick Grimes has a history of not working well with others. (…) Rick wasn't the original leader here.... My mom was. She was doing a really good job of it. And then she died, not long after Rick showed up. Same with my brother, same with my dad. (…) Doesn't matter. 
His ego is out of control
. He'll find a way to screw things up, trying to do things his way. 
Trying to take over
. That's what he did with my mom, 
that's what he'll do again
. (…) I am my mother's son. I can be the leader she was... That's what this place needs... That's what 
you
 need. (…) We'd be much better off."
- Spencer to Negan about Rick, "
Hearts Still Beating
"





"What? No, no, I didn't-- I don't--"
- Spencer as Negan confronts him about his cowardice, also his last words, "
Hearts Still Beating
"

Spencer is the only member of his family to directly kill another human.


Spencer is the second member of his family to later become a 
walker
, the first being his mother 
Deanna
.


Spencer was originally planned to appear in the episode "
Start to Finish
", but the scene was cut from the final product.
[1]


It is revealed in the episode "
Sing Me a Song
" that Spencer knows Latin.


It is possible that Spencer has religious beliefs or theistic ideals as he confides in 
Gabriel
 his thoughts and feelings like an adherent of Christianity would with a priest during confession.


Spencer is the fifth series regular to die while being credited under "Also Starring", the first being

Although the two of them never met, there were a number of similarities between Spencer and Shane.
