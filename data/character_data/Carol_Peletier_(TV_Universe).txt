Overview
[
]


At the outset of the series, Carol is introverted and soft-spoken, though often meek and defenseless, particularly when it comes to facing her abusive husband, 
Ed
. She remains fiercely protective over her daughter 
Sophia
, attempting to shield her from the various dangers of their surroundings. After Ed is beaten half to death, Carol rebels against her husband's wishes for Sophia to spend time with him and begins to participate in group activities alone with their daughter. Due to Ed's loss, Carol slowly begins to empower herself. After Sophia's death, she begins to stand up for herself and gains more independence, while strengthening her bonds with the group. She is shown during the second season to be a devout 
Christian
, frequently praying for the well-being of herself and Sophia. She fervently holds onto her 
Beliefs
 even after Sophia's death, insisting that her daughter is in heaven.

Starting in the third season and more prominently in the fourth season, Carol later obtains a proactive and pragmatic stance when she secretly kills two sick members of the group in an attempt to prevent a deadly disease from spreading and shows little remorse over the deed, claiming that it was necessary. 
Rick
 deems Carol's actions morally questionable and exiles her. When 
Lizzie
's psychotic tendencies escalate to the extent of killing her younger sister, 
Mika
, Carol feels obligated to kill her in order to protect her group: herself, 
Tyreese Williams
, and Rick's daughter 
Judith
. Later, Carol confesses to Tyreese, the boyfriend of 
Karen
 (one of the two ill members she kills) that she is responsible for the deaths and gains Tyreese's forgiveness. The difficult choices Carol makes to stay alive leave her emotionally wounded as a result. In the fifth season, her resourcefulness is exemplified when she wipes out of the cannibalistic death compound, 
Terminus
, where the other survivors are held captive, saving them all from potential death. Doing so, she regains the respect and praise of Rick. Despite her initial hesitation to rejoin the newly established group permanently, she eventually welcomes the idea, she and is seen as a leader during the group's separation on their journey to Washington, D.C. Carol is revealed to be 
agnostic
 by the fifth season, revealing that she is no longer sure if she believes in God or an afterlife.

Carol's development has revealed her to be highly intelligent, cunning, objective, and resourceful, serving as a reliable confidant and counselor to Rick, typically advising the most cerebral and analytical approach. She is not afraid to take matters into her own hands and is shown to be prepared to kill anyone whom she views as a threat. She is also a brilliant liar, as she is able to convince the entire town of Alexandria that she is a meek, incompetent older lady in an attempt to mask her much more savvy and skeptical personality. She still retains her sanity and her emotions of sympathy, but Carol will always take the logical route at any cost. Carol is occasionally shown to be extremely cold and cruel, as shown when she threatens to leave 
Sam
 for the Walkers if he tells of her presence in the gun gallery and coldly telling him to move on after his abusive 
father
's death. She also threatens and attempts to kill fellow group member 
Morgan Jones
 for getting in her way of killing 
Owen
, the leader of 
the Wolves
, despite the latter being confined and restrained. Carol is shown to be similar to Rick in the sense that both are unwilling to take chances when it comes to dealing with human threats and show an enthusiastic desire to kill them without hesitation.

Starting in the back half of the sixth season, it is shown that she does feel remorse for killing people, writing down a list of the peoples she has killed as she begins to feel the weight of her actions since the apocalypse began. Deep down Carol desperately wants to believe what Morgan believes, but the facts haven't lined up like that for her. She's a hardened combat veteran but born out of necessity and reluctance. Around this time, she also confesses to considering herself the "mother" to all of the survivors and is able to do terrible things while maintaining her motherly side, to protect them. Her motherly side is shown in her threatening 
Pete Anderson
 for harming his family, as well as her refusal to let 
Maggie
 do anything dangerous, such as help in the assault on the Saviors while she is pregnant, going such lengths as to stick around to make sure Maggie doesn't slip away to protect her.

Despite her remorse in killing other survivors, Carol is still very much capable of committing 
murder
 to keep herself and those she cares about safe from danger as shown when she kills an entire group of Saviors that kidnapped herself and Maggie and coldly guns down a 
member
 that nearly slashed the pregnant Maggie in the stomach with a knife. Following this, Carol chooses to exile herself from her group claiming she can no longer kill any more human threats. Carol, however, has not weakened in any way as she single-handedly takes down another small group of Saviors herself after they refused to surrender. In the season six finale, it seems like Carol is accepting her fate just like when she is nearly killed by the Savior who had survived her attack.

After being rescued by Morgan and allowing herself to recover from her wounds at the Kingdom, Carol is still adamant about isolating herself from the world and hence leaves to live in a small house on the Kingdom's outskirts. Morgan and leader of the Kingdom, Ezekiel occasionally check up on her much to her annoyance. In her solitary life, Carol continues to believe in avoiding involvement in violent confrontation as she immediately rejected Richard's - Ezekiel's head of security - plea to incite war with the Saviors. However, after hearing from Morgan about the deaths of 
Glenn Rhee
 and 
Abraham Ford
 at the hands of 
Negan Smith
, Carol returns to the Kingdom and tells Ezekiel they need to get ready to fight against The Saviors, which was shown when she gunned down members of the Scavengers and the Saviors without hesitation when helping to save Alexandria. 

By Season 10, Carol is shown to be utterly devastated over the death of her adopted son Henry and as a result is shown to be consumed by anger, rage and a desire for vengeance and also shows signs of mental instability. She wants to personally kill Alpha, her son's killer at all costs and exterminate the Whisperers completely and is angered and disgusted at her group's unwillingness to fight back and their desire to respect Alpha's territorial boundaries to avoid further conflict. She appears to not be concerned at the potential consequences of her actions as seen when she recklessly attempts to shoot Alpha after the latter mocks her over Henry's death, appearing not to realize or care that the Whisperers could unleash their mega-horde of Walkers upon all the communities in an instant and appears to just want Alpha dead regardless. She is dedicated to learning of the Whisperer's horde's location to remove their chief weapon and give the communities a chance to fight back and personally and brutally tortures a 
captured Whisperer
 to learn it, exemplifying her desperation to kill Alpha. Her desire for vengeance also causes her to put personal relationships she has in jeopardy to benefit her mission of killing Alpha, namely with Lydia whom she lies to and attempts to use to turn the Whisperers against Alpha (due to her lying to her people that she murdered Lydia). This greatly upsets Lydia after 
Mary
, Alpha's third-in-command, learns of her survival and she calls Carol out for using her. For this, Lydia claims Carol is just like Alpha herself, much to her shock. However, the two women eventually reconcile.

Despite Daryl's best attempts to convince Carol to let go of her vendetta against Alpha, it is apparent Carol's desire for revenge has completely overclouded her common sense and adept strategic thinking as she is lured into a trap by Alpha alongside many of her allies in a cave containing the Whisperer's mega-horde, supposedly making Alpha the first adversary to be capable of outsmarting her. However, Carol is shown to have had a secret plan in the works the whole time, having secretly formed an alliance with Negan whom she had released from prison so that Negan could infiltrate the Whisperers and kill Alpha. After Negan kills Alpha and delivers Carol her foe's severed zombified head, Carol is shown to be satisfied with her revenge despite having not killed Alpha personally, which causes her friendship with Daryl to strain, as he blames her for Connie getting trapped in the cave. He tells her to run and that he won't stop her this time. Carol shows 
remorse
 for how far she went to get revenge, but Connie's sister 
Kelly
 forgives Carol, believing that Connie is still alive out there somewhere and expresses understanding for Carol's actions.

In "
The Tower
", Kelly realizes that Carol thinks that the way that she is is a weakness. However, Kelly has heard the stories of Carol's actions in the old days, 
"that you... you'd just go off. And do the thing that only you can do. Lone wolf."
 Rather than considering it to be a weakness, Kelly calls it Carol's superpower, like Kelly's own growing hearing loss, and she tells Carol that Carol can't give up everything about herself just because bad things happen.

By Season 11, Carol is no longer consumed by anger, hatred or rage and even shows great remorse for her actions as she begs 
Aaron
 not to journey down the vengeful path she followed during the Whisperer War after Henry was killed, as killing Alpha did not bring her peace. Carol even acknowledges her reckless actions, like getting Connie and her friends hurt, something that is shown to haunt her. As a result, she helped Aaron alternatively choose forgiveness with 
Keith
, that choice resulted in a way to fix the damage her original mistake caused, since Keith provided Carol with Connie’s last known location. After helping to rescue Connie from 
the Ferals
, Carol is shown to be relieved and pleased by Connie's apparent lack of anger towards her with Connie even volunteering to help Carol during a 
bad storm
.

After moving to 
the Commonwealth
, Carol is shown to enjoy a simpler life, although she makes a deal with 
Lance Hornsby
 to help him in his shadier activities in exchange for Lance getting Ezekiel treatment for his cancer. Carol also appears to have patched things up with Daryl following Connie's rescue, even affectionately teasing him over the visible attraction between Daryl and Connie and planning to have lunch with him before 
Sebastian
's actions interrupt their plans. During this time, Carol grows closer with her ex-husband Ezekiel again, although it's currently unclear if they will resume a romantic relationship.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Douglas County, Georgia
[
]


Carol lives in the outskirts of Atlanta, where she eventually met a man named 
Ed Peletier
. He was initially charming enough for her to date and eventually marry. However, his true abusive nature would be revealed throughout the course of their marriage. She was a housewife, and she fiercely looked after their daughter, 
Sophia
, by nurturing and providing her with comfort while Ed consistently neglected her. Throughout their marriage, Carol and her daughter were victims of verbal and physical abuse. Because of her restrained independence, she remained hesitant to inform any outsiders of the situation.

Despite the abuse, Carol chose to stay married because she used to think that her idea of happiness was not being alone. An intoxicated Ed would hit her often, where several times would end with her shoulder dislocated. She learned how to heal it via the internet, due to being too embarrassed of having to return to the hospital, only to make the excuse that she had fallen down the stairs. One day, Carol decided to cut off all of her hair because when she tried to run away from Ed, he would grab her hair and slam her head against the wall. She once took Sophia to a shelter in Atlanta in an attempt to get away from Ed, but after a day and a half, they went back to him. After they went back, Ed beat them both severely.



Post-Apocalypse
[

Metro-
Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


During the onset of the outbreak, Carol and her family traveled towards a supposedly safe zone in Atlanta. On the way, they got caught in a traffic jam and befriended 
Shane
, 
Lori
, and 
Carl
. While on the road, Carol tried to give some food to Carl, but Ed stopped her, saying that they would not have enough for themselves. Sometime after the city was napalmed by the military, they formed a campsite outside the outskirts of Atlanta, along with other survivors.

"
Tell It to the Frogs
"


Carol, together with Sophia and Ed, is first seen watching Rick and the others coming out from the truck from their mission at Atlanta. At night, when the survivors are resting around dimly lit campfires, Ed attempts to make his fire bigger, stating that it's cold. 
Shane
 asks him to put it out, stating that the light and smoke may attract any walkers lurking around. Ed finally gives in and orders Carol to dim the fire to embers. The next morning, Carol is cleaning 
Rick Grimes
' clothes for him, stating that was the best she could do, especially without a real washing machine, and Rick thanks her.

Later, Carol is doing laundry at the quarry with 
Andrea
, 
Amy
, and 
Jacqui
, joking about what they missed. When Andrea says that she missed her vibrator, Carol looks at her husband, then back at the women, and whispers "Me, too," prompting laughter to explode from the women. The laughter draws Ed over, who orders them to stop and do the laundry. Andrea, fed up with Ed's attitude, says that if Ed doesn't like the way laundry's done, he could do it himself, tossing his clothes at him. Ed throws it back at Andrea roughly, starting up an argument. Ed demands for Carol to come with him. Jacqui then makes a remark to Ed, proving that she and everyone else knew how Ed abused her in private. Carol is then submissive to Ed, but Andrea tells Carol that she didn't have to go. Carol then begins to resist, to which Ed responds with a slap to her face, drawing blood from her lip. Andrea and Jacqui, both upset, push Ed away as Amy holds Carol in her arms. Shane, who was observing the situation from a distance, is enraged with what he has just witnessed. He approaches Ed and beats him senseless, threatening him to not ever lay a violent hand on his wife or daughter or that next time, he wouldn't stop hitting. Carol is upset from the beating and tended to her husband, weeping and apologizing.



"
Vatos
"


Carol is seen sewing some clothes while Andrea and Amy return from fishing. She is then present for the confrontation with 
Jim
, standing with Sophia and 
Carl
, with her arms around them. She remains shy and hesitant to speak when Jim resorts to openly expressing how Shane shouldn't have interfered with her and Ed's personal issues, stating that it was their marriage and thus their own business to sort out with each other. Carol and Sophia later give Ed some water in the family tent, and Carol invites Ed to come outside with everyone. He rejects her invitation and tries to force his daughter to stay and keep him company. Carol, visibly concerned about Sophia and managing to finally stand her ground, saying "Ed, she wants to join in," and brings the girl outside. Carol eats fish at night with the rest of the survivors and is intrigued by the conversation about 
Dale Horvath
's watch. Moments later, when zombies descend upon their camp, she grabs Sophia, shields her, and flees to the RV with some of the other survivors as the zombies invade the camp, killing Ed, Amy, and several others.



"
Wildfire
"


The next morning, Carol takes care of Sophia while the men dispose of the zombie corpses, and tries her best to reassure her about their current situation. As 
Daryl Dixon
 goes through each zombie with a 
pickaxe
, she stops him when he gets to her dead husband. She proceeds to stab her husband multiple times, initially in a hesitant but then furious manner, venting out the anger that she had kept inside of her for many years. She later attended the funeral for her husband, Amy, and the other fallen survivors. While the others figured out what to do next, she took care of a bitten Jim in the RV and noticed his deteriorating physical health. Before departing the base camp, 
Morales
 and 
Miranda
 broke the news that they were not going with them, but instead to Birmingham to find their extended family. She shares a goodbye hug with Miranda and Morales before they leave. Carol, Sophia, and the remaining survivors reach the 
Center for Disease Control
 and were about to flee as zombies begun to approach their location, but the doors suddenly opened, drowning all of them in light.



"
TS-19
"


The group is admitted into the 
CDC
 by 
Edwin Jenner
 after going through a blood test to ensure none of them were infected. Carol is introduced to the luxuries the facility has to offer, including hot water and real beds. She is able to live in a comfortable room with Sophia and notes the wonderful feeling of sleeping in a real bed for the first time in months. She enjoys dinner and wine with everyone and learns about TS-19 and Dr. Jenner's work, and the fall of the CDC's infrastructure. After Dr. Jenner revealed the purpose of the countdown timer and locked the control room's door, she was hysterical and pleaded with Edwin to let them go, explaining how inhumane it was for him to be keeping them locked inside there, and that Sophia deserved a better death than this. As the survivors finally get Edwin to open the door for their escape, they all reach the lobby to find the doors permanently locked and the windows bulletproof. Just as all hope is diminished, she approaches Rick and takes a grenade out of her purse, telling him that she found it in his uniform the day he arrived at camp, and she washed the clothes. Rick uses the grenade to break the glass, successfully escaping the CDC. She reaches the RV just in time and she drives off with the group away from the complex as the ruins burn in flames.





Season 2

"
What Lies Ahead
"


Dale's RV breaks down on the way to Fort Benning, forcing the survivors to stop in the middle of the road. While searching other cars on the roadside, a 
herd
 of walkers catches the group by surprise. Sophia, while her horrified mother watches helplessly, is chased into the woods, and Rick goes to lead the walkers away. When her daughter disappears, the others head out to look for her. They find an abandoned church, where Carol stops to pray for her daughter's safety.



"
Bloodletting
"


As they continue to look for Sophia, the group were found by 
Maggie Greene
, who turned up on horseback to retrieve 
Lori
. Maggie takes Lori to her home and gives the others the location of the 
Greene family farm
, telling them to find their way there. They make it back to the highway, but Carol doesn't want to go to the farm without Sophia. Dale, Andrea, T-Dog, and Daryl decided to stay with Carol and see if Sophia comes back, 
Glenn
 and 
T-Dog
, meanwhile, head to the farm to seek aide for T-Dog's infection.



"
Save the Last One
"


Carol stays behind at Dale's RV, hoping to find Sophia. Upon hearing Carol's crying in the middle of the night, Daryl and Andrea go back out into the forest to search for Carol's daughter but return without her. The next day, they leave a sign and food for Sophia at the highway, and Carol consents to go with the remainder of the group to look for Hershel's farm.



"
Cherokee Rose
"


After leaving some food on the highway for Sophia, Carol and the others head to Hershel's Farm. She is then seen setting up tents with the other survivors and cleaning the RV, in the hopes that it would look good when Sophia returns. Likely, she had also done this in an attempt to keep busy and distract herself from her fear of what had happened to Sophia. When Daryl returns, he gives Carol a Cherokee rose to give her hope that they would find Sophia and bring her back safely.



"
Chupacabra
"


The episode begins in a flashback and shows a number of survivors (including Carol, Ed, Sophia, Lori, Carl, and Shane) on the highway outside Atlanta in the hopes of finding refuge. When Carl asks for food, Carol offers to get him some; but when she attempts to do so, Ed pushes the door shut. He yells at his wife, telling her they wouldn't have enough for the two of them if she "keep[s] running [her] damn mouth off" to everyone they meet. Her efforts having been rejected, Carol instead pulls some food out of her purse and offers it to Carl, but Lori, who had seen the confrontation, declines. In the present, Carol is seen doing laundry with Lori and comments that it would be nice to cook in a real kitchen again, and she offered the idea to cook for 
Hershel
 and his family that night. The offer having been accepted by the other members of the household, Lori and Carol are welcomed into Hershel's house and cook dinner with the help of 
Patricia
 and 
Beth
. Towards the end of the episode, Carol brings dinner to an injured Daryl and gives him a kiss on the forehead, stating that by risking his life to find her daughter he has done more for Sophia than her own father did in his whole life.



"
Secrets
"


Carol appears standing behind Patricia, looking out into the forest. Later, when Shane and Andrea come back from their search for Sophia, she helps Andrea clean off.



"
Pretty Much Dead Already
"


Carol is first seen cooking a meal for the rest of the group. When Glenn tells them that the barn was full of walkers, she joins the group as they go to investigate. Later on, she tries to stop Daryl from going out looking for her daughter, Sophia, because he was still healing. He throws the saddle to the floor and walks away, insulting her in his frustration. Sometime after that, they both are seen walking along a river, where he finds another Cherokee Rose. He apologized for the earlier incident and said that they will find Sophia. Carol answered that he's right and that she can feel it. Later, Shane broke open Hershel's barn doors and a swarm of zombies poured out. After the group killed them all in self-defense, labored breathing was heard and one last walker comes out of the clearing cloud of dust, Sophia. Carol was beyond devastated and, sobbing, ran toward her, but Daryl caught her. Rick walked up from the back of the group and shot Sophia in the head.



"
Nebraska
"


Carol refuses to attend Sophia's funeral, claiming that the dead walker was no longer her daughter, which angers Daryl. Back at the barn, Shane is washing up at a water pump when Carol emerges from the forest, muddy and scratched. Shane cleaned her cuts and apologized for what happened to Sophia and claimed that if he knew she was in the barn, he wasn't sure what he would have done; but he assured Carol that he was only trying to ensure the safety of his fellow survivors.



"
Triggerfinger
"


Back at Hershel's farm, Daryl tells Carol that Lori had asked him to find Hershel, but he had refused. He speculates that Lori went on her own to town. Carol starts to leave, but turns around and asked Daryl not to pull away like this. He doesn't respond. Later that night, Carol went back to check on Daryl, finding many dead squirrels, dead rabbits, and the necklace of severed walker ears hanging on a clothesline. Daryl catches her and confronts her about coming to look for him again. This explodes into a full-on rant on Daryl's side, to which Carol quietly told him to "Go ahead." Carol lets Daryl vent his frustration on her (showing an enviable amount of emotional strength, or perhaps the fact that she had become accustomed to this sort of thing with Ed), while still not backing down and holding her ground. Daryl reaches his boiling point and screams that Sophia wasn't his daughter and blamed Carol for not keeping an eye on her. He moved forward in an aggressive way, and Carol instinctively flinches away. Daryl pulled away, realizing what he had done, and stared at Carol without saying a word. The next day, Daryl finally returns to the folds of the group by entering the house during a group discussion and gave Carol an apologetic smile, which she returned.



"
Judge, Jury, Executioner
"


Carl is kneeling by 
Sophia
's grave when Carol approaches. She reassures him that they'll see Sophia in heaven, one day. Carl snapped back that heaven is just a lie, "And if you believe it, you're an idiot". Carol approaches Lori and Rick, telling them that they needed to control Carl for being disrespectful towards her. Lori unknowingly tells Carol to calm down and Carol takes it personally, telling Lori that she just lost her daughter days ago and that she hadn't lost her mind. During the group meeting, Carol says she wants the fighting to stop and for them to just make a decision about Randall. Dale retorts back saying, "Not saying anything or killing him yourself... there's no difference." Carol is seen with the other survivors gathering around a dying Dale before the injured man is shot by Daryl both out of mercy and to prevent reanimation.



"
Better Angels
"


Carol is seen with the group when they were preparing to move into Hershel's home, and again when Rick and the group investigated the barn after Randall's disappearance. Rick stated that the handcuffs were still locked and that he could have slipped them. Carol asks if it was possible and is answered with "It is if you've got nothing to lose."



"
Beside the Dying Fire
"


When the herd of walkers advance on the farm, Lori is horrified to discover that Carl is missing. Carol reassures her that they won't leave without him and that she would help look for Carl. When they were unable to find him, Carol assumes that he snuck out and went looking for Rick to help find 
Randall
. When Lori wants to go looking in the woods for Carl, Carol convinces her that they needed to leave the farm instead, as it had become overrun. Lori reluctantly agreed and told Carol to get Beth and 
Patricia
. She did so and the four women ran from the house. Carol runs ahead of the other women in the confusion and got separated. As Carol runs, she is cornered against the shed by a couple of walkers. 
Andrea
 came to her rescue, but Carol soon lost track of her. As the rest of the survivors fled the farm, Carol was left behind and was chased by 
walkers
. Daryl, who had been watching the chaos, heard Carol's screams and came to her rescue, picking her up on his motorcycle and narrowly avoiding a group of walkers in the process.

In the morning, Daryl and Carol were riding away from the overrun farm, dodging walkers along the dirt road as they go. They eventually met up with the rest of the survivors on the 
highway
. Carol was happy to discover that Carl was still alive and was reunited with his mother. Carol showed concern for Andrea when she did not show up with the others.

When the group stopped on the side of the road, Carol worrys for the group's safety when they decided to stay the night. She becomes angry at Rick when he revealed that everyone is infected and had known so since they had been at the CDC. Later that night, she expressed her concerns to Daryl, telling him that she felt unsafe with Rick. Carol told him that he deserved better than to be Rick's henchman. When Daryl asked her what she wants, she responded with "a man of honor". Daryl brushed her off, claiming "Rick's got honor." When the group heard a noise in the woods, Carol said that they should go and tells Rick to "do something" to which Daryl responded harshly.

"
Seed
"


Seven to eight months following the events of the preceding season, Carol has gone through a significant transformation. She was shown to be increasingly proficient with weapons and was taking a more active role within the group, such as when it came to securing the prison. In addition, her self-confidence had grown and she seemed to have moved on from mourning her daughter. The relationship between her and Daryl had also become closer and more personal, with the two of them casually joking around and assisting each other with various things. There was also the hint that she might have been harboring romantic feelings for him now, although that is up to interpretation. Her trust in Rick has been regained, to the point where she believed that within the past few months, Rick had done more to keep the group alive than Shane ever did.

She and Lori had strengthened their bond as well, with Carol helping her through her pregnancy and providing her with reassurance. The two had shared a cell together since settling into the prison.



"
Sick
"


Carol was mostly seen in this episode helping the other survivors take care of Hershel as he had given her some medical advice prior to being bitten. Carol asked Glenn for a favor which involved helping her kill a female walker so she could practice performing a C-Section. She wanted to do this both because she thought she may have to be the one to deliver Lori's baby due to Hershel's current condition and because Lori had needed one when she had Carl. Carol was seen about to cut into the stomach as she was being watched from afar by 
Andrew
, who was believed to be deceased.



"
Killer Within
"


Walkers invaded the prison, separating the group. Carol and T-Dog were one of the groups that were separated from the others. While locking up one of the gates to ensure no more Walkers get into their safe haven, T-Dog was bitten on the shoulder from behind by a quickly advancing Walker. He insisted on getting Carol somewhere safe inside of the prison rather than sitting down and waiting for his time to run out. Once they got to the end of a hall, two Walkers blocked their escape and they have no where else to go. Since he had already been bitten and would turn anyway, T-Dog heroically charged the two zombies, holding them back and sacrificing his life to allow Carol to escape. After the situation at the prison is controlled, Daryl and Rick found her headscarf and revolver left behind next to T-Dog's devoured body, and they assumed her to be dead. While they did not find any other evidence to support this, they probably assumed she had been devoured as well.



"
Hounded
"


Finding Carol's knife jabbed in the throat of a walker, Daryl broke down in grief, still believing Carol to be dead. Overcome with sadness and anger at his loss, Daryl began stabbing the ground with her knife, but was distracted by a rocking door. He angrily pulled it open assuming he will find a walker, but he found Carol, weak and dehydrated, inside. Daryl picked her up and carried her back to the group.



"
When the Dead Come Knocking
"


Daryl took Carol back to the safety of her cell to recover. He presumably got her some water and called Rick, who was questioning the recently arrived Michonne, over.

Having previously believed Carol to be dead, Rick was overcome with stunned relief upon seeing her. They shared a friendly, emotional hug, along with some of the other survivors. When Carol saw the baby, she was overjoyed, but, when she noticed that Lori is not there, she realized that Lori had died in the birth and was devastated. She grasped Rick, broke down, and apologized, blaming herself for not being there to help with the birth. They both consoled each other. Later on, Carol was seen holding baby 
Judith
 while bidding Daryl farewell as he left for 
Woodbury
. 



"
Made to Suffer
"


Carol observed 
Axel
 complimenting Beth on caring well for Judith (Rick and Lori's baby) and asking for her age, and she took it as Axel making a move on her. She pulled him aside and orders him to leave Beth alone and not make any advances on her (as she was seventeen years old and he was a full-grown adult). Axel offered as a rebuttal that there are few women around who could satisfy him, because Maggie was in a relationship with Glenn, and he assumed Carol to be a lesbian due to her short hairstyle (a stereotype often attributed to lesbian women). When she informed him that she wasn't, he dubbed their conversation "interesting," to which Carol replied, "no it's not," and walks away.

Later, when Beth questioned Hershel about Carol and Axel's location, when she heard voices in the prison, Hershel replied that it couldn't have been them, as they were together in the guard tower keeping watch.



"
The Suicide King
"


Carol began talking with Carl about Lori while they waited for Rick and the others to come back from their trip to Woodbury. When they eventually came back, Carol frantically looked in the car and became worried when she can't find Daryl. She questioned Daryl's whereabouts and Rick told her that Daryl is still alive, but he left the group so that he could be with Merle again. Carol was shocked and in a state of disbelief, asking Rick many times if Daryl was actually gone and how he could possibly leave the group. Later, when she was preparing a crib made out of a cardboard box for Judith to sleep in, Beth walked up to her and began talking to her about Daryl's departure from the group and also about Judith. Carol tells Beth that Sophia, her daughter, used to wake the neighbors and how Ed, her now deceased husband, used to sleep at a friends house. Carol also told Beth how men like Ed, as well as Merle, got into people's heads and made them feel like they deserve the pain and abuse they give them. Beth mentioned how angry she was at Daryl for leaving the group for Merle, but Carol said not to be because Daryl had codes and that they needed more men like that in this world. She seemed to be at ease with Daryl leaving, despite initially being crestfallen. 



"
Home
"


Carol and Axel were seen erecting barriers around The Prison in preparation for an impending attack from 
The Governor
 and Woodbury. During this time, Carol and Axel began to bond, as Axel informs her of how he ended up in prison for "armed robbery" due to a misunderstanding. Because of their time together, Axel now saw Carol as a friend and approached her again later on in the episode. While Carol was talking with Axel outside, he is shot and killed by The Governor, starting a battle between The Prison group and The Governor's group. Carol then quickly ducked down and uses Axel's body as a shield in order to protect herself from the crossfire. Maggie quickly rushed outside and provided Carol, Beth, and Carl with weapons that they then used to defend themselves.



"
I Ain't a Judas
"


In the episode, Carol walked into Daryl's cell and talked with him about Merle. Carol told him how she's glad he came back for them and that she thought Merle wasn't. good company for Daryl and that he was only bringing him down. She told Daryl to look how far he'd come without Merle in his life and that he was a better man without Merle. Later, when Andrea arrived at the prison, as soon as she saw Carol, they embraced each other and Carol told about how, once Andrea saved her, they thought a walker killed Andrea back at the farm in "Beside the Dying Fire". Later on, Andrea came up to Carol so that she could see Lori's baby. Carol told Andrea that the baby's real name was Judith and Daryl gave her nickname "Little Ass Kicker". As she was talking with Andrea and catching up, Carol suggests to Andrea that she end the whole Prison-Woodbury conflict. Carol suggested that Andrea should sleep with The Governor, give him the best night of his life, then, while his guard was down, kill him in order to end it. Carol influenced Andrea enough so that she thought about it, and when she was back in Woodbury, she slept with The Governor.  Afterward, as The Governor was asleep, she walked up to The Governor with a knife and was going to kill him. However, she realized that she couldn't do it, so she put her knife down and walked away.



"
Arrow on the Doorpost
"


Carol only appears very briefly in this episode. Carol is first seen when she begins to open the gates for Rick and the others, who are returning from their meeting with The Governor. She is not seen inside until Rick gathers them, which implies that she was outside, keeping watch, while Merle and Glenn were fighting inside. When Rick gathers everyone, Carol is seen listening carefully to what Rick has to say, and when Hershel walks outside to talk with Rick, he mentions that he and Carol believe that they should leave the Prison behind and take their chances out on the road rather than take the risk of losing the prison and being killed by The Governor, but that they would go along with whatever Rick thought would be best for the group.



"
This Sorrowful Life
"


As Merle is walking around the upper level of the Prison, Carol calls to him from the common room downstairs. She asks if he is with them. When Merle says yes, Carol believes he doesn't understand what she is asking of him; she adds that she does not mean if he is living in the same place with them, but if he is on their side, and tells him he needs to choose. Merle replies that he's on Daryl's side, and Carol says that Daryl's with them. Merle goes on to say that Carol is no longer who she was back at the Atlanta camp: A mouse afraid of her own shadow. Carol replies that that was her husband's shadow she was afraid of, not hers. Merle then leaves an aggravated Carol behind.

Later on in the episode, Carol is seen sitting around with the rest of the group in the prison-yard, holding Judith in her arms. She listens to Rick reveal his plan to give Michonne to The Governor (and how he decided to pull back on said plan) and inform everyone that he is stepping down as leader. Carol does not say anything, but looks on in astonishment.



"
Welcome to the Tombs
"


Carol is first seen helping the group loading supplies, clothes, and belongings in the cars so they could leave the prison if necessary. While doing so, she comforts Daryl, who was grieving over the loss of his brother. Carol had decided stay in the prison with the rest of the survivors when the Woodbury army attacked. Meanwhile Carl, Hershel, Beth, and Judith would remain outside in the woods. During the attack, Carol fires against the Woodbury soldiers as they fled the prison in fear. As Rick, Daryl, and Michonne leave to go after the fleeing Woodbury survivors, Carol is one of the survivors who stay in case The Governor returned for another attack. She helps clear the gates of walkers when Rick's team leaves. When they come back, Carol, sad to see Andrea hasn't returned with them, helps unload the cars and goes back to the prison.

"


Carol is first seen with Rick, Tyreese, and Daryl, examining the bodies of Karen and David. When Rick and Tyreese get into a fist fight, Carol tries to break them up. Carol is later seen talking to the group about isolating the Infected in Cell Block A. Later, she is holding the door for the infected walking in. As she closes it, Lizzie walks in and tells Carol she isn't feeling well. Lizzie begins to cry, and Carol comforts her, and assures her that she'll be fine. Lizzie asks Carol if she could tuck her in. Carol, not wanting to stay exposed to the virus, tells her that Glenn can tuck her in, saying he is the "best" at tucking kids in. Much later in the episode, Tyreese visits to Carol at the kitchen area and asks her to watch over Sasha since she has a natural mother instinct. Carol apologizes about Karen. After Tyreese leaves, she begins to cry and dumps some of the water. Afterwards she heads to the fences to pump water, knowing many walkers are nearby. She is close to being bit, but Rick comes to her aid. At the end of the episode, Rick confronts Carol and asks her how much she cares for everyone and how much she'd give.

"
Indifference
"


Carol goes with Rick on a medical supply hunt for Hershel after the others do not return. They meet a couple named 
Ana
 and 
Sam
 and they ask Rick if they can go with them to the prison. Carol speaks in favor of them. After splitting up, they are in a house and Carol explains to Rick she did what she did because she believed everyone else would have gotten sick and died. Outside while finding food, Rick asks Carol why she never talks about Sophia, and Carol explains that she is dead. Later on while heading to the safe house, they find Ana's dead body, to which Carol has no surprising reaction to. They wait for Sam to return but he never does, and they assume he either is dead or he left. They head to the car and Rick makes a decision to banish Carol from the group. He insists that Karen and David might have lived regardless of their illness, and that killing them was not Carol's decision to make alone. To avoid having Tyreese kill Carol, the possibility of others not wanting her at the prison, and Rick not wanting her around his children, he gives her gas and other supplies and sends her on her way in another vehicle. Before they say their goodbyes, Carol gives Rick a watch that Ed gave her on their first anniversary, and then she leaves.



"
Inmates
"


Carol returns in this episode, saving Lizzie, Mika and Judith from walkers after Tyreese goes to investigate the sound of nearby screaming. She and the three children go to find Tyreese.

"
The Grove
"


On their way to 
Terminus
, the group is seen sleeping on the tracks one night, where Carol is tending to Judith and talking with Lizzie. Carol later mentions her daughter Sophia, before telling Lizzie to go to sleep. In the morning, the group is on the move, and Carol and Tyreese smell smoke in the air. Carol takes Mika with her to find supplies nearby, and Tyreese stays back with Lizzie and Judith. Carol attempts to convince Mika that people need to kill other people sometimes in order to survive, but Mika insists she can kill walkers but won't kill people because it's wrong. Carol says Mika will die if she doesn't change. During this trip, a walker approaches Tyreese, Lizzie and Judith, but its leg falls into a hole in the tracks. Tyreese approaches it to attempt to kill it, but is stopped by Lizzie, when she tells him that they don't always have to be killed. 

Meanwhile, Carol and Mika stumble across a pecan grove with a house on the property. They backtrack to get the rest of the group before entering the house. Tyreese and Carol leave the girls outside with Judith while they clear the house. Suddenly, a walker emerges from a side door, prompting Mika to shoot it, alerting Tyreese and Carol. Lizzie is visibly upset with Mika killing the walker. Later that evening, the group is in the house. Carol and Lizzie are at the table cracking pecans, and Mika finds a doll upstairs to play with. During this time, Tyreese takes a moment to look around at the unusual sight of being able to sit in a living-room. Mika simply tells him to relax, and that they could stay there forever.

The next morning, Carol starts the teapot, only to look out the window and see Lizzie playing with a walker. Carol immediately runs outside and kills it, while Lizzie vehemently protests. Carol later takes Mika out to go deer hunting, but she is unable to shoot a deer due to her personal vendetta against killing. Carol and Tyreese are seen later getting water from the well, in which Tyreese tells her that he's not ready to be around people yet, and that he trusts her as a person. 

During this time Mika runs outside the house to find Lizzie, and spots her rounding the yard. Lizzie can be seen feeding a mouse to the walker who had fallen on the railroad tracks toward the beginning of the episode. Mika catches up with her, and tells her that they're not alive, and that they're bad. Lizzie insists that she can hear them talking. During their argument, burned walkers begin emerging from the forest, and the two girls run back to the house, screaming for Carol. 

Carol and Tyreese hear their cries when they get back to the yard, and begin shooting the walkers that are chasing after the girls. Lizzie and Mika join in the shooting. Later that night, Carol asks Lizzie if she understands walkers now, and Lizzie says that she does. She cooks pecans with Lizzie and Mika, and mentions that she used to bake them with her grandmother when she was little.

The next morning, Tyreese and Carol are out hunting, and Tyreese begins talking about Karen, and telling Carol that he sees her in his sleep, haunting him. Carol tells him that people who are dead probably exist there to remind you of what once was. Upon returning to the house, Carol and Tyreese stumble upon a horrific sight. Lizzie has killed Mika with her knife, firmly believing that she would come back to life. Carol reaches for Lizzie's knife, but Lizzie pulls her gun, and tells Carol that they need to wait. Lizzie also mentions that she planned to kill Judith, but Carol convinces her to give her the gun, and to go with Tyreese back inside the house, creating the ruse that she will tie up Mika. Lizzie agrees and returns to the house with Tyreese and Judith, while Carol is suggested to kill Mika before reanimation. Later on, Tyreese and Carol make the revelation that Judith is not safe around Lizzie, and Lizzie can't be around other people. The decision regarding Lizzie is silently unanimous: she had to be executed. 

Later on, Carol takes Lizzie out under the ruse of gathering flowers for Mika. Lizzie gets the sense that Carol is mad at her, but is convinced that Carol's anger is because Lizzie pointed a gun at her earlier. Crying, Lizzie turns away, and Carol tells Lizzie to look at the flowers as she shoots her in the back of the head. Tyreese watches the execution from the kitchen window of the house, and they bury the two girls together in the yard. Later that night, Carol hands her revolver to Tyreese and confesses to Tyreese that she was the one to kill Karen and David at the prison. After Tyreese learns that Karen's killing was quick and that she was unaware of what was happening to her, he forgives Carol. The two leave the house in the morning with Judith, continuing on their way to Terminus.

"
No Sanctuary
"


While traveling with Tyreese and Judith, Carol tells Tyreese that she will make sure that him and Judith are safe inside Terminus, but that she will not stay there. They then see a walker come out of the woods, which Tyreese refuses to kill because of his emotional instability. Carol does it and realizes that a herd is coming through the woods. They hide from the herd, but the herd is distracted by the sound of gunshots coming from the direction of Terminus. The trio dodges the herd and finds another track that leads east on the other side of Terminus. They then get the drop on 
Martin
 (a Terminus resident) setting up charges to distract any potential walkers from the sound of the gunshots. When they overhear him mention Michonne and Carl, it becomes clear that Rick's group is being held at his base and is in danger. Carol and Tyreese tie up Martin, and she leaves Judith with Tyreese and heads out to the compound to rescue her friends on her own. She smears herself in walker blood to sneak in with the herd that they encountered, which is approaching the complex.

Upon reaching Terminus, she infiltrates the complex by exploding the large propane tank by the gates by using a high powered military rifle and bottle rocket, taking down part of the fences. She then sneaks in with the herd. This distraction gives Rick, Daryl, Glenn and Bob the opportunity they need to escape from the butchers, who are about to slaughter them for meat. As she makes her way through Terminus, Carol shoots several Terminus snipers who are firing at the herd. While searching through the buildings, Carol happens upon a room where the captives' possessions are held. She spots Daryl's crossbow and finds the watch that Rick had given to 
Sam
 (
Season 4
, episode "
Indifference
"), who was also being held at Terminus. Carol then enters the ritual room, where she is cornered by 
Mary
. Carol manages to fight her off, asking Mary where Rick and the others were. When Mary doesn't answer, Carol shoots her in the leg, crippling her. Mary tells Carol that Terminus was a sanctuary at one point, but changed into a complex where they lured people in, in order to take their possessions and be used as a food source. Carol is disgusted by Mary's immoral delusions and opens the door to the outside, allowing several walkers in to devour the crippled Mary. Carol then leaves, the walkers leaving her alone due to still believing Carol to be one of them.

As the facility is overrun, Carol makes it back to the woods and encounters the group. Daryl, Rick, and the rest of the survivors are stunned and have an emotional reunion with her. Daryl is overcome with emotion and runs to Carol hugging her and crying because he was so happy to have her back.  Upon realizing that Carol set the events at Terminus in motion, Rick is overwhelmed with gratitude. Rick, Carl, and Sasha are further overjoyed when she leads the group back to the cabin where Tyreese is with Judith. Tyreese admits to Carol that he'd been forced to kill Martin, after Martin had threatened to kill Judith.



"
Strangers
"


Carol can be first seen at a creek with Tyreese, filling water bottles. Tyreese tells her that he talked to the rest, and that everyone knew what she did at the prison, and that they were okay with it. Both she and Tyreese seem still scarred about the events with the girls during their trek towards Terminus. Tyreese expresses he doesn't want to tell the others about what happened. She's later seen talking with Rick, and he's expressing his gratitude towards her and he owes her everything. Rick seems to be apologetic about banishing her, but she tells him he did it so she can survive. He tells Carol he's with her all the way, and asks her "Will you have us?" and she nods her head yes. She then can be seen with Daryl, at nighttime on guard, saying that she doesn't want to talk about what happened. He respects her wishes on not to speak about it and leaves it alone. She and Daryl then hear a noise, but don't discover what the noise is. Daryl the next day can be heard talking to Rick about his suspicion that someone was watching them the night before. Carol then helps the group kill some walkers attacking Gabriel, who is pleading for help. Gabriel takes the group back to his church and several group members search his it. Carol is amongst them, and finds Gabriel's writings on his desk, referring to the Bible and the divine word of God.

Later, Carol can be seen with Daryl getting gallon jugs of water and rigging up a car for travel. Daryl tells Carol that she can go back to the way things were, to which Carol seems reluctant. Daryl offers to help Carol carry her water and ends up accidentally throwing a jug of water at her feet.  Carol smiles for the first time in a long time.  During Abraham's speech at the church about survivors, Carol is seen to be looking intently at the door and seems to be planning to leave. She soon disappears, only to be discovered by Daryl at the car that they rigged up earlier. Daryl asks what she's doing, and she says that she doesn't know. He tells her to come on with him back to the church.  They then see another car pass by in the dark, and Daryl recognizes it immediately as the same car that took Beth. He smashes the tail lights out on the car and tells Carol to get in. The two drive off in pursuit of the car.



"
Slabtown
"


Carol appears briefly at the end of the episode. She has been rendered unconscious after being hit by a station wagon, driven by 2 officers at 
Grady Memorial Hospital
 in an attempted rescue mission for 
Beth
. Shocked, Beth witnesses her being brought in on a stretcher, very soon after the events of "
Consumed
".



"
Consumed
"


Carol and Daryl drive on in pursuit of the mysterious car until their vehicle runs out of gas. They spend the night in an abandoned women's shelter where Carol and Sophia once stayed to temporarily escape from 
Ed
's abuse. Nearby noise leads them to a pair of walkers - a mother and child - trapped in one of the other rooms. Carol moves to kill them but Daryl insists that it isn't necessary. 

The next morning Carol sees Daryl outside cremating the mother and child, and she goes out to thank him. They leave and scout the area, spotting in the distance a white cargo van hanging off the side of a highway - marked with the same white crosses that were on the other vehicles Daryl encountered. They are soon ambushed by 
Noah
, who steals their weapons and flees. Carol draws her hidden revolver and tries to shoot him in the leg, but Daryl stops her, much to her anger. She reveals that she left the church due to not wanting to see anyone else die. Daryl is angry because she said she was with him and trying, reminding her that they are both in this together.  

They move on to investigate the white van, finding nothing but a stretcher from Grady Memorial Hospital, which gives them their first solid lead. They are quickly surrounded by walkers, forcing them to escape by riding the van over the edge and onto the ground below, holding hands as they go. Carol sustains a few injuries, leaving her with a limp. Having both survived relatively unharmed, the two head up another office building to scope out the hospital. Up to this point of the episode the pair has been discussing their respective journeys and why they need to keep surviving despite all the horrors they have been through. 

Noise from elsewhere in the building leads them back to Noah fighting off some walkers and fleeing once again. Daryl chases him, and Carol catches up to find Noah trapped beneath a book shelf with a walker trying to get at him from the unblocked doorway. Carol begs Daryl to save him, and after some reluctance Daryl kills the walker and helps to free Noah, who tells them of Beth and their recent escape from the hospital. They flee when a white-cross car approaches, but Noah collapses on his injured leg and Daryl stays back to help him. Carol runs ahead and is accidentally struck by the white-cross car seen earlier, knocking her unconscious. Daryl is frantic to get to Carol, but Noah- promising that she will get proper medical treatment and that she and Beth can be rescued- convinces Daryl to stay back, and they watch as Officers 
O'Donnell
 and 
Alvarado
 place her on a stretcher and into the car before speeding off.

Throughout the episode, several flashbacks convey some of Carol's experiences after being 
banished by Rick
: the first one shows her taking shelter in a 
law firm
 in Griffin, Georgia for an evening before she notices the smoke rising from the nearby prison, prompting her to drive over and discover the settlement in ruins. She is next seen burying Mika and Lizzie's bodies at the pecan grove and then looking up at the sky to see the plume of smoke seen originally in "
The Grove
". The next one shows her watching the bodies of Karen and David burn. The last flashback shows her alone in the immediate aftermath of the Terminus breakout, cleaning herself off from her walker camouflage-disguise and then walking away.

Carol is seen briefly at the start of the episode, still unconscious from the car incident, when Beth is examining her from the door, and 
Steven Edwards
 checks on her.

Rick tells Michonne that he has to go as he reminds her that he owes Carol everything. She is then mentioned by Officer O'Donnell, who is suggesting turning off the machines that are keeping Carol alive and letting her pull through herself, saying they "can't keep wasting valuable resources".

Carol is seen again, briefly, towards the end of the episode, when Beth successfully completed her plan to get Carol drugs, "Epinephrine", as told by Steven would save her life. Beth administers the epinephrine and waits for Carol to wake up, holding her hand and looking down in anguish. "I just wanted you to know I was here," Beth says, in a way to comfort both her and Carol. Carol, however, remains unconscious for the rest of the episode.

Carol is first seen sitting on the road with others waiting for Daryl, Maggie and Sasha. When the truck ran out of gas, Carol is seen walking on the side of the road with rest of the group. When Daryl leaves to hunt/forage, Carol goes with him and comforts him over all that they have lost and gently kissing him on the forehead.  As they keep moving on and find some cars, Daryl decides to circle back and Carol suggests going with him, but he refuses. While sitting on the road 4 dogs come out of nearby bushes, but Sasha kills them. Later when the group spotted the bottles of water, Carol pointed out that the water might have been poisoned, but they hear thunder and lightning and they all enjoy the rain until they feel a tornado coming and headed to the barn that Daryl found earlier. While they were clearing the barn she says to Maggie that some people don't give up just like them. Carol is later seen sitting next to the fire, she comments that Carl keeps bouncing back and listens to Rick's story. 



"
The Distance
"


When 
Aaron
 is being interrogated by Rick, Carol looks in irritation as Aaron avoids a question. She later helps tie Aaron up after Rick knocks him unconscious. She rides in the RV during the night, arriving at the flare which Eric fired unharmed and happily embraces Rick and Michonne. She then rides the RV arriving at the safe zone with the others and tells Rick "
even though you were wrong, you were right.
"



"
Remember
"


Carol enters the Alexandria Safe Zone with the rest of her group and is individually interviewed by 
Deanna Monroe
. During the interview, Carol pretends to come off as weak, stating that she was a housewife who only did the laundry and gardening before the apocalypse and always prepared dinner for her "stupid, wonderful" husband. She goes on to say that she was happy her group accepted her, stating that she felt like a den mother who is always protected, purposefully leaving out details of the events she endured and her transformation into a strong survivor. She expresses that she is a people person and wants to join a junior league to help others. After everyone is interviewed, she is the last to hand over her weapons to 
Olivia
, struggling to remove her rifle and placing it in the bin, further displaying her "weakness". As the group begins to settle in their house, she and Carl go to their other house next door to explore. Inside the empty house, she takes a notepad that she uses to doodle as seen that night. The next day, Carol receives her assignment as a caretaker to cook for senior citizens and busy mothers, having changed her appearance to well-groomed in a blouse, cardigan, and khaki dress pants. The night after the confrontation at the town gates, Carol emerges from the house onto the porch and speaks with Daryl and Rick on the porch, discussing that they can get comfortable but not weak.



"
Forget
"


Carol is first seen outside the walls, plotting with Rick and Daryl to steal guns. When a walker comes along, she empties her clip into it to give the illusion they had gone shooting. She is seen exchanging cooking tips with other women before excusing herself to talk to Rick, telling him she can handle stealing the guns herself. She heads to the storage house and asks Olivia for cooking supplies, amazed that the group have chocolate. When 
Tobin
 and another man come to check out some weapons, she feigns interest so she can unlock the window for later access. At the party, she socializes for a bit before sneaking off to steal guns. She takes three before 
Jessie Anderson
's son 
Sam
 spots her. She threatens to abduct him and leave him for walkers if he tells anyone what she had been doing. The next day she gives a gun to Rick, but Daryl refuses to take one.



"
Spend
"


After hearing a disturbance in her house from upstairs, Carol goes down to the pantry underneath the stairwell, where she finds Sam trying to steal ingredients to make cookies. He states that he can't make them at his house, because they don't have power (due to Alexandria's solar arrays malfunctioning). Carol is unsympathetic, and tells Sam to leave. Sam insists that he helps her make the cookies himself, and Carol reluctantly obliges, on the condition that he must steal chocolate from Olivia and not get caught in doing so. He is successful, and the two bake cookies. Sam then continuously tries to talk to Carol, despite her repeatedly asking him not to. Finally, she begins to open up to him somewhat, saying that cooking helps her to feel better when she gets sad. Sam then states that he breaks things when he gets sad, and that he was the one who broke the owl statue that he, Jessie, and Ron had been working on. Taken aback, Carol asks Sam why, but he counters by asking why she stole the guns. He then asks Carol if he can have one, only to run off back to his house when she asks him who it's for. She then goes to Pete and Jessie's house to make sure Sam was alright. When she asks Pete this, he nervously asks why he wouldn't be. When she asks to speak to Jessie, he grows even more nervous and says that she can't be seen right now. Having experienced this with Ed in the past, Carol is immediately cued in to Pete's abuse of Jessie (and possibly Sam), which she later reports to Rick. She tells him that he knows the only way he can put a stop to this: by killing Pete. 



"
Try
"


After the death of 
Aiden Monroe
, Carol prepares a casserole and delivers it to Deanna to express her sympathy for her loss. As she was preparing the meal, Sam appeared outside the house and told Carol about Pete's abuse of Jessie, including a harrowing incident where Sam found his mother unconscious in the middle of the night. Carol relays this information to Rick, who asks her why she cares about Jessie's situation. Carol tells him he knows why and then reveals she's seen the way Rick talks with Jessie. Carol admits that if the walkers had failed to kill Ed then she would not be standing there right now. Rick assures her she would, before briskly walking away. 

The following day, Carol witnesses a brutal fight between Rick and Pete. A frightened Sam runs to Carol, who comforts him as the battle continues. When Rick gains the upper hand, Carol watches as Rick points his gun at Deanna and the other spectators and tells them that don't know how to run things with the world the way it is now. He then reveals that their way of doing things is done. Carol appears to agree with Rick's speech, but he is  knocked out by Michonne.



"
Conquer
"


The morning after the fight, Carol visits Rick and Michonne alongside Abraham and Glenn. Carol puts on an act in front Michonne, Abraham and Glenn and asks Rick why he stole the gun from the armory. Rick appears somewhat taken aback that Carol wants to keep up their ruse in front of the others, but he plays along and says he stole the gun just in case. Glenn reveals that Deanna is holding a meeting to discuss what to do with Rick. Carol tells Rick he needs to tell the townspeople that he was worried about someone being abused and nobody was doing anything about it, and that he stole the gun to protect himself from a man who wound up attacking him. When Michonne asks her why that would work, Carol reveals that the people of Alexandria are children, and children like stories. Rick then comes up with a plan with the others where they take the town by force if need be.

Later on, Carol returns to Rick alone and wakes him up. She reveals it's good what happened last night and that they have more cover now, she then hands over a gun. Rick asks why she kept the guns from Michonne, Glenn and Abraham and Carol reveals that she did it just in case, because Michonne was the one who knocked Rick out. He assures Carol that Michonne is with them. Rick confides to Carol that he doesn't want to lie anymore. Carol points out that he doesn't want to lie but he also doesn't want to take the town, she then says "sunshine, you don't get both." 

Carol visits Pete and delivers him food. She insists that he check on 
Tara Chambler
's condition. When he tries to kick her out, Carol pulls out a knife and threatens him. Initially, Pete appears amused, but when Carol reminds him that everybody would believe her if she killed him in cold blood and then lied and said that he attacked her. He cowers upon realizing how serious and deadly she is. Carol calls him small, weak and nothing and remarks that with the world the way it is, he's even weaker. She hands over the food and demands coldly that she wants the dish back clean when he's done.

During the town meeting, Carol defends Rick against Deanna and continues her helpless act by revealing that she would be dead if it wasn't for Rick and that everybody should listen to what Rick has to say. Sometime later, Rick turns up and brings along a dead walker that got into the town after the gate was left open. After he makes a passionate speech about what needs to be done to keep the town and everybody in it alive, Pete enters the scene, armed with Michonne's sword. Carol urges Rick to not act straight away and see how it plays out. Pete then accidentally slits the throat of Deanna's husband 
Reg
, who dies seconds after. A devastated Deanna gives Rick permission to kill Pete, which he does without hesitation. Just then, Carol and the others watch as Daryl and Aaron arrive back into town alongside 
Morgan
, an old friend of Rick's from the early days of the apocalypse.

"
First Time Again
"


Carol is seen in flashbacks in this episode showing the aftermath of Pete and Reg's deaths. As Rick is explaining his plan to lead the large group of walkers away from Alexandria, Carol speaks up, supporting Rick and saying that although the situation is terrifying, there does not seem to be another way.

In another flashback as Alexandrians are building up the wall to block the walkers from heading in the wrong direction, Carol is seen handing out cups of water. She has a short conversation with Rick saying since Rick and Daryl are teaching her how to shoot, she should go with Rick and the others in the quarry with Rick jokingly stating that he thinks  Carol is good enough with a gun. Rick tells Carol to keep up her persona to get a feel of how the Alexandrians feel about Rick. Rick says they have a long way to go with Carol telling Rick that Deanna is in charge, but Rick is in charge now. Carol then has a conversation with Morgan. She hands him a cup of water and Morgan thanks her. Morgan asks her how long she's been with Rick and she says she's been with Rick since the start back at Atlanta. Morgan asks if she was a cop too like Rick. Carol asks why he thinks that and he says that he notices that Carol is always watching, always ready to handle things. Carol says "aren't you sweet" and she walks away.



"
JSS
"


Carol is seen talking with Olivia, Erin, and 
Shelly Neudermeyer
 in the pantry. She tells Shelly to stop complaining about the pasta if she plans on smoking inside the house. Later, while preparing dinner, she witnesses Shelly smoking outside. Suddenly, a member of the 
Wolves
 appears and brutally kills her. Carol springs into action, orders Carl to watch over Judith and sneaks out to help stop the attackers.

Carol notices the W's on the Wolves' heads, kills one of them who had just fatally wounded Erin, and disguises herself in order to move freely among the chaos. She holds Erin in her arms and attempts to soothe her as she bleeds out and then puts her out of her misery with a knife to the back. Whilst disguised, Carol kills at least four more Wolves in spite of Morgan trying to talk her out of killing the attackers. She makes it to the armory and finds Olivia hiding in a closet. She orders her to guard the bigger guns as she takes a bag full of the smaller ones to distribute to the others. She comes across Morgan tying up one of the Wolves and instead shoots him, rejecting Morgan's continuous efforts to stop the attackers by non-lethal means.

After the attack, Carol finds a pack of Shelly's cigarettes and briefly cries before noticing an A marked on the side of their house. At the end, Carol and Morgan walk past each other and share glances.



"
Now
"


A few hours after the Wolves attack, Rick returns to Alexandria, bringing half of the herd from the quarry with him. Carol is present as Rick gives a speech to the surviving residents, urging them to keep calm and to keep noise to a minimum. He also reveals that Glenn, 
Nicholas
, Daryl, Sasha and 
Abraham
 are yet to return safely.

Later that night, 
Spencer
 takes Carol's shift to go on watch for the missing survivors.



"
Heads Up
"


Carol is seen, along with Michonne and Rick, confronting Morgan about him not killing the Wolves that had attacked them earlier and letting some of them escape, where Morgan tells her, Rick and Michonne that he knows that the people that attacked them can still change, but Carol herself tells him back that the Wolves had killed and burned some of the people in Alexandria.

She is then seen again watching Morgan suspiciously leading Denise to the makeshift jail cell he had kept the W Man in and goes to Jessie's house to drop Judith off there. Sam then asks her if the people who attacked them are the monsters and that if she'll turn into one, but Carol says tells him that killing is the only way to prevent oneself from turning into a monster.

Later, she follows Morgan and confronts him about what he's doing, and later asks him who he is keeping inside.



"
Start to Finish
"


Carol is seen along with Morgan running from the herd that has entered Alexandria, where she trips and hits her head. Morgan helps her up and they continue retreating towards the nearby house with the makeshift jail cell just as the herd begin to infest the streets.

Morgan then tries to tend to her injury on her head, but she refuses. Morgan urges her to rest, at first refusing, but later does so to pretend to actually be resting. Afterwards, as Morgan turns looks at the makeshift jail cell, she shoves him aside and runs downstairs where she finds 
Owen
 below along with Denise, whom she orders to back away.

She and Morgan confront each other, where she tells Morgan that she doesn't want to kill him, but the W Man. Morgan tries to dissuade her from doing so, but Carol tells him that she has to in order to avoid letting more people die, refusing to let anyone else die. She then threatens Morgan that she will kill him if he gets in her way, but Morgan knocks her knife out of her hand and the two struggle against each other. However, Morgan later gains the upperhand and slams her to the ground, knocking her unconscious before he, himself, is knocked unconscious by Owen after becoming distracted.



"
No Way Out
"


Upon waking up, Carol is anxious to discover that Morgan was also knocked out by the W Man and that he has escaped, taking Denise with him. Carol asks 
Rosita
 for her gun. Later on, Carol watches the horde of zombies through a window when Morgan approaches her and tries to talk about her family. He then says he didn't mean to hurt her, but Carol doesn't want to hear this, and says he tries to convert the W Man for himself, not for the group. Carol then expresses to Morgan how she wishes she had killed him. Morgan tells her she can't and walks away.

Sometime after, Carol spots Denise and Owen making a run for the infirmary. She pulls out her gun and shoots Owen in the chest, whilst shouting at Denise to get to safety. Carol appears shocked to see Owen sacrifice himself to the walkers so Denise can escape.

Carol tells Tara that Denise is safe and also reveals that Rick is making a stand against the zombies with Michonne and several others. Carol joins them and helps fight off the walkers. The survivors are successful in winning back Alexandria. The following morning, Carol is among the survivors seen resting outside the infirmary, holding a silent and reflective vigil for Carl, who was seriously wounded by a bullet to the head during walker invasion.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"


Carol is first seen collecting ingredients at the pantry and acorn. She then bakes cookies and distributes them to the residents of Alexandria, and has a brief conversation with Tobin.

Later, she is seen at the cemetery, and is confronted by Morgan, who asks why she didn't tell Rick and the others about Owen. She evades the question and leaves, placing a cookie by Sam's grave.

She is present at the church meeting to discuss the Saviors and the course of action against them. That night, she writes down the names of every person she's ever killed, eighteen total. She goes out for a walk and again meets up with Tobin. He tells her that she's able to do terrible things but still keep her maternal instincts, being in some ways, a mother for the survivors. She then asks if he considers her a mother, and he tells her that he considers her something more, and they kiss. 

She is part of the strike team against the Saviors, and questions Rick as to why Maggie is with them, given her state. She is approached by Rosita, who questions her about Morgan and why they haven't told anyone about Morgan keeping the 
W Man
 hostage alive. "He doesn't want to kill," Carol says, defending Morgan. Rosita becomes defensive, but eventually agrees not to tell anyone.  

The group reconvenes on the road, where Rick proposes that they attack a couple of hours before dawn. Carol pulls Rick aside and chastises him for bringing Maggie on the mission. She insists on staying behind to help Maggie guard the perimeter. 

At night, she tells Maggie that she shouldn't be out there with them. She hears the alarm coming from the Saviors outpost, but stays behind with Maggie.



"
The Same Boat
"


Carol and Maggie are guarding the perimeter of the Saviors' compound, with the alarm at the Savior's base blaring. Maggie says they should go and help, but Carol refuses and tells her to stay behind when an 
armed man
 ambushes Carol and Maggie. Carol shoots him in the arm but spares his life. Three more Saviors move in and take Carol and Maggie hostage. 
Paula
 puts Maggie and Carol in a car and radios for backup. Paula's group brings Maggie and Carol to a slaughterhouse, where they're gagged and bound in a makeshift cell. 

Left alone momentarily, Maggie tries to cut her bonds on the edge of a wall. Carol finds rosary beads on the floor and pockets them. Carol begins to hyperventilate. Maggie is concerned, unsure whether it's real or Carol is pretending. Upon Maggie's insistence, the Saviors remove Carol's gag and look pitifully at her as she gasps for breath and prays. Carol begs them not to hurt Maggie and the baby, and asks Molly, one of the Saviors, to refrain from smoking on account of the pregnancy. Michelle, one of the other Saviors, surprisingly backs Carol up. Donnie, the Savior who Carol shot in the woods, shrieks with pain and threatens to kill Carol for his injury. Paula orders him to leave Carol alive as insurance until backup arrives in 30 minutes.

Donnie smacks Paula. Maggie trips him as he goes for Carol, and they fight. Carol thanks Paula for helping her and Maggie with Donnie. "You're pathetic," Paula tells Carol. Carol explains to Paula that her group killed the people at the outpost because the Saviors ambushed Daryl's group on the road, instilling them with a fear of Negan. "We had to stop him," Carol says. "Sweetie, we are all Negan," says 
Molly
 cryptically. Paula continues to share her story with Carol, making Carol herself see the vulnerability in Paula. After Carol tells Paula that she'll die unless she makes the trade, Paula eventually radios Rick again and tells him to meet her in a nearby field. Afterwards, she worries that the absence of static on the walkie means that Rick's group is close, possibly already outside the slaughterhouse. Paula contacts her reinforcements, who are now only minutes away. She and Molly leave Carol alone in the cell. In their absence, Carol sharpens the crucifix on the rosary beads and uses it to cut herself free. Carol finds Maggie and suggests they quietly escape, but Maggie insists, "We can't leave them alive. We have to finish this." 

They return to the cell and realize that Donnie died from his gunshot wound and is beginning to turn. Carol tells Maggie she has a plan. Molly returns to the cell and is attacked and bitten by a turned Donnie, who Maggie tethered to a pipe in range of the door. Maggie bludgeons the injured Molly to death, then Carol takes her gun and they race away. Maggie and Carol find a hallway full of impaled but living walkers, designed to slow them down or trap them. From behind, Paula fires at them until she runs out of bullets. Carol aims her gun at Paula and orders her to run, despite Maggie's insistence that Carol kill Paula. A walker attacks, causing Carol to shoot Paula in the shoulder. Maggie kills the walker, then races over to fight Michelle. During their struggle, Maggie's abdomen is slightly slashed by Chelle's knife, but Carol then manages to shoot 
Michelle
 in the head killing her. 

Maggie and Carol find Paula injured on the ground. Paula asks what Carol is so afraid of when she's so capable. "I was afraid of this," Carol says, alluding to Paula's death by her hands. Paula lunges at her. Carol shoves Paula into a speared walker, who tears off a portion of Paula's face and begins to devour her. Moments later, a Savior calls Paula's walkie to announce that reinforcements have arrived. "Meet us on the kill floor," Carol responds mimicking Paula's voice. As Maggie and Carol wait for the Saviors, Carol confesses that she has killed 20 people. Maggie urges her not to think about it. "I can't stop," Carol says and blames herself for not killing Donnie as they wouldn't have been captured in the first place. 

Carol and Maggie trap the newly arrived Saviors on the kill floor, which they've doused with gasoline. Carol throws her lit cigarette into the room and watches as the bodies go up in flames. Maggie kills the impaled walkers, including Paula, as she and Carol make their way to the exit.  They find Rick's group just outside the door, with 
Primo
 as their prisoner, about to storm the building. They tell them they already killed the remaining Saviors. As Maggie and Glenn reunite, Daryl asks Carol if she's okay. "No," Carol says. They hug. Rick then shoots Primo point-blank while Carol has blood dripping from her hand while holding the Cross.



"
Twice as Far
"


Carol's viewpoint on her previous actions continue to haunt her as she smokes on her porch, rosary beads in hand. Carol later joins Daryl by his motorcycle and asks him about his encounter in the burned-out forest with the man that stole his motorcycle. "I should've killed them", he tells her. He asks what the Saviors did to Carol and Maggie in captivity. "To us? They didn't do anything", she says. Carol is later seen with Daryl, helping him bury Denise. She watches Daryl pocket the Dennis keychain and take an angry sip of booze. “You were right,” Carol says, referring to Daryl's regret about letting the Saviors live. As the day goes by, Carol leaves a note meant for Tobin and the rest of the Alexandrians; in which she writes that she's leaving Alexandria. "I love you all here, I do, and I'd have to kill for you. And I can't. I won't," she writes.



"
East
"


Carol packs her bag in preparation for leaving Alexandria. She hides her bag when Tobin enters the room. He reminisces about Denise, whom he knew from the start of Alexandria. Carol only pretends to listen. 

That night, Carol slips out of the bedroom as Tobin sleeps.

Later, Carol drives down the road and runs into a truck full of armed men - more Saviors - who shoot out her tires. Carol steps out with her hands up, telling the men her name is Nancy from Montclair. The lead Savior, 
Jiro
, and another Savior named 
Miles
 recognize Carol's car as one of those parked outside Alexandria, and Jiro demands that she take them there. Carol begs them to return home, and when they don't comply and begin to approach her, she opens fire with a gun she had hidden in her coat sleeve. Most of the Saviors are killed by the gunfire, but Jiro, Miles and the Savior 
Roman
 survive. Afterwards, Miles feigns death but suddenly jumps out of the truck and starts shooting at her, while Roman slips away and Jiro hides behind the truck. Carol takes cover behind her car and impales Miles on one of the spikes as he walks around, taking his gun. She orders Jiro to come out from hiding, to which he refuses. He grabs a knife and charges at her, and a gunshot sounds.



"
Last Day on Earth
"


Carol is huddled in a library doorway when Morgan approaches. She tells him that she said not to come looking for her, to which he says he will start listening to her soon. He inspects the knife wound on her torso inflicted by Jiro and insists on helping her. 

Morgan dresses Carol's wound inside the library. He suggests they stay the night and return to Alexandria in the morning so she can receive proper medical treatment. She refuses. 

Carol explains to Morgan that she cares about Rick's group, which means she has to kill to protect them and she can't do that anymore. "If you don't want to kill, or you can't, then you have to get away from them. You do not get both," she says. She orders him to leave and points her gun at him, but lowers it soon after. Morgan later discovers she has left without him. 

Carol traps a walker and is soon attacked by another. She is able to kill it, just as the injured Roman ambushes her, tackling her to the ground and knocks her gun from her hand. He tells her he wants to watch her die slowly just like his friends on the road and shoots her in the arm. Carol smiles, admitting that she is happy to die. The Savior shoots her in the leg and begins to walk off, but Carol taunts him and tells him unless he kills her then she probably isn't going to die. He turns back and is about to finish her off when Morgan appears, and after a brief stand-off he shoots Roman dead. Carol begs Morgan to let her go, but he refuses and tells her she will come back from this. Two men wearing armor approach and offer to help.

The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
"


Carol briefly appears in a dream sequence with the rest of the group at Alexandria having dinner outside.



"
The Well
"


Carol regains consciousness in the bed of a horse drawn wagon. Her wounds are fresh; it’s been a couple hours since she was shot. The men on horseback, who previously offered to get Carol medical assistance, lead the way. Morgan walks alongside the wagon. Carol falls back asleep.

She awakens, disoriented; she sees Morgan fighting walkers with help from the men on horseback. She confuses walkers for humans in her hallucinatory state. Weak and distraught, she sneaks away. She comes across a cemetery and approaches the caretaker's abandoned cottage. An old woman beckons her from the window… then Carol suddenly realizes the old woman is a walker and she's surrounded by walkers. Several people ride in on horseback, just in time to kill the walkers. Morgan and Carol join their group. 

Carol wakes up in a bed. Morgan tells her she's been asleep for two days. Outside, Morgan pushes Carol in a wheelchair and tells her they're in a community called 
The Kingdom
. Carol takes in her surroundings: kids play in the streets, residents water gardens. Morgan predicts she'll need a week to recuperate from her injuries, at which point they can return to Alexandria. He tells her The Kingdom is run by a man who calls himself 
King Ezekiel
 and wheels her into a theater auditorium, where Ezekiel awaits with his tiger 
Shiva
. He introduces himself to Carol and welcomes her to The Kingdom. Carol, in the meek persona she used with the Alexandrians, pretends to be in awe of The Kingdom. Ezekiel offers her fruit, suggesting she at least take the pomegranate; Carol politely declines and thanks Ezekiel. 

Privately, Carol tells Morgan The Kingdom is a circus and vows to leave. Morgan refuses to let her venture out on her own. 

Later, Carol sits in bed and stares at her wheelchair. She wheels herself around The Kingdom and quietly steals a knife from a crafting table. She distracts a man who's folding laundry and steals some clothes from the table.

At night, Ezekiel catches Carol picking fruit from the garden as she prepares to leave The Kingdom. She adopts her demure persona and Ezekiel tells her not to "bullshit a bullshitter". "You're a joke," she tells him. He confesses that he's putting on an act and tells her about how he saved Shiva. After talking, Carol tells him she still wants to go. Ezekiel suggests a plan that would allow her to "go and not go." 

The next day, Morgan sees Carol to the cemetery. Carol enters the cottage and kills the old woman walker. She buries her outside, by the graves. 

Carol stokes a fire in her new home. There's a knock at the door; it's Ezekiel and Shiva. He offers her a pomegranate. She smiles.



"
Hearts Still Beating
"


Carol reads in her cottage and eats pomegranate seeds. She hears a noise outside and looks out of the window to find a sack of produce on her porch and Morgan about to leave. She opens the front door and invites him inside, where she reveals that Ezekiel has also been bringing her produce. She says people are having a hard time believing her when she says she wants to be alone. She asks how he is, and he tells her he is fine. He tells her she is going soft and is about to leave. When he opens the door, 
Richard
 is there with bottles of water and asks to speak with them both.

Carol listens as Richard reveals his fears to her and Morgan; he doesn't think The Kingdom can coexist with the Saviors. He believes they will inevitably destroy the Kingdom. Richard asks Carol and Morgan to help him convince Ezekiel to strike first. Carol refuses, saying she doesn't want to be involved in their lives or their deaths and insists on being left alone. Richard dejectedly leaves, and Carol tells Morgan to leave too. She forbids him from telling anyone where she is.



"
Rock in the Road
"


Carol runs into 
Benjamin
 in the woods while he's practicing his walker-fighting skills. She gives him advice on staying quiet and tells him to go home.



"
New Best Friends
"


Carol comes outside to find Ezekiel and some of The Kingdom residents in her garden. Ezekiel tells her they are there to clear the dead. 
Daniel
 apologizes to Carol for tripping her her wire used for walkers. As Carol says goodbye, 
Jerry
 hands her some cobbler which she accepts before telling them to go. 

She sits back down to read her book until someone knocks at the door. She answers and is met by Daryl, and the two hug. Daryl tells her that Jesus took them to the Kingdom and asks why she left. She tearfully tells him she had to.

Inside, Carol sits by the fire in her house and tells Daryl she couldn't lose any of them. She says if the Saviors hurt any of them she would have to kill them and there wouldn't be anything left of her after that. She asks if the Saviors came, and Daryl says they did. She starts to get upset when she asks if everyone back home is OK, so Daryl lies and tells her they made a deal like Ezekiel and everyone is fine. She smiles with relief and she and Daryl sit down to eat.

He asks if Ezekiel is okay and she says she thinks he is. As he leaves the house, he turns back to hug Carol and tells her to watch out for herself.



"
Bury Me Here
"


Carol wakes up from a restless sleep and lights a cigarette. After a moment of thought, she gets out of bed.

Carol leaves her cottage and heads toward the Kingdom. Along the way, she incapacitates a walker but neglects to kill it. Once she arrives, Carol single-handedly kills five walkers at the Kingdom gate. The guards, shocked by her skills, let her in. She demands to see Morgan. 

Carol finds Morgan in his room and demands to know why Rick's group visited the Kingdom. She asks if everyone in Alexandria is okay, despite what Daryl assured her. Morgan tells her she needs to ask Daryl herself and offers to return to Alexandria with her. She leaves. 

As Carol leaves the Kingdom, Benjamin asks her to teach him how to fight. She refuses. Carol then comes across the walker she passed earlier but is puzzled to find that it has been put down. She looks around before heading back to the cottage.

Carol is planting seeds in her garden when she hears a vehicle approaching. The Kingdom truck stops outside the cottage and Carol races over to help. They take Benjamin inside and Carol tries to stop the bleeding, but Benjamin dies. Ezekiel apologizes to her. She calls after Morgan as he abruptly storms out of the cottage.

Later, Morgan visits Carol at her cottage covered in blood. She asks what happened to him and he tells her that he killed Richard. He asks if she wants to know what happened at Alexandria and she nods. Morgan confesses that the Saviors killed Glenn, Abraham, Spencer and Olivia. He explains that Rick wants to fight the Saviors, and that's why he was at the Kingdom. Morgan prepares to go, intending to go after the Saviors. Carol chases after him and tries to convince him to stay at the cottage.

Carol returns to the Kingdom and finds Ezekiel with Henry. She tells him she's moving to the Kingdom to help them prepare. "We have to fight," she says. Ezekiel agrees, "but not today." Carol joins Ezekiel and Henry in replanting the burned crops.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"


Carol leads a regiment from the Kingdom toward Alexandria. They reach the blockade of shopping carts previously placed by Richard; it has been rearranged. Morgan appears, still emotionally unstable, and vows to hunt down the Saviors by himself. Carol tells him going it alone doesn't work in this situation. After being lightly prompted by Ezekiel, he joins them as they march towards Alexandria.

Carol and the rest of the Kingdom residents arrive just as Negan is about to execute Carl and begin to kill the Saviors. She works alongside Ezekiel throughout the battle.

After the battle is over, Carol attends Sasha's funeral. Later, she finds Morgan on the steps of a house by himself. She sits next to him and the two exchange glances, seemingly at peace with one another. She is then present for Rick, Maggie and Ezekiel's speech to the communities, all united for an all out war.

Mercy

Carol and Tara stand watch on a bridge. Tara checks the time. They spot a herd of walkers in the distance and smile. They both sit on the bridge and wait as the herd of walkers moves along the road below. Daryl joins Carol, Tara and Morgan on the highway. Carol, Daryl, Morgan and Tara wait on the highway until the herd arrives; they vacate the road in haste. 

Moments later, the SUV they parked on the exit ramp explodes. Dwight dispatches a large team of Saviors to investigate the explosion. Daryl and Morgan rig a tripwire across a road. They join Carol and Tara on a pedestrian overpass. The group on the overpass spots a walker nearing the tripwire. Morgan kills the stray walker endangering the tripwire and hides behind a dumpster and a patrol group of Saviors is driving through. They trip the wire and explode up in the street.

The herd approaches, drawn by the explosion. Morgan and Tara get in a car, preparing to leave. Carol urges Daryl to be careful. Outside the Kingdom, Carol and Ezekiel meet again. Ezekiel is happy to see her.

Carol and Ezekiel lead another group toward a third Savior outpost. They see a savior guarding the outpost and shoot at him. However, they all miss and the savior ducks behind a car for cover. He then throws a smoke grenade at the group which explodes, creating a big cloud of smoke.



"
The Damned
"


Carol and Ezekiel lay stunned by the explosion of the grenade thrown by the lookout. As they recover, they are attacked by walkers, and are able to take them out with the help of the half dozen Kingdommers accompanying them. The Savior, 
Nelson
, has escaped, and Carol warns that he will almost certainly be heading to the outpost in the woods to the north to warn them, in which case they will lose their advantage. Ezekiel confidently declares that they will catch up before he can do this, and tells one of his men to return to the staging area to bring the rest of the regiment along with Shiva.

In the woods, Carol, Ezekiel and the Kingdommers pursue Nelson, leaving a trail for the others to follow. Carol is pessimistic of their chances if he makes it back to the outpost, by Ezekiel reasons that pessimism doesn't bare thinking about, and remains confident of a successful outcome. They discover fresh blood, indicating that one of them hit Nelson, thereby slowing him down. With renewed optimism, they pick up the pace.

Carol and the Kingdommers finally catch up with the retreating Nelson, just as the rest of their regiment, over two dozen strong, arrive on their heels. Shiva intercepts Nelson and mauls him to death. Carol and the Kingdommers surrounds Ezekiel and Shiva in the woods. He rallies the troops and insists they have achieved certain victory. Jerry is holding the man's radio, where they hear that the nearby Savior outpost is sending out an active patrol, indicating that they know the Kingdommers are coming. Despite the concern of his closest advisors, Ezekiel is unfazed, and confidently prepares for the upcoming attack.



"
Monsters
"


Carol listens on as Ezekiel rallies and motivates his troops, over three dozen strong for the upcoming assault on the nearby Savior outpost. Carol notes that the Saviors most likely have the advantage of superior numbers, but agrees with Ezekiel that the Kingdommers have strategy on their side. Ezekiel is confident that if they stick to the plan, they will not lose a single person.

Ezekiel leads a small number of his regiment through the woods, where they soon hear Saviors whistling. They are quickly confronted by a group of around 20 Saviors, who hold them at gun point. Carol emerges from the long grass with the rest of the Kingdommers and shoot the Saviors from behind, while Ezekiel's group drop to their knees and open fire as well, killing them all and sustaining no casualties.

Later, Carol and the Kingdommers stealthily take out the 3 guards stationed at a building occupied by Saviors, before entering and killing the inhabitants, the first of 3 locations that make up the Outpost. They ambush a second group of around 40 Saviors, killing them all.

Afterwords, Ezekiel informs Carol they sustained no casualties in the assault, however she remains cautious and tells him they need to sweep the compound to be sure there are no survivors. He agrees and lets Carol take point. While his men begin putting down the Saviors as they start to reanimate, Ezekiel notices a window in one of the buildings and realizes they are being watched. He yells for his troops to scatter as 50 caliber machine gunfire begins to rain down upon them. Several Kingdommers are killed and Carol evades the bullets as Ezekiel's closest advisors swiftly knock him to the ground, shielding him from the hail of bullets. 



"
Some Guy
"


Carol is first seen in the 
Chemical Plant Outpost
. She approaches from the hallway, hiding when she hears another Savior calling out from behind, rushing the other Saviors into working faster. As they all gather into the joining room, they are all suddenly gunned down by Carol, who clambers down from within the ceiling panels. As she puts down the remaining Saviors, she is spotted by another group, prompting her to hastily escape. The men decide to ignore her, prioritizing the weapons' transportation. 

Carol manages to catch up to the second group of Saviors as they begin loading the heavy weapons into a truck. She attempts to ambush the Savior crew, but is fired upon by two of the men, forcing her to take cover. Carol is cornered by the Saviors, who are still peppering her hiding place with bullets.

As Carol hides from the gunfire, she looks up and notices a button that activates the nearby gate. She slowly disarms herself and, putting on an act, offers to inform the Saviors of the whereabouts of her comrades.

Deciding to take up Carol's offer, 
Yago
, the leader of the crew, asks where her people are. Carol stalls long enough to disarm one of the Saviors, 
Joey
, who approached her, and demands that they lower their weapons. Joey pleads for Yago to comply, but he is ignored and is promptly shot by the Saviors in an attempt to kill Carol. Carol, in turn, manages to open Gate 04, allowing a group of walkers to stumble in.

Carol re-arms herself and takes the fence gate keys from Joey's body. Two of the Saviors are killed by the group of walkers, diverting Yago and the other Savior's attention away from Carol. After the two remaining Saviors clear out most of the walkers, they hide from Carol's gunfire. She declares that both parties need to end their conflict there and now and affirms that the .50 cal guns aren't getting to their destination. She moves in to finish them off, but finds Ezekiel and Jerry in danger.

Carol is forced to help Ezekiel and Jerry continue to fight the herd, mowing down half of the herd with Joseph's rifle, as the two Saviors drive away with the machine guns. As Carol opens the gates, Ezekiel inquires about the heavy weapons. Carol responds that nothing can be done about them at the moment. Ezekiel is dismayed at this revelation and opts to warn Rick, but Carol, hearing a motorcycle and a truck in the distance, assures him that the guns won't make it to the compound.

Carol, Ezekiel and Jerry fight their way through more walkers. Ezekiel begins to falter and begs the others to leave him, knowing he'll slow them down with his injury, but they refuse. They eventually reach a polluted creek bed, where more walkers are roaming. They manage to push through, but Ezekiel turns back, fighting off the approaching walkers and yelling for the others to leave him.

Suddenly, 
Shiva
 jumps into the fray, mauling walkers and violently throwing several aside. As Carol, Ezekiel and Jerry watches helplessly, Shiva is set upon and ripped apart by the small herd, staining the waters red, but allowing ample time for the three soldiers to escape. The three make it back to the Kingdom, battered, bruised and broken. The townspeople gather to find that Ezekiel, Carol and Jerry are the only survivors of the fight.



"
The King, the Widow, and Rick
"


Carol is seen watching 
Nabila
 and the Kingdom decorate a memorial for the fallen that died at the 
Chemical Plant Outpost
. Carol readies her weapons, simultaneously. Two residents present her with notes from Rick. Maggie gets the same note from Aaron. Carol and Rick read notes from Maggie which inform them that they have Saviors as prisoners at the Hilltop. Maggie and Rick read the note from Carol which discuss the Kingdom being ambushed and murdered and her, Jerry and Ezekiel being the only survivors.

Carol marches past Jerry, who refused to leave his job despite Ezekiel telling him he's not their king and to Ezekiel. She bangs on the door and tells him they promised Rick they would meet. When he refuses to come out, Carol storms off and 
Henry
 tries to follow her but she rejects him.

In the woods somewhere else, Carol finds Henry fighting two walkers with his stick. She shoots the walkers and admonishes Henry for putting his life in danger. And warns him that being alone in the woods will lead to him getting lost and never seen again, or will be found as a "monster"; a reference to how Sophia died, and also reminiscent of when Carol told Sam he would wake up in the forest alone and surrounded by monsters, never to be seen again. He insists he is a fighter and wants revenge on the guys who killed his brother. Carol takes the stick from him and gives him her gun. He insists he knows how to use it and she orders him to keep the safety on until she says otherwise.

Carol returns to the Kingdom and approaches Jerry and orders him to the side. She takes aim with a shotgun but Jerry tells her the doors is not locked. Inside, Carol greets Ezekiel on the stage. He is sitting in front of his chair with Shiva's chain, pitying himself. "People out there need you," Carol said. Ezekiel, however, insists he was only playing a part. He knew and, yet, he smiled. He asks to be left alone, prompting Carol to walker away, only to come back and ask why he kept coming to visit her. "It was my duty," he said. "To make sure you were okay." Carol asks for the real reason. Ezekiel eventually admits that "you made me feel real, not a fiction. Real."

Carol tells Ezekiel that to her and the people of the Kingdom, he is real and his people need him. Carol reminds Ezekiel that he has his inspired everyone to build the Kingdom, to get this far and they continue to need his leadership. "You have to help them grieve, to move on, to end this. You owe them that, Henry needs you. Those people need King Ezekiel. And if you can't be the king then do what you do best and act the part. I have to act everyday, it used to bother me, but this is who I am and I am still standing. I just have to act like everything is normal, until it is. It's what they need and it's what you have to give them." However, Ezekiel continues to refuse.

A New Beginning
"


During the year and a half that passed since the end of the war, Carol entered a relationship with Ezekiel.

Carol and the group go to the Smithsonian in Washington D.C, to search for a covered wagon and farming equipment. Inside, Rick tells everyone to be safe and the group separates.

While returning to the main stairs, Maggie tells Michonne and Carol that 
Gregory
 called for an election at the Hilltop and lost, making Maggie the rightful leader. Carol jokingly mentions that she now lives with a king.

Shortly after, the whole group reunites and gingerly uses ropes to drag an old covered wagon down the stairs and over the glass floor. The glass finally gives way and Ezekiel falls through it, dangling by the rope. Before the walkers can bite him, Daryl shoots at one and Rick and the others finally pull him to safety. Carol joyfully kisses him to celebrate.

The group leaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities.

On the road, Ezekiel proposes to Carol. She tells him to put the ring away and reminds him she doesn't want to be asked yet, especially on a horse. Ezekiel smiles and tells her he still loves her.

Rosita and Daryl catch up with everyone to inform them that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Rick tells Tara, Gabriel, Aaron and Anne to head back to Alexandria and the rest will go to an alternate route and spend the night at the Sanctuary.

At the 
Sanctuary
, Rick and the group arrive to deliver supplies. Michonne points out graffiti that proclaims, 
"We are still Negan"
, and Daryl demands Justin to clean it up. Rick promises to the Saviors that he'll continue to support them so they can get back on their feet. Everyone applauds him and treat him like a celebrity.

Outside, Carol follows Daryl and offers to take over the Sanctuary for him. She tells him about Zeke's proposal and says she wants to take her time. Daryl's surprised and asks if he should stay with her. She declines and rests her head on his shoulder.

The next day, Carol tells Ezekiel she's staying at Sanctuary. Ezekiel feels that she is trying to be away but she denies it and kisses him, before telling him to kiss Henry for her and instructing Jerry to take care of him as they head off.



"
The Bridge
"


At a camp, which the communities have set up in the woods, Ezekiel explains to Henry how vital the bridge will be in connecting the communities. Carol hands Henry his stick, kisses him goodbye and tells Ezekiel she's still going to remain at the Sanctuary.

Later, Carol is present as Rick takes Daryl to his tent to calm him down, reminding him that they need the Saviors to help in building the bridge in spite of several deserters. However, Daryl says that the Saviors won't fall in line just because he says so.

Rick explains that he wants everyone to be on the same side, and Daryl questions if they actually are, before leaving. Carol advises Rick to talk to him once he has calmed.

When the herd arrive at the labor site and a commotion ensues, Carol arrives with Rick and the others to help.

Back in the main tent, Carol scolds Justin as Daryl arrives and angrily confronts him as to why the second siren wasn't sounded. Justin claims the radio wasn't charged and Daryl leaps at him, punching him repeatedly with a frying pan. Carol begs for him to stop as the rest of the camp watches.

In the camp, at night, as everyone laughs and talks, Carol asks Ezekiel for the ring. He gets excited and it's about to give a speech but she tells him that he can tell her the speech later. She puts on the ring and they hug and smile. Rick happily watches them from his tent.

Anne
 of being the culprits. They grab axes to retaliate when Rick rides in the middle of the group with his gun drawn and warns everyone to back off. 

Later, Carol listens as Rick implores his team to find 
Arat
 before the Saviors find out and leave, delaying the bridge construction.

On the woods, while Rick and Carol are searching for Arat, he says he's constantly tempted to kill Negan but stops himself by reminding himself to build life, not take it.

Suddenly, Jed and 
D.J.
 ambush Carol and Rick. He holds Carol at knifepoint while Rick points a gun at his head. Jed explains to Rick that this is about getting their guns back for protection before leaving. Carol sneakily pulls a knife out of her sleeve and stabs him in the shoulder while Rick forces D.J. to his knees. Carol tells Jed she didn't killed him because every life counts.

"This isn't real."
 Michonne tells him to wake up and he does, now alone on the bridge.

The walkers approach as Rick hobbles away. He makes it across the bridge and turns around hoping to see the walkers fall through, to no avail. A walker makes its way inches away from Rick before getting shot in the head by a crossbow bolt. Rick watches as Carol, Daryl, Michonne, Maggie, and the rest arrive nearby.

Maggie and Michonne hatch a plan to divert the walkers but Rick won't allow it. He notices the dynamite on the bridge, takes aim, and says to himself 
"I found them,"
 before shooting and igniting the dynamite. The bridge ignites and explodes as Carol and the rest can only watch in horror. Assuming Rick is dead, Michonne screams out while Maggie and Carol comfort her.



"
Who Are You Now?
"


Six years later, in the Kingdom, a longer-haired Carol wakes up next to Ezekiel and admires as everyone works in the community. She tends to the garden and watches as a flower blooms through the floor.

From a balcony, Carol watches as everyone works and Jerry jokingly refers to her as Queen. Suddenly, they hear a noise coming from the basement and find a teenage Henry trying to fix the pipes. Ezekiel arrives and Henry berates him about their deteriorating community, but Ezekiel warns him to watch his tone. Shortly after, Carol reminds Ezekiel that Henry isn't wrong and he could benefit by moving to Hilltop to become Earl's apprentice.

Later, Ezekiel bids farewell to Henry as he and Carol prepare to trek to Hilltop. Henry assures him they'll see each other before the fair. Carol tells him that Henry inherited the dreamer part from him and Ezekiel mentions that the fair is his way to reunite the communities.

Regina
 with a group of former Saviors. Carol runs over with a bow and arrow as 
Jed
 walks up with a gun and smiles.

Jed tells Carol and Henry that since the Sanctuary was abandoned they've had to get more desperate. He tells her he's going to let them off since she spared him back in the day, but he's taking all their stuff, including her ring. This angers Henry, who kicks up his stick and knocks Jed down. Jed throws Henry to the ground and Carol jumps in and gives him her ring. Jed thanks her and leaves with his people. 

At night, in the woods, Carol and Henry camp inside an abandoned vehicle. Henry scolds her for not defending herself but she says that she couldn't risk him getting hurt. However, a while later, Carol returns to the Saviors camp. She lights a match and reminds Jed that they hurt her son. She drops the match, igniting and killing all the Saviors she poured gasoline on, including Jed and Regina.

his dog
, Carol asks him when was the last time he ate. 
"Dog ate yesterday,"
 he says and walks off.

Carol asks why he's been living in the woods so long and he says it's quiet. She updates him on Henry moving to Hilltop while she deals with things at the Kingdom. Daryl asks why she's really there and she reveals she wants him to come with them. 
"Want me to babysit your boy?"
 Daryl growls. Carol admits Henry could use a mentor to toughen him up, but Daryl says he'll have to learn on his own.

A while later, Daryl skins a snake and throws it into the fire for dinner while Henry asks Carol if she brought him here so Daryl could be his chaperone. At night, Carol gives Daryl a haircut and he reveals he never found Rick's body and got used to being in the woods. Carol suggests he should let it go. Later, as they have dinner, Henry asks Daryl how he got his scar on the eye but he ignores him and leaves to find his dog. 

Henry tails Daryl and finds a walker instead. Daryl shows up and asks if he was following him. Suddenly, Daryl hears his dog barking wildly nearby and rushes over to find it stuck in a trap and surrounded by walkers. Daryl picks off the walkers to save his dog and before a walker can bite him, Henry jumps in and saves him. 
"I told you to stay back,"
 Daryl scolds. From the bushes, Carol secretly lowers her bow and arrow. 

Back at the camp, Henry notices an x shaped scar on Daryl's back as he changes his shirt. He sits next to him and tells him that this is the first time the dog got caught in his trap. Henry thanks him for the save and tells him Carol misses and worries about him. 
"She knows how to find me,"
 Daryl says. Henry suggests he should come to Hilltop with them. Daryl asks if it's so he can look over him, but Henry says 
"It isn’t just about me."

In the present, Carol catches up to Ezekiel and decides to accompany him on a deer hunting. Later, in the woods, Ezekiel suggests Carol take another caravan back to Kingdom while he goes with another group. Carol senses something’s up so Ezekiel explains he and his people planned a minor side mission to grab something for the fair. Carol agrees to tag along and they go to an abandoned movie theater.

Outside the movie theater, Ezekiel reveals to Carol that he wants to get a projector bulb, but she's understandably upset they're risking so much for something so trivial. Ezekiel explains how important it could be for families and she relents. Jerry then uses a boombox to draw the walkers away from the theater.

Inside, Carol helps Ezekiel unhinge a movie poster frame to use for their charter. Carol suggests to him that if the fair doesn't bring everyone together, they should stay at Hilltop. Suddenly, Jerry tells them that the bulb fell into the walker infested room. Ezekiel considers leaving, but Carol steps in and sets up a plan to retrieve it.

The Highwaymen

Later, on the road, Jerry and Carol scope out the highwaymen community while Ezekiel laments the violence they have to resort to. Carol suggests they try talking to them first, and if that doesn't work they'll kill them. Ezekiel, Carol, and Jerry infiltrate the Highwaymen base, where, the leader, 
Ozzy
, informs them that the meeting is for the King alone. They disagree, sticking by Ezekiel's side. Ozzy asks if they have his toll, while his people approach with their weapons drawn. He suggests they use Ezekiel as ransom when suddenly the Kingdom fighters grab Ozzy's people from behind. Ezekiel draws his sword and says he's prepared to fight for what they've created. He then offers the man a job to clear the roads for him in exchange for access to the Kingdom and the fair. Ozzy laughs in his face and draws Jerry's sword, telling them they'll have to do better than that. Carol then asks when the last time they've seen a movie and a shocked Ozzy responds, 
"Seriously?"


Back in the Kingdom, the highwayman return with Tara and the others, who assure Ezekiel and Carol they can be trusted. They hug Tara and ask where Henry and Daryl are, but Tara admits she thought they'd be there by now. Carol reacts in confusion and asks about her son's whereabouts.



"
The Calm Before
"


In the Kingdom, Carol and a group gear up to go look for Henry as the fair starts. Suddenly, Daryl, Michonne, and the convoy arrives. Carol scolds Henry for running away but embraces him, before going to Daryl to hug him. She and Ezekiel then marvel at how much Judith has grown while Tara spots Lydia among the group. 
"The plan was to bring Henry…just Henry"
 Tara says angrily to Daryl.

Inside the theater, Carol and the other leaders listen as Michonne says she’s finally ready for Alexandria to help out. 
"We're here now,"
 she says. Gabriel announces Alexandria is willing to grant asylum to Lydia, but Tara warns if her mother retaliates it'll be against Hilltop. Michonne reminds her that none of them were trusted when they were first introduced to Rick’s group, and Tara relents.

They all agree to send some of their own to Hilltop to guard against any potential attacks from the Whisperers and Michonne decides to re-establish the charter, establishing that an attack against Hilltop counts as an attack against all of them. Ezekiel then retrieves the original charter as Tara and Michonne finally make up. They all sign the charter, and Michonne tells Gabriel he should sign for Alexandria as the head of the council.

At the fair, Carol and Ezekiel find Henry and Lydia walking around and she tells her son she will say goodbye before leaving for Hilltop. Later that day, Carol, Daryl, Michonne, Magna, and others leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. She says goodbye to Ezekiel and Henry and looks at them with some concern as she departs. In the woods, she and the rest encounter Ozzy, 
Alek
, and D.J. and find one of Hilltop's carts overturned. She, Daryl, Michonne, and Yumiko decide to track any possible survivor. 

At night, Carol and the group gets attacked by walkers. They take them out one by one until the Whisperers surround them. Beta emerges from the trees and tells them to drop their weapons. "You just had to give me the girl," he growls at Daryl, telling him their deal is off. After the group is tied up, Alpha approaches them and tells them she ran into trouble on the road as she wipes her bloody knife on her pants. Michonne warns her if she tries to get Lydia back they'll respond in force, but Alpha assures her Lydia isn't her concern anymore. She takes out a shotgun and orders Daryl to follow her. 

At dawn, Daryl returns to the group and they leave back to the Kingdom. On their way back to the Kingdom, they find a beaten and bloody Siddiq tied to a tree. He points them to a nearby hill, which has ten pikes in the ground. Each spike has a severed head stabbed through the top. The group walk devastated towards it and look in horror at the victims: Ozzy, Alek, D.J., Frankie, Tammy, Rodney, Addy, Enid, Tara, and Henry. Daryl comforts a devastated Carol and tells her to look away. They then put down their friends and loved ones and head back to the Kingdom. 

Later that day, Carol listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.    



"
The Storm
"


Several months after the fair massacre, the Kingdom has fallen due to burst pipes, rot, and fires that have consumed multiple buildings across the community. In their house, Carol sorts through some of Henry’s old stuff and weeps in sadness. Outside, she and Ezekiel close the gates as everyone gets ready to leave and move to Hilltop.

On the road, the group spots walkers in a field but keep moving undetected. Later, as it becomes colder, Daryl reminds Carol that Henry wanted Lydia to be with them. She admits all she can see is Henry when she looks at her and Daryl asks what she sees when she looks at him. She assures him she just sees him and puts her hand on his shoulder. A while later, Carol and Daryl kill a couple of walkers. Daryl tells the group to keep moving as he and Ezekiel go to retrieve his bolt. She then finds a crying Lydia in the forest trying to kill herself, but stops her and brings her back to the group. As more snow starts falling, Michonne decides to take the group to Sanctuary.

In the Sanctuary, Daryl sits with Carol and she asks him if something happened back there between him and Ezekiel. He says no, but Carol's suspicious. She admits with Henry gone she feels like she's losing herself again, so Daryl offers to take Lydia away and protect her on his own, even though he doesn't want to leave.

A while later, Carol and the other leaders map their route through a frozen lake on Alpha’s land and Michonne warns they have to leave now or they won't make it. She decides to take the route, claiming they never agreed to the border. The group gets ready and leaves the Sanctuary. 

In the woods, the group passes the pikes into Alpha's territory. Michonne kills frozen walkers, unsure if they're Whisperers or not, before reaching the frozen lake. Daryl notices Lydia's missing again, so Carol leaves to find her and instructs him to get everyone across safely. She tracks down Lydia in a cabin and demands to know what she's doing. Lydia explains she can't cross the river because going to Hilltop won't fix anything because everyone will still blame her for what happened. 
"Your son's dead because of me,"
 she says, before asking Carol to kill her. Lydia holds Carol's spear to her own neck and tells her this is how she ensures they don't lose anyone else. Carol considers doing it but stops herself and kills a walker instead. 
"You’re not weak,"
 Carol says before taking her back to the group again.

In the morning, Carol and the group finally arrive at Hilltop, where Daryl knocks off the head of a frozen walker. That night, Carol tells Ezekiel she's going to leave him and head to Alexandria with the others. He reminds her he’ll always love her and she says she'll 
"never regret the fairytale."
 She hands him back her ring, but Ezekiel lets her keep it. The next day, Carol, Daryl, Michonne, and the others return to Alexandria. She then plays with the group in a snowball fight.

Lines We Cross
"


Sometime after the blizzard, Carol decided to leave Alexandria and adopt a life as a fisherwoman navigating the sea with the Oceansiders. Despite being gone to clear her mind following Henry's death, she has also been looking for Alpha to enact revenge. Months later, Carol returns on a boat and is received on the Oceanside dock by Daryl and Ezekiel. She awkwardly greets Ezekiel and quickly moves on to talk to Daryl, who lifts her up in a hug. 

As they walk around the camp, Carol tells Daryl about her travels. He thinks she is looking for Alpha, but Carol claims to be happy that the past is behind them. Daryl then informs her of the mask they found and asks if she wants to help them look but she declines, telling him she's only here temporarily. Daryl then drives the two of them off on his motorcycle. In the woods, Daryl and Carol try to hunt a deer in the woods. They follow it as it stumbles into one of the borders. Daryl stops Carol from shooting the injured deer as walkers devour it. Daryl rules that it is across a border and they shouldn't pursue it. Carol angrily reminds him they never agreed to the border.

Afterward, Daryl apologizes and the two make up. He admits he doesn't want her to leave again on a boat, calling her his best friend. 
"Best friend, what are you, 10?",
 Carol jokes and suggests they make friendship bracelets. She then proposes they run away together. Suddenly, an explosion rings out in the sky.

That night, Carol and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. The group runs out of water as a herd of walkers approaches the group. With their backs to the fire, the group prepares for a fight.

Carol and the group take their formations and start fighting off the herd. As they keep killing the walkers, Carol uses the spilling blood of a walker to put out a fire. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers. She and Daryl walk to the cliff where Alpha showed him the Whisperers' herd. Carol still wants to run away tomorrow, but Daryl wants her to stay. As he leaves, Carol sees Alpha emerge from the woods. She looks up and they stare at each other with anger.



"
We Are the End of the World
"


As Alpha emerges from the woods, she notices Carol watching her from the other cliffside.



"
Ghosts
"


Carol and the rest of the Alexandria residents face against waves of walkers pouring onto the community gates over the next 49 hours. During this time, Carol starts taking some pills to stay awake. After prevailing from the exhausting battle, the community discovers that a new herd of walkers is approaching from multiple directions. 

Later that day at an emergency council meeting, Carol listens as Michonne decides that instead of retaliating against the Whisperers, she and a small group will meet with Alpha at the border to work things out. Before heading out with the rest to the border, Carol hides a revolver in her pants and takes some pills. That night, Carol, Daryl, Michonne, and a few others arrive at the border and lay down their weapons. Alpha arrives with some Whisperers and reminds them to stay off her land. Michonne explains the fire would have wiped out Oceanside and they only crossed one time, but Alpha reminds her of two other times they trespassed. Alpha declares that there will be no bloodshed, and instead announces she's moving the border up as punishment. Carol says they don't have to listen to her bullshit.

Daryl tries to get her to leave but Alpha says not until Carol lowers her eyes to her feet. Alpha tells Carol she should fear her but Carol says she feels nothing at all. Alpha reminds her how Henry feared her before she beheaded him, causing Carol to pull out her gun and shoot. Daryl manages to hit her arm so she misses as the Whisperers draw their weapons. Michonne apologizes to Alpha for Carol's behavior and Alpha says she forgives her "mother to mother." Back in their camp, Carol tells Michonne, 
"Bitch has to die."
 Suddenly, Carol spots some Whisperers nearby and takes a shot, but misses. Michonne orders the group to capture, not kill them.

After searching around the woods, Michonne suggests to Carol that the pills she is taking is affecting her, but Carol brushes it off. The group then arrives at an abandoned school to rest. While inspecting the place, Carol finds a textbook where she hallucinates seeing herself at the head of the table with Sophia, Lizzie, Mika, Henry, and Sam sitting at the table. She then decides to keep watch while the rest sleeps. 

In a hallucination, Daryl accompanies her and tells a story about how his dad was a trucker and he once hallucinated seeing a girl on the road. He says that being awake for several hours can make someone see things, but Carol brushes him off. Suddenly, her alarm goes off and she takes her pills despite his pleas. She falls asleep and dreams of looking around the school. In a dark hallway, she hears Henry before turning around and getting stabbed by a mysterious figure. 

Carol wakes up to realize it was a dream. Daryl finds her and she claims to be fine. Carol insists that this isn't like the story of his trucker dad but a confused Daryl says he never told her anything. Her alarm goes off and she is surprised to see her pills in her pocket, thinking she had thrown them away earlier. She tells Daryl she wants to keep watch one more hour. As he leaves, Carol sees a Whisperer walking by the hallway and follows them.

Carol enters the gymnasium and falls into a trap that catches her upside down from the ceiling. The Whisperer leads a group of walkers towards her and she takes them out while freeing herself. After killing all the walkers, Carol cuts herself down and rises up as her alarm goes off and everyone enters the room. They head back to Alexandria so Carol can be treated at the infirmary and rest properly. Afterward, Carol is taken home so she can sleep.

In an idyllic dream, Carol wakes up to the sound of music and finds Daryl cooking in the kitchen. She then sees Henry at the kitchen table asking her where she's going. In reality, Carol wakes up and holds her now empty pills bottle as a tear rolls from her eye. She comes downstairs to find Michonne waiting for her. She swears she saw those Whisperers, but Michonne doesn't believe her. Later, Carol asks Daryl if he believes her about the Whisperers and he says he does.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Carol stays in her room during the night, avoiding contact with everyone for the moment. As Daryl leaves a tray of food outside her room, she opens the door and takes it inside to eat on her own. 

The next night, Carol leaves her room after hearing about Lydia's attack and her being rescued by Negan. She waits as Daryl exits the infirmary and talks with him. She asks what he's going to do about Negan. 
"I believe her,"
 he says. Carol reminds him the real enemy is still out there, and says that they should have gone to New Mexico. 

The following morning, Carol is looking over the house balcony and inspects a compass while holding a map.



"
What It Always Is
"


While unseen, Siddiq asks Dante over the radio for Carol. He leaves to bring her in so that Ezekiel can tell her about his cancer. Her footsteps can be heard approaching the radio, but Ezekiel then shuts it off at the last second before she can speak.



"
Bonds
"


Carol wakes up in her room. She rinses her face, gets dressed, makes some tea, packs a bag, and heads out. Before leaving, she ponders her gun in a drawer. Daryl sees Carol leaving and catches up, inquiring where she is going. Carol claims she wants to do another sweep looking for Negan, and Daryl offers to tag along. She reluctantly accepts. While traveling, the two discuss the possibility of Negan crossing the border and joining the Whisperers. Carol stops short of a clearing near the Whisperer border and pulls out a pair of binoculars. When Daryl presses her for the real reason they came there, Carol reveals that she wants to find Alpha's horde and destroy it. 

Carol tells Daryl that she's been tracking walker movements along the border, and that they all arrive to the area where they're currently at. She wants to observe the clearing for Whisperer activity, and see where they're taking the walkers. Daryl cautions that they won't be able to follow them without starting a war, but Carol claims they will only watch them and report to the Alexandria council before doing anything. Daryl then asks why she lied to him about their mission earlier; Carol tells him she didn't want him to worry about her after she pulled a gun on Alpha, and apologizes. She asks Daryl if he will stick around, and he confirms, claiming that she will need him to track.

Later that day, Daryl and Carol pass the time by throwing acorns at a can. Daryl hits it, but Carol says he has to knock it over. Carol finds a double-capped acorn and gives it to Daryl, telling him it's good luck and might improve his aim. He puts in his vest pocket. Carol then asks how things were at Hilltop. Daryl says Ezekiel sends his best. When Carol asks him how Connie is, Daryl tells her that there is nothing at all going on between them. Carol asks him why not and tells him he can't hide out with his dog forever, but he doesn't answer. The two share a meal before spotting a group of walkers roaming around in circles, quickly concluding there is a Whisperer among them.

Daryl and Carol are still observing the growing Whisperer herd. Carol points out that it will be tougher to track them at night. Daryl deduces that she wants to cross the border, and she confirms, if that's what it takes to destroy the horde. Daryl asks if she's sure she doesn't just want to take another shot at Alpha, but Carol says the horde is their shot. She asks if he is changing his mind, but he denies this and tells her they need to be smart during the mission, since they will endanger everyone if they mess up. When Carol excuses herself to go to the bathroom Daryl searches her bag, but doesn't find anything of note. Upon returning, Carol asks if he found what he was looking for. Daryl asks if she brought a gun like last time, but she denies this. They then head off to track the herd.

Before crossing the border, Daryl tells Carol not to leave tracks or kill walkers, since the Whisperers will know they were there if they do. He also tells her that if things go wrong, they will head back immediately, to which she agrees. That night, they observe the Whisperer herd from some shrubbery. Daryl signals Carol to retreat, but she ignores him. She then accidentally steps on a branch, which alerts the walkers and the Whisperer corralling them to their location. They separate and Carol somehow manages to take a Whisperer hostage. 

When Daryl later meets up with her, Carol claims that she didn't have a choice as the Whisperer spotted her, and suggests interrogating him. Daryl becomes skeptical of Carol's intentions and asks if she planned this, but Carol denies the accusation. When she pulls the Whisperer up, Daryl notices that his hands are zip-tied together and wonders where Carol got the zip-ties since they weren't in her bag. Carol claims that Daryl must have missed them. They then leave towards Alexandria. 



"
Open Your Eyes
"


Carol and Daryl bring the captured Whisperer to the cell to be locked up. While Lydia leaves quietly, Carol escorts the prisoner inside. Outside, Carol questions Lydia about the captive and she reveals he is one of the Whisperers in charge of herding the walkers. She also asks if he knows where Alpha's horde is and Lydia reckons that he does. Gabriel marches over and scolds Carol for risking the safety of the community with the hostage. He then orders that the Whisperer's wounds be treated first and demands to be present during the interrogation. As he leaves, Carol tells Lydia she can stay in her house in the meantime. 

While watching the community from the balcony, Carol offers Lydia ointment for her scars but she says she has had worse injuries before. When Carol replies that she has sustained worse injuries as well, Lydia is left thinking about her past. She then reveals that the captured Whisperer won't betray Alpha because he is loyal, but if they show him that a place like Alexandria can survive, there's nothing Alpha can do to stop the idea from spreading among the group.

Carol returns to the cell a while later to question the Whisperer as the group watches. She enters carrying a tray with a sandwich and offers him any flavor he wants as well as having salted fish for lunch. When she says she just wants to talk, the Whisperer refuses so she just hands him the bread. He slowly starts to eat it before being overcome with emotion. Suddenly, he spits it all out onto Carol's face. She presses her finger in his shoulder wound in anger and demands to know where the horde is. 

When the Whisperer implies that he would rape her if they were out in the wild, Carol puts on her ring and punches him repeatedly in the face. 
"You're all weak,"
 he tells them in response. Daryl pulls out a knife and threatens to cut off his fingers, ears, and teeth. The Whisperer says they are lying to themselves and he wouldn't betray Alpha because she loves her people so much she sacrificed her own daughter. The group is left surprised at this revelation. Carol sprints out of the cell and Daryl catches her, begging her not to involve Lydia because she has been trough enough. 
"This is the only way and you know it,"
 she says in response.

Later that day, Carol brings Lydia to the cell so the Whisperer can realize that she is alive but they are forced to leave by Daryl after he dies from poisoning. She then asks Lydia for her help in something and they ride off of Alexandria towards the woods. That night, they arrive at one of the borders on a bridge where Gamma is holding Aaron at knifepoint. When a shocked Gamma flees, Lydia realizes Carol used her for her own purposes. Carol tries to explain to Lydia that Alpha lied to the Whisperers about killing her but Lydia compares her to Alpha. Despite her pleas, Lydia says she chooses her own side and hits Carol with her staff before crossing into the border as well. Carol then rides back to Alexandria.



"
The World Before
"


Carol is present during Dante's interrogation in the infirmary after his identity as a Whisperer spy is exposed. She asks Dante what his original plan was after he insists that he had no choice but to kill Siddiq. When Dante confesses his motive for infiltrating the community and says he's looking forward to them arguing over what to do with him as they did with Negan, Carol looks at him in anger. Shortly after, she and Daryl update Aaron on the recent events. 

When Carol tells Aaron not to blame himself for not noticing Dante was a spy, he reveals that he has been talking with a Whisperer and she has told him the location of Alpha's horde in exchange for seeing her nephew Adam. Despite Daryl's objections, Carol tells him she feels fine to go on the mission and says she can help him look for Lydia afterwards even though she doesn't want to be found. 
"Are we talking about her or we talking about you?"
 Daryl asks as she leaves. 

Later that day, Carol attends the funeral service for Siddiq and listens to Gabriel's religious remarks. When the ceremony ends, she talks with Ezekiel who says that Siddiq was one of those people he thought would live forever. He then volunteers to help her finding Alpha's horde but Carol declines. She then asks if everything is okay and Ezekiel only wishes her good luck in the mission before she leaves.

Carol then goes alongside Daryl and Aaron to the woods to meet up with the group from Hilltop. She hugs Jerry after not having seen him for a while. That night, Carol nearly steps on a bear trap before Daryl stops her. He chastises her for acting recklessly and says they can't let Alpha take way their future too. They hug and then cross the border. The next day, the group arrives at the location of the horde in a clearing only to find it's empty, so they leave to go search for the missing Lydia. When Carol spots Alpha across a clearing, she chases after her into a dark building as the rest follow. The group then falls below a cave into a trap where they find themselves surrounded by most of the horde.



"
Squeeze
"


Having become trapped in the cave with the horde, Carol and the group recover from the fall and realize Alpha is watching them from the top as they look around for a possible exit. She screams at her in anger as the others look at her in silence. The group starts seeking other avenues of escape and eventually they decide to jump from rock to rock onto the other side of the cave in order to find another exit.

As the group moves through the cave, Carol hyperventilates a little and Connie asks if she's fine, to which she agrees. Daryl says that she has claustrophobia, making Carol surprised that he remembers. She is then confronted by Magna for their actual situation until Daryl stops her. Shortly after, he tells Carol he's tired of her reckless actions and wants her to stop seeking revenge. She answers that she wants Alpha to suffer for all she's done, but Daryl reminds her that they're not fighting for vengeance, but for their future. Carol promises she won't fool him anymore. 

When Magna is ambushed by a Whisperer, the group engages in a fight and kills several Whisperers, before deciding to follow the ones who escaped to find the exit. Carol is consoled by Connie and the group starts to squeeze through narrow tunnels where she briefly suffers from claustrophobic attacks until they find an underground mine station where Kelly discovers a box of dynamite. As the group starts digging for a way out, Carol takes one dynamite stick and goes back to climb a wall and find a good place for the stick to explode and destroy the horde. Daryl finds her and eventually convinces her to stop. He then tries to pull her up but the dynamite falls and explodes underneath them.

The cave begins collapsing and an injured Carol is carried by Daryl as they try to return to the others. Connie and Magna rescue and help them escape as Jerry holds a beam to prevent it from collapsing. Magna and Connie stay back and kill several Whisperers to protect Jerry, but he cannot hold the log anymore and leaves through the hole. The rest of the dynamite immediately explodes and the cave implodes, trapping Magna and Connie inside.

Carol realizes what her actions have caused and watches in tears as Daryl tries to excavate through the debris and Kelly falls to the ground in agony. She then rants to Daryl, blaming herself for all their troubles and pleads him to admit that it's all her fault. He ignores her request and tells the group to head home and inform everyone they found the horde, while he'll find the other entrance to the cave. Carol remains in tears and watches as everyone leaves.



"
Morning Star
"


Carol is seen brooding at Daryl's former camp, and Ezekiel finds her there and offers to comfort her, even though she claims he doesn't need to be. They both later arrive at Hilltop. Daryl sees them, but doesn't go to greet them. 

Later on, Carol knocks on Ezekiel's door and enters. She notices the lumps on his neck, and while Ezekiel brushes it off as nothing, Carol tells him to "never bullshit a bullshitter". Ezekiel mournfully admits that he wanted to tell Carol about his condition, when the latter suddenly kisses him.

After having sex, Ezekiel says that it was fun, although Carol states that that was never a problem. Ezekiel jokes about being at least fondly remembered for something, and notes that Carol has lost her sense of humor when the latter doesn't laugh. Carol claims she simply left it "on a dresser in the Kingdom" before it burned down. Ezekiel says that he left his pride there, too. He then asks Carol if their encounter would have happened if they didn't think they were going to die tonight, to which Carol jokingly says "Wait... we're gonna die tonight?". The pair share a laugh.

Back at the Hilltop, Lydia tearfully inspects the engraving Henry made for her, when Carol sits next to her. After lighting a cigarette, Carol says that Lydia should hate her, to which the latter replies that it's hard for her to do so, since Carol already seems to hate herself so much. Carol vows to kill Alpha, but Lydia points out that it won't save them. Carol replies that it will feel good, and asks if Lydia will hate her then. Lydia coldly states that she wont be thinking about Carol at all. Carol chuckles and thanks her for telling the truth. Lydia observes that people don't know how to do that anymore, so they simply stay away from both of them. Carol mournfully says that she had a life, to which Lydia simply replies "I know".

Outside, Carol approaches Daryl and asks him to not hate her. Daryl assures her that he is never going to hate her, before taking his leave. He grabs a morning star and heads out for battle.



"
Walk With Us
"


The survivors have retreated behind the Hilltop's walls, while the fire continues to spread, now engulfing most of the Barrington House. On the walls, Carol shoots several arrows at the herd, to little effect. With the gates down, the herd begins to pour into the Hilltop, while the survivors desperately try to hold them off. Carol is forced to retreat when the herd closes in on them and leaves with Yumiko, Magna and Eugene.

Meanwhile, Carol, Yumiko, Magna, and Eugene are resting in the woods. As Eugene is desperately looking over the little equipment he was able to salvage, a traumatized Magna recounts her experiences to Yumiko, explaining that she and Connie searched the cave for a way out, but got separated after running into the horde. Magna was unable to find Connie afterwards and doesn't know if she survived or not. Carol turns to leave, but is stopped by Yumiko, who angrily yells at her and even punches her in the mouth for her seeming indifference to Magna's plight. 

As Carol sits alone, a walker slowly emerges from the ground and tries to grab her. Carol just watches it at first, but eventually stabs the walker. It is then that she notices Eugene standing next to her, who wanted to offer his companionship after Carol and Yumiko's altercation. Carol asks Eugene if he knows what it feels like to want something so badly you put all your efforts towards obtaining it, anger everyone around you, maybe even get people killed, and still having nothing to show for it. Eugene, indeed, confirms that he does. He explains that he arranged a meeting with Stephanie, which he describes as the biggest meeting of his life, but will now be unable to attend. Carol encourages him to go anyway, to which Eugene smiles and tells Carol he hopes she gets what she wants. When Eugene leaves, Carol discovers Lydia's staff lying on the ground.

Later, 
Negan
 meets up with Carol and dumps 
Alpha
's reanimated head at Carol's feet. Carol smiles and tells Negan "took you long enough", revealing that they were working together the whole time to take Alpha down and that she was the one who release Negan from his cell.



"
Look at the Flowers
"


In a flashback, Carol visits 
Negan
 in his cell as he awaits for his sentence, 
having previously killed
 
Margo
. Surprised, Negan says that he thought Gabriel would be the one to give him his last rites. Carol asks if Negan wants forgiveness, but the latter denies this, joking about wanting a T-bone steak, some beer, and Rocky Road ice cream. Carol then offers a way for Negan to keep his life. Intrigued, Negan says that he wasn't aware Carol had a say on the Council, but the latter claims to be acting on her own. Negan, however, replies that he gathered that much, but doesn't understand why Carol would be talking to him instead of finding a way to kill Alpha, but Carol reveals that she is doing just that by talking to Negan. Impressed, Negan points out that Carol already missed her shot, and asks what happens if he fails as well, noting that it would endanger the life for every man, woman, and child in Alexandria, which he doesn't approve of. Carol simply replies that killing Alpha would help every man, woman, and child in Alexandria. Negan then asks what's in it for him, to which Carol notes that Negan has been politely receiving his punishment hoping the Alexandrians would one day forget what he did, but she claims that they won't, unless Negan does something to make them forget. If he kills Alpha, Carol vows to make sure the people remember him for that act instead of his crimes. Clearly interested, Negan asks for Carol's word, which she gives, provided Negan completes his mission quickly.

In present day, Carol places Alpha's reanimated head on one of the pikes marking the Whisperer border. Negan asks if this is what she wanted, to which Carol nods in approval. Negan then invites Carol to go back to Alexandria so she can tell everyone of what he did, but the latter angrily asks why it took him so long to kill Alpha. Offended at the question, Negan says that he wanted to escape with his head still attached, and points out that "shit like that takes time". Carol reminds him that their deal stipulated Negan had to kill Alpha quickly, but Negan still claims he held up his end of the deal, and now requires Carol to hold up hers. Carol then says that she is not going back to Alexandria yet. Frustrated, Negan points out that he will be killed on the spot if he goes back to Alexandria on his own, but Carol just suggests that he wait. When Negan asks how long, Carol tells him he is a free man now, and he can make his own choices. She says that she needs to be alone, and "shit like that takes time". She proceeds to walk away.

Carol, meanwhile, is walking through the woods when she hears a ghostly voice whisper to her. Although Carol doesn't see anyone at first, this voice soon manifests into Alpha. Carol continues her trek as Alpha's ghost taunts her, telling her that she is lost like her "boy", whom she sent away. As a result, Alpha claims, Henry died alone and afraid, just like Sophia. When Carol turns to confront her, Alpha vanishes, only to reappear right in front of her. Alpha warns her that Carol can't kill her unless she kills herself. She goes on to say that she respects Carol for what she did as, even though Negan was the one that slit her throat, it was effectively Carol who ended her life, "like a true "Alpha"". When Carol tells her to stop, Alpha surmises that Carol feels guilty and regrets what she did because people were hurt because of her vengeful motives, even though she can't take it back and her friends won't accept what she's done. Alpha suggests they might if Carol says she's sorry, but proceeds to taunt her by mimicking Lizzie's last words. Alpha then points out Carol tried being on her own before, but "they" have always pulled her back. She repeatedly invites Carol to admit what she truly wants. At this point, Carol is attacked by a walker, but manages to kill it. Upset, she tells Alpha that she wants to be alone, but Alpha doesn't think this is what she truly wants.

Carol arrives at a fishing shack, as Alpha questions if Carol's plan is to sail away downriver. Alpha insults her by claiming Ed was right about her, calling Carol a "brainless clam". She reminds Carol that there was no peace for her on the ocean, as she never stopped thinking about Alpha, and even wrote a letter to Maggie about her. Carol tries to ignore her as she struggles to free the kayak from the rafters, but when Alpha insults her once more, the roof collapses, trapping Carol underneath. Alpha then dubs Carol a "stupid cooze".

As morning comes, Carol is still struggling to escape the debris she is trapped under, as a lone walker crawls towards the shack. Alpha taunts Carol about her impending doom, and insists that Carol always knew how this would end. Alpha gloats that no one is coming to save Carol, including Ezekiel and especially Daryl after what 
she did
 to Connie. Alpha further taunts Carol with all the people she lost, including Sophia, Lizzie, Mika, Henry, and Ezekiel, and claims that, should Carol go back, Daryl could be next. Carol denies she would ever let that happen, but Alpha says that her track record does not inspire confidence. As the walker comes closer and closer to squeezing through the planks it got stuck on, Alpha encourages Carol to "do what she knows she has to", and uses the fact that Carol chose Alpha as her inner voice as proof, since she gets the job done. As Carol continues to deny she wants to die, Alpha tells her to "look at the flowers, like you're supposed to". Just as the walker breaks trough, Carol manages to free herself by dislocating her own shoulder and kills it. Collapsing on the ground from exhaustion, Carol tells Alpha "it's never too late", which causes her hallucination to finally disappear. Carol eventually returns to Alexandria, and Daryl welcomes her at the gate, although the two don't say a word to each other.



"
The Tower
"


Carol is among the Alexandrians to relocate to the 
abandoned hospital
 being referred to as "the tower". Luke announces that he needs someone to run an errand for him, for which Carol volunteers. Carol and Kelly, meanwhile, scavenge wires from some cars. Carol thanks Kelly for coming and tries to apologize for her actions in the cave, but Kelly thinks nothing of it, as she is certain that her sister isn't dead. Although Kelly is uncertain if she feels this way because her sister is so tough or because Kelly simply won't accept that she's gone, she understands Carol's actions, although Carol doesn't believe this absolves her. Kelly recounts how, when she started losing her hearing, Connie told her that the disability wasn't her weakness, but her superpower. She then observes how everyone is learning sign language now because of her. She then tells Carol that she heard stories about her from before, and about how she'd always go off on her own and do the things only she could do, and assures Carol that this is not her weakness, but also a superpower. She concludes her thoughts by claiming that you can't give up who you are because bad things happen.



"
A Certain Doom
"


Carol and the group just barely make it back to the Tower. At the hospital stairway, Carol and Daryl are setting traps. Daryl tells Carol about Michonne 
leaving
 and how he keeps thinking he's never going to see her again, just like everyone else. Carol reassures him that she is still there. Upstairs, they join the others as Gabriel goes over the plan with the rest of the group. Carol is about to grab a knife before, but runs into 
Dianne
 and 
Bertie
. Bertie gives Carol a look while walking away. Dianne confronts Carol about the fact that Negan helped the Whisperers attack Hilltop and that they can't forgive him for that. Carol tells her she's sorry, but Dianne has to forget about it. Lydia comes into the room and asks if Carol needs her help. Carol says she doesn't need her help. Lydia tells that's she doesn't want Carol to avoid her, and reveals that she is kind of relieved 
Alpha
 is dead. She also tells her that's she doesn't see Carol as new mom, but more as a really good friend.

Carol Daryl, Beatrice, 
Kelly
, Magna, Jerry, Luke and Jules smear each other in walker guts in order to blend in with the herd and make it through. Outside, the survivors find it increasingly difficult to move through the herd but, eventually, most reach the relative safety of the forest, leaving only Carol and Beatrice to find their way out of the herd. The pair slowly navigate through, but are spotted by a 
Whisperer
. She attacks them, but is stabbed by Carol on the gut, and attacked by walkers as she screams. With her last breath, however, the Whisperer grabs Beatrice and stabs her in the leg, causing her to scream and be quickly swarmed by walkers. Beatrice tries to give Carol the backpack she was carrying, but is ignored and torn apart. Luckily, Lydia, wearing her mother's mask, is able to retrieve the bag and hands it to Carol.

With the horde turning back towards the Tower, Daryl warns Gabriel that they have lost the wagon and the others have walkers coming right back at them. Luke points out that the others should've evacuated by now with Jerry stating that the others are unprotected and they need to turn the horde around. Daryl suggests going back into the horde and hunting down the Whisperers one by one while Lydia offers to lead the horde away, having been taught how to by 
Alpha
. Daryl and Luke object to Lydia's plan with Luke pointing out that without the wagon to lead the walkers over the cliff, its a suicide mission. Deciding to deal with that later, Daryl leads Marco, Carol, Luke, Jules, Magna, Jerry, Kelly and Lydia into the horde where they stealthily assassinate all of the Whisperers while Daryl and Negan take out Beta, allowing Lydia to lead the horde away and complete Luke's plan. Lydia has successfully led the herd to the cliff. Before she can go over, she is stopped by Carol, who volunteers to go instead of her, dubbing it her choice. Carol reaches the edge, but before she can step off, Lydia pulls her back. The pair take cover behind a rock, as the walkers around them march off the cliff into the waters below. As Carol thanks Lydia, the latter rips off her mother's mask and tosses it over the cliff.

Back at the woods around the Tower, everyone is reunited with Maggie, including Judith. Carol and Lydia arrive and inform the group that the herd is finished. Carol talks with Daryl, as Daryl asks if Carol got what she wanted. She replies that she didn't, but didn't really want it anyway. Daryl tells her that she still has him, and they hug. Daryl reminds her that New Mexico is still out there. She says that they might go there some day, but still have things to do here.



"
Home Sweet Home
"


Near the 
Hilltop
, Carol and Daryl are joined by Maggie, along with two other members of her group, whom she introduces as 
Elijah
 and 
Cole
. Maggie explains that she and 
Hershel
 have been living with the group until the destruction of their village, so she thought she'd resettle everyone at Hilltop. Carol and Daryl give each other an uneasy look, much to Maggie's confusion. Things are cleared up once the pair show Maggie that Hilltop has been destroyed. While she is looking over the burnt out husk that was once her home, Carol tells Maggie that Negan was with the Whisperers the night that it burned down. Maggie realizes it was Carol who let him out, but the latter defends her actions, asserting that Alpha needed to die, and Negan was their best chance at making that happen, and that he is the reason they didn't lose everything. Cole asks if they're supposed to just live alongside Negan in 
Alexandria
 despite the fact that he burned down the Hilltop and killed Maggie's husband, to which Daryl replies that they're still figuring things out. Maggie thanks Carol for telling her, before storming off. As the others follow her, Daryl tells Carol that she didn't have to reveal anything, but Carol think she owed Maggie the truth. Daryl says that he will help Maggie retrieve the rest of her group in an attempt to smooth things over, but Carol doesn't believe Maggie will ever come around on Negan. When Daryl asks if Carol has, she simply shrugs and says it was nice to see Maggie again.

A few days later, Carol helps clean up the destruction in Alexandria left behind by the Whisperers. She works alongside Nabila, Lydia, Negan, Barbara, and several other residents when Daryl returns with 
Kelly
 and Maggie’s group.



"
Find Me
"


Carol approaches Daryl about to go on a hunting trip, when she notices a map that Daryl dropped and picks it up. With Daryl struggling to start his bike, she offers to do it for him, as she has experience with peddle sewing machines. Daryl declines her offer, but supposes Carol wants to come along, which she confirms. After he manages to start the bike, she climbs on it as well, despite Daryl's reluctance. The two playfully bicker as they ride away, with 
Dog
 running beside them. After stashing the bike in some shrubbery, the pair find a deer trail, but it turns out the deer has already been partially devoured when they find its corpse. They discuss where to hunt next. Daryl suggests the river, but asks if Carol is okay with that, which she affirms. 

After a lengthy trek, Carol gets a foot cramp. Daryl thinks might have been better off searching for food in another area, but Carol wants to spearfish before moving on. Despite Daryl's doubt of her abilities, Carol spears a fish on her first try. Later, as they're filleting Carol wonders if their luck has run out, with the recent losses of Hilltop and Alexandria. Daryl points out they didn't lose Alexandria, and is confident they can rebuild, but Carol is more pessimistic, as she believes rebuilding is futile and the dead will catch up to them eventually. Daryl says he isn't going to let that happen, before cutting off the conversation altogether. Suddenly, Dog takes off running after something, with Daryl and Carol rushing after it. Dog leads them to an old, abandoned 
cabin
, which Daryl clearly recognizes. He briefly remembers a 
woman
 playing with Dog on the porch. Carol suggests they stay the night, as Daryl reminisces further.

In a flashback five years ago, when he was still searching for 
Rick
, Daryl reunites with Carol, who briefs him on current events, such as the increased isolation of the communities and Maggie leaving Hilltop. Carol impatiently asks how long Daryl plans on staying out in the wilderness, as it's already been two years. Daryl doesn't know, but supposes he will be searching for as long as it takes. Carol understands and says that she would help him if she didn't have obligations at the Kingdom with 
Henry
 and 
Ezekiel
, but Daryl assures her that he knows. Before he leaves, she tosses him some supplies.

Back in the present, Dog fixates on a spot on the floor. When Carol removes the floorboards, she finds a box with a note inside. Reading it, Carol realizes the cabin belonged to the woman from Daryl's past. She asks him about this, but Daryl is dismissive, letting Carol know that he already told her everything. Carol, however, doesn't believe him. Sighing, Daryl asks what else she wants to know, to which Carol replies that she will listen to whatever Daryl wants to tell her.

After finishing his story, Daryl laments that he should have been there to help 
Leah
. Carol asks if he thinks Leah is still alive or someone took her, but Daryl doesn't know. Carol considers the possibility that Leah left on her own. Daryl denies this, and blames himself for walking away. Carol comforts Daryl that it's not his fault every time he loses someone, and that losing Leah isn't on him, nor is losing Rick or 
Connie
. Daryl resentfully agrees to Carol's last example, as he blames Carol for losing Connie instead, since she never knows when to stop. Carol says that she is sorry for Connie, but isn't sorry for going after the 
horde
 nor making Alpha pay for killing Henry, because she was right. Daryl begrudgingly asks if her being right is all that matters. Carol realizes Daryl isn't upset with her because of Leah or Connie, so invites him to say what he really means. 

Daryl tells her that she shouldn't have come. Carol claims she just wanted to help, but Daryl retorts that she wanted to run instead, so that's what she did. Carol seems confused by this assertion, but Daryl thinks she ran because she couldn't deal with the guilt, so she made it his problem. Carol snaps back that Daryl's only problem is thinking he has to save everybody, and that she doesn't need a savior or a martyr, but a friend. Daryl asserts that friends don't have the same conversation over and over again, and that he is sick of it. Carol says that, in that case, Daryl should have let her get back on the boat. He coldly agrees that he shouldn't have stopped her, and gives her permission to run if she wants to, as he won't stop her this time. He, however, maintains that he knows where he is supposed to be. Carol sadly states that she was right, as their luck has indeed run out. She heads inside the cabin, leaving Daryl standing alone on the porch.



"
Diverged
"


Carol and Daryl walk back to Alexandria in silence. Daryl gives Carol his pocket knife to open her canteen and says he's going to keep looking for supplies. He starts to apologize for their argument at the 
cabin
 but Carol stops him. They split up and take different paths. 
Dog
 follows Carol. Carol returns to Alexandria. She goes home and tells Dog that Daryl meant what he said during their argument. Dog licks her.

Carol asks 
Jerry
 if she can help out with work around Alexandria. Jerry says all the tasks are already being taken care of. Carol begs Jerry for a task and offers to make him soup for lunch. Jerry warns that she will have to cook without electricity, since the 
Whisperers
 damaged some solar panels. Carol collects ingredients in her pantry and starts to cook soup. She hears Dog barking in the living room and finds him tearing the room apart in search of a rat. She admonishes Dog and starts cleaning up. Dog races to the pantry and paws at a spot in the wall where the rat is hiding. Carol sends Dog out of the pantry and starts building a rat trap.

Carol collects supplies from the living room and finishes building the rat trap. She sets the trap on the pantry floor and leaves. Carol heads outside with a bucket and tells Jerry she's going to forage for soup ingredients. Carol picks herbs in a field and sees 
walkers
 approaching. She slays all the walkers then returns to her bucket of herbs. Carol returns to Alexandria covered in blood. Jerry asks if she's okay. She assures Jerry that she's fine and keeps walking with her bucket of herbs.

Carol dumps the herbs in her pantry and checks the rat trap. It's empty. Carol uses the pocket knife to fix a solar panel. Jerry asks if she needs help. Carol says she's fine. Carol returns to the pantry and turns on the light. It works. Carol returns to the pantry and starts cooking. She hears the rat scratching and checks the trap. She screams as the rat scurries out. She chases the rat around the pantry before it disappears into the wall. The power goes out. She unplugs the crock pot and plans to continue cooking when there is more solar power the next day.

Carol retires to her bedroom at night. Dog jumps into bed with her. Carol admits that she misses Daryl and says he always comes back. She wonders if she should leave Alexandria so that she can be out of everyone's way. Dog wakes Carol in the middle of the night. She grabs her flashlight. Carol and Dog go downstairs. Carol hears the rat in the wall and cuts a hole in the wall to find it. She cuts a bigger hole, then starts tearing out insulation. She demolishes the wall and sinks to the ground.

Carol cooks soup the next morning and begins cleaning the debris from the wall. Jerry checks in to see if she's okay. Carol admits she had a bad day. Jerry says he noticed that she came home without Daryl and guessed that she was having a bad day. Carol worries that she's a broken person. Jerry hugs her and assures her that he is still her friend. The rat scurries outside. Carol invites Jerry in for soup.

Daryl returns to Alexandria and parks his motorcycle. Dog races up to Daryl. Carol greets Daryl and notes his disheveled appearance. Daryl notes her disheveled pantry. Carol tries to return the pocket knife but Daryl lets her keep it. Daryl goes inside to sleep.



"
Here's Negan
"


Carol accompanies Negan while hunting and thanks her for getting him out of Alexandria for awhile due to how tense things currently are with Maggie. Although he doesn't mind being "lay low Negan" for a bit, Negan asks if Carol can help him smooth things over with Maggie, stating that given his and Carol's recent history, Negan feels that she at least owes him that much. Carol leads Negan to 
Leah's Cabin
 where he finds his belongings inside. Carol explains that Daryl helped her to move Negan in and that 
the council
 has voted to banish him and that what Negan wants isn't going to happen and that it's not possible. Carol feels that given their less recent history, its better than Negan deserves. Although disappointed, Negan accepts this and asks if he was really banished by the council or if Carol acted on her own again. With a smile, Carol tells Negan that the rabbit they caught is for him and leaves without answering Negan's question.

Carol is later seen working with Maggie and is shocked to see Negan returning to Alexandria. Carol confronts him and promises that if they find any food at an old Army base that Daryl found she will bring some by his cabin, but Negan intends to move back into Alexandria permanently and wants Carol's help requisitioning a cart to bring back his stuff. Carol promises to get Gabriel to approve it, but warns Negan that if he stays, Maggie will kill him and Carol didn't want his death on his conscience and now it's not. Negan acknowledges that its "fair enough", as he walks back into Alexandria.

"
Acheron: Part I
"


Carol is part of a group consisting of Daryl, Elijah, Maggie, Jerry, Alden, Rosita, Lydia, Gabriel, Gage, Roy, Kelly, and Magna who raid the abandoned 
Fort Connors
 military base for food supplies. Carol, Maggie and Rosita load the backpacks onto a pully system. After the mission, Carol returns to Alexandria with her fellow survivors.



"
Hunted
"


Carol arrive on Alexandria's walls with Kelly. On her way to the storage room, Carol walks by Aaron and a group of Alexandrians fixing the wall. Aaron asks if she is leaving already, noting that she was supposed to help with the wall repair. Carol claims to be preoccupied, as she plans on catching Alexandria's runaway horses. Speaking from personal experience, Aaron warns her that there is little hope for her actually catching the horses, and believes repairing the walls to be more important. Carol protests that, without the horses, they won't be able to scavenge far or move anything heavy, meaning they will starve.

In the woods, Carol, Magna, and Kelly stumble upon Rosita picking mushrooms. Rosita is keeping herself busy while Gabriel's on a mission, so gladly joins Carol and the rest in their attempt to retrieve horses. When they finally find them, they try several times to carefully to sneak up on them, but fail, as the horses get spooked before they can lasso them. Catching up with Carol, Rosita confides in her that she's been having dreams about 
Abraham
 recently. In her dreams, Abraham tries to tell Rosita something important, but just as he's about to, he gets shot in the head. Rosita used to be disturbed by this dream, but now believes it to be a message for them, although she doesn't know what Abraham is trying to say.

Carol and her companions continue their search, until they discover the mutilated bodies of several horses. Kelly is distraught by the sight, while Magna comforts her. Despite this, Carol wishes to continue the search. Rosita protests that they can continue tomorrow, but Carol is adamant. Noticing her distress, Magna comforts Carol with a hug, convincing her to call of the search. On their way back, Kelly assures Carol they'll get them next time. Rosita, however, hear hoofbeats and realizes they still have a chance to catch the horses. In a clearing, they see five horses galloping. Rosita notes the horses are running towards the 
dairy farm
, which has paddocks where they can lock them in. At the farm, they successfully trap the horses, but have yet to catch them, until Kelly insists they drop the lassos. She thinks the horses aren't running and, in fact, want to come home. Carol manages to calm a horse down enough that it allows the women to pet it.

Carol and her group arrive back to Alexandria with the horses in tow, much to the joy of other Alexandrians. While they tie down the rest, Carol proceeds to lead one horse away. Magna catches up with Carol, wishing to talk. Magna requests that Carol stop giving Kelly false hope. Carol is confused, but Magna knows Carol doesn't think 
Connie
 is alive, but can't accept what it means if she isn't. Carol thinks that Magna, being Connie's family, would want to know either way, but Manga replies that she just wants her family to heal. While she is sorry for what Carol is going through, Magna nonetheless asks her to stop what she's doing, as she is just making it harder for Kelly. Carol leads the horse to the stables and gets it to lie down. After calming it, she slaughters the horse for food. Later that day, Alexandrians feast on horse meat. The children are reluctant to eat it, but Hershel assures them it isn't that bad, or better than spiders at least. Outside, Rosita takes 
Coco
 to see the horses, while Carol washes the horse blood off her hands. Magna and Kelly eat together, until Carol arrives to take Kelly an another run, much to Magna's dismay.

Aaron spots the Whisperer and shoves him to the ground, then yanks off his mask. 
Lydia
 recognizes the Whisperer and tells Aaron not to kill him.

Aaron interrogates the Whisperer, whose name is 
Keith
. Keith insists that he's the only Whisperer left at Hilltop. Lydia defends Keith, but Aaron doesn't believe him. Jerry and Aaron drag Keith to the root cellar and find other Whisperers hiding. Keith insists that they are the last ones. Jerry spots Nabila's scarf and realizes that these Whisperers helped burn down Alexandria. Keith grabs a knife and slashes Aaron, allowing the other Whisperers to escape.

Aaron and Jerry suspend Keith from the rafters of a stable and demand to know how many more Whisperers there are. Keith begs Lydia for help. Aaron pushes a walker on Keith's hand then offers to amputate it and prevent infection if Keith tells them where his people are. Carol kills the walker and warns Aaron not to go down the same dark path she did after Henry was killed, as it did not bring her peace, that she put her group's life in danger and has regretted it ever since and tells Aaron she has to live with her actions and begs him not to kill Keith.

Aaron eventually spares Keith, who amputates his arm and thanks Carol. He reveals that he saw one of their people emerge alive from the 
cave
 where

 kept her 
horde

Connie

"
A New Deal
"


Daryl
 is holding 
Hornsby
 hostage as the group is surrounded by Commonwealth 
soldiers
. Suddenly, 
Mercer
 yells for everyone to put their weapons down as he, 
Pamela
, Carol, and 
Negan
 arrive at the scene. Daryl pins Hornsby to a wall with his knife at his throat. Pamela orders him to lower the weapon since she needs Hornsby alive, but he refuses. Mercer also tells Daryl to lower the knife and that he's on Daryl's side, and Daryl tells him to 
"Do what you fuckin' gotta do."
 Carol steps forward and says she made a deal for them which gets them all out of the situation unharmed, but they need Hornsby alive for it to work. Daryl finally obliges and lets Hornsby go. However, he suddenly slams Hornsby's hand down and stabs it hard with his knife. Hornsby screams in pain before Daryl removes the knife, stating "He'll live." before dropping his knife and walking away.

The group stands outside as Carol explains the deal. Pamela will provide all the supplies they need to rebuild on their own and let them go free. Whether they want to go back to their old communities or stay at the 
Commonwealth
 is up to them. In return, Pamela will have Hornsby to frame for 
Sebastian
's crimes. 
Annie
 says they'll have more time to talk about the situation with their people, but Negan points out that the Commonwealth killed most of their people. 
Maggie
 says the most important thing is everyone is together and doesn't want to go it alone anymore. Although she doesn't trust the Commonwealth, if the deal gets their home back, then she's all for it. Daryl agrees as he grabs an apple.

The group starts to pack their things to head to their community. 
Aaron
 says he'll head to 
Oceanside
, not knowing that the Commonwealth soldiers also went there, to fill in 
Rachel
 and 
Cyndie
 on the plan. Maggie tells Aaron to head to 
Alexandria
 first since it's better shape than 
Hilltop
. 
Lydia
 also plans on joining Aaron and tells Carol. Just then, 
Elijah
 walks over and affectionately puts his hand over her shoulder. He walks away and Carol jokingly teases Lydia. She apologizes saying that she hasn't forgotten about 
Henry
. Lydia begins to tear up and Carol hugs her and tells her to take happiness wherever she can get it and to never be sorry about it. Daryl asks if Lydia is okay before saying he never got to thank her for saving Carol. Lydia answers that she never thanked Daryl for saving her. They hug and say their farewells. Aaron hugs goodbye to 
Gracie
 and says he'll be back soon. Daryl takes out 
Rick
's gun and hands it to 
Judith
, but she states she doesn't want it and hands it back. Daryl is confused but takes it back. Judith then brings up when her 
mom
 said she'd hang her sword up for good and feel like she didn't need it anymore and believes if she keeps the gun, things will go back to the way they were. Daryl says that things will get better once they get back home, but Judith continues to go on, saying that it's still broken and that there are still people who need help at the Commonwealth. She then says it's the same thing as what him, Rick, and Michonne did with Hilltop, the only difference being that he's running away then stay and fight. Daryl gets frustrated and tells her to stop. Judith walks away and hugs Gracie as Aaron, 
Jerry
, Lydia, and Elijah leave for Oceanside.

At the Commonwealth citizens enjoy the Founders day festivities. 
Ezekiel
 is putting the animals in their pens, but Carol tells him he doesn't have to do it anymore. However, Ezekiel reveals that he wants to stay, saying his place is here at the Commonwealth. He says that he originally came to Commonwealth to help his people one last time, and it then gave him another chance to do more good, so that's what he's going to do. Ezekiel lets some kids into the pen and says they can all be better.

At their apartment, Daryl is finishing packing up. He puts on his signature vest and walks to the living room where 
R.J.
 is reading a comic book. Daryl asks R.J. where Judith is, but R.J. says he's not supposed to say. Daryl sees that her bag isn't packed. He asks where she went, but R.J. doesn't budge and pretends to not know. Daryl goes out to look for her. He meets up with Carol who says they'll find her. He comments that he's not a very good parent and asks what Rick would do. Carol says when 
Sophia
 was born, she had no idea what she was doing except that she loved her. Carol reassures Daryl he'll figure it all out eventually.

The angry crowd continues to be difficult. As Max is running away, she then sees the previously-killed cleaning crew members now reanimated, causing panic amongst the citizens as they flee the festival. Sebastian continues to chase after Max. The walkers lunge at and bite many civilians along the way. Mercer radios all units to the square and order six soldiers to come with him. Pamela protests that Mercer is supposed to protect her, but he answers that he's supposed to protect the Commonwealth. Ezekiel, Carol, and 
Nabila
 flee the scene with the children.

What's Been Lost
"


At 
Elodie's Treats
, Carol loads up a bag with food when 
Ezekiel
 joins her, leading to some playful banter between the two. Ezekiel offers Carol some extra medical supplies to take back to 
Alexandria
 with her which she is grateful for, explaining that she was just taking some more food to meet up with the others. Carol turns around for a moment to grab some more rolls and when she turns back, Ezekiel has mysteriously disappeared. Two men enter the bakery and attack Carol, but she manages to escape out the back door.

Carol sneaks through the streets, dodging two patrolling 
soldiers
 and hiding until her pursuers have gone past. Once they're gone, Carol runs back the way that she came. Arriving at the 
Coalition
's wagon, Carol finds it abandoned with supplies strewn around and a trail of blood. Hearing the sounds of a fight from a nearby building, Carol moves to investigate. Inside, 
Daryl
 is being strangled by an attacker who has already been stabbed by him in the shoulder, while a third man lies dead nearby, having been killed by Daryl in the fight. As the man shrugs off all of Daryl's desperate attacks, his partner begins to reanimate and Carol hits him over the head from behind, saving Daryl's life. Grabbing his remaining knife, Daryl prepares to fight the man again, before his zombified partner rises up and bites the man in the neck from behind. Taking advantage of the distraction, Daryl stabs both men in the head, killing them, and retrieves his other knife. Recovering, Daryl tells Carol that they took the kids, but Carol corrects him that everyone has been taken.

Daryl tells Carol that he was jumped and that the attackers even took 
Dog
. Daryl thinks that the attackers were working for Pamela and they need to find 
Mercer
 for help. However, Carol worries that Mercer would possibly turn them in, meaning that he can't be trusted. 
"Shit. There is one other person,"
 realizes Carol and Daryl guesses that she's talking about 
Lance Hornsby
. Carol points out that Lance knows all of the dark shit that's going on in the Commonwealth, so he'd probably know about this. While Carol knows where to find Lance, this isn't going to be easy.

In the 
Commonwealth Jail
, Daryl and Carol subdue two guards and take their 
guns
 and keys. Carol locates Lance's cell where they find the traumatized and blood-covered Lance muttering in the corner about how 
"there's always a path. Always a way out,"
 while staring at his lucky coin, a zombified 
Sebastian
 laying amongst 
Roman Calhoun
's dismembered remains. Although shocked by this scene, Daryl draws one of his knives and stabs Sebastian in the head, putting him down. Choking Lance up against the wall, Daryl demands to know where their friends have been taken and presses on Lance's 
facial wound
. Seeing Lance's state, Carol stops Daryl and tells Lance that they can't leave him there alive, so his options are telling them where their friends are or dying.

Finally focusing on Carol, Lance agrees to show them, stating that he gets that they don't trust him, but Lance knows a way out of the city and the two agree. However, Daryl spots an ankle monitor on Lance and he explains that it'll set off an alarm if Lance leaves. Daryl goes to cut it off, but Lance tells him that he'll have to cut off his foot and carry him. Instead, Carol tells Lance to be ready to run, but he stops them to do something first. Alarms ring through the jail as the three make a run for an exit. 
Commonwealth soldiers
 shoot at Daryl, Carol and Lance and Daryl returns fire, ordering Carol to leave with Lance while he covers them. Daryl promises Carol that he will figure it out and he continues to exchange fire with the soldiers as Carol and Lance escape. It's later revealed that Lance had bashed open Sebastian's head and left his lucky coin behind in Sebastian's spilled brains as a final message to 
Pamela
.

Outside of the Commonwealth, Carol asks Lance how much farther they have to go, and he tells her that it's just a couple of miles further up. Looking back at the city, Lance comments that he's never realized before just how much the Commonwealth looks like a prison from the outside. Lance calls Carol right to have left Daryl behind as Daryl was only slowing her down just like everyone does. Carol asks what Lance means and he explains that Carol isn't like most people and she's always thinking 10 steps ahead which is what makes her special, bringing up the impossible jailbreak that Carol had pulled with obvious respect for her talents. Lance claims that he hopes that Daryl's okay, and Carol turns her gun on him, aware that Lance is just trying to manipulate her. Lance insists that he's being honest, and that he can take her to her friends, but Carol is doubtful that Lance really cares what happens to Daryl. Lance points out that he was just locked in a cell and forced to feed his colleague piece by piece to Sebastian, so he might not be moving at full speed currently. Their standoff is interrupted by the approach of two Commonwealth motorcycles and a jeep that stop nearby and let out four soldiers that begin searching the tree line for the escapees. Lance suggests to Carol a way for losing the patrol and he leads her away.

At night, Lance leads Carol to a tunnel, explaining that it was an infrastructure repair project dating back from the early days of the Commonwealth. However, it was considered to be too unstable after a series of cave-ins. Lance insists that he meant what he had said about hoping that Daryl's alright as it's hard to find someone like that that you'd do anything for. Lance bitterly tells Carol that he had felt that way about Pamela once and thought that he could make her feel the same way about him by helping her to build and run the Commonwealth, letting Pamela take all of the credit, even by bringing in the Coalition which Lance admits he mishandled. However, it was never enough for Pamela and Lance knew that there was nothing that he could do that would change how she saw him. To Pamela, Lance will always be just her chauffer's son. Lance asks Carol what will come after the unrest in the Commonwealth, pointing out that, if Pamela doesn't survive it, a power vacuum will be opened up. In history, when that happens, the people who suffer the most in revolutions are the civilians. Carol asks for Lance's point, and he tells her that Carol and her people will hold 50,000 lives in their hands, but for Carol there isn't an after until she finds her people. Lance knows Carol and that she'll find them, but she'll then have a choice on whether or not to let the Commonwealth burn afterwards. Carol calls it not her problem, and Lance states that he gets that Carol wants to leave all of this behind her, claiming that he wants that too, but he asks if she's really going to deny the kids the kind of life that they took for granted and doesn't the next generation deserve better than the one before.

Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by a terrible smell and Carol and Lance spotting skin on a nearby oil drum. A partially skinned walker grabs Lance and pulls him to the ground and, while helping to free Lance, Carol's flashlight is knocked away in the struggle. Another walker attacks Carol from behind and she manages to put it down as Lance finally gets himself free. Hearing a number of walker growls, Carol quickly realizes that she's surrounded by a whole 
herd
 and opens fire with her stolen rifle, putting them all down after a struggle with a single walker whose skin is ripped off as they fight. Throughout the fight, Lance holds the flashlight on Carol, and he claims that when the lights went out, he thought that Carol was right behind him.

Hearing the approach of more walkers, Carol and Lance quickly flee from the tunnel, only to encounter a Commonwealth patrol outside. The lead trooper issues orders that they will tell command that they had found the pair, but they put up a fight, so the soldiers had to put them down. However, Daryl drops down from where he was hiding under the patrol's jeep and shoots the soldiers from behind with Carol rushing in to finish off one that was only just wounded with her knife to the head. Watching this, Lance just shakes his head at Carol in amazement.

On a hill overlooking a 
train depot
, Daryl reports on the two guards walking the perimeter in shifts and Lance figures that it shouldn't be a problem to take them out for Daryl and Carol and they will then head for their friends. While the tracks fork a few times along the way, Lance knows the route that the supply train takes to get there. Daryl and Carol are surprised to learn that the Commonwealth has a working train and Lance explains that it was part of a plan to expand the Commonwealth's reach, connecting communities across the continent to the sea, although Carol figures that the Commonwealth's intentions were to conquer the communities, not connect them. Daryl reveals to Lance that they intend to leave him behind as they no longer need Lance's help. Daryl and Carol can now simply wait for the train to come and then see where it goes. Lance insists that they still need his help, reminding Carol that they had talked about this: not burning the Commonwealth down and building a better future for the children and everyone else. While Carol admits that she did hear Lance, it was only because he didn't leave her with another choice with his refusal to shut up. Lance expands upon his ideas for how they can work together to build the Commonwealth into a better place, but Daryl and Carol are uninterested in Lance's manipulations.

Daryl and Carol offer Lance the chance to leave and go into exile which Daryl points out is more than Lance deserves after everything that he's done. Lance acknowledges that he's made mistakes, but Lance insists that that's not who he is anymore and that the guy who did those terrible things died back in his cell while this Lance won't survive out here, but Daryl doesn't care after everything that Lance has put them through while Carol suggests that Lance is smart enough to possibly survive. Daryl and Carol refuse to hear anything more and Lance moves as if to leave. However, Lance suddenly grabs a rifle from the back of their stolen jeep and takes aim at Daryl and Carol, prompting Carol to shoot Lance in the neck with an arrow, mortally wounding him. With barely a glance at their fallen enemy, Daryl and Carol drive off, leaving Lance to choke to death on his own blood.



"
Outpost 22
"


On a hillside, 
Daryl
 and Carol observe several Commonwealth soldiers at a siding by the 
Commonwealth Train Depot
 that 
Lance Hornsby
 had led them to. The train arrives, carrying two Commonwealth jeeps and motorcycles and Carol asks if they can follow it without being seen. Daryl thinks that if they hang back far enough, they'll be fine before a jeep arrives carrying a captive 
Connie
. Seeing one of the soldiers talk into a radio, Carol turns on their own stolen radio and they overhear the soldier report that he has to put an exile on the train despite it being a cargo transport and thus against regulations. Another man responds that it has been cleared from on high as Connie is going to be Designation 2 rather than a worker. The soldier is ordered to get her there safely, but the reaction of both men to the news makes it clear that Connie being Designation 2 isn't a good thing. Carol wonders what Designation 2 is while Daryl knows that they can't go get Connie as the soldiers will radio ahead and warn everybody. They need to find the kids first, but Daryl is clearly troubled by his inability to help Connie. Carol reassures her friend that they will follow the train to the others and bust them out all at once. Daryl watches the train leave with a conflicted look on his face.

Daryl and Carol follow the train in their stolen jeep, but they have trouble keeping up with its course. Carol has Daryl race ahead of it and they stop at 
a junction
 that the train is eventually going to hit where Carol suggests that they just sit tight until it does. However, Daryl doesn't think that he can do that and gets back in the jeep. Carol stops him from leaving, knowing that seeing Connie being taken aboard the train reminded them both of 
losing Connie
 in 
Alpha's Cave
. Carol reminds Daryl that Kelly had told them that 
"we can't save them if we're dead"
 when they thought that they had lost Connie. Carol is willing to follow Daryl's lead on this, but she worries that if they go it alone, they might just be making the same mistakes again. Daryl reluctantly concedes that Carol is right, and she takes his hand in comfort.

At Junction 7, Maggie tells Carol that the soldiers had just ripped Hershel away from her and she wasn't strong enough to stop them. Carol hands Maggie a canteen and Maggie states that she hates not knowing which is worse. Maggie breaks down crying, but Carol reassures her friend that this is not on Maggie, and she is just one person, but Maggie continues to blame herself. Hugging Maggie, Carol tells her that she barely saw Daryl or anyone else when she got her new job at the Commonwealth. They were just doing their own thing and the Commonwealth is like the old world. Back then, they never would've spoken to each other, but they were all forced to become family after the fall which is a good thing and a gift that's held even in the Commonwealth. Carol points out that 
Pamela
's forces had to come at them while they were separated, meaning that they scare the shit out of Pamela. Pamela failed, they are not alone anymore, and they are going to make it right. 
Rosita
 and 
Gabriel
 join the two women, explaining that they'd heard a train and followed it.

Inside, Daryl lowers Nelson to the ground against a wall and checks his wound. Recognizing that it's mortal, Daryl tells Nelson that he's running out of time, and he asks the other man to do something good with the time that he has left and tell him where the train is going and what Designation 2 means as one of Daryl's friends was put on it with that designation. Coughing up blood and in pain, Nelson doesn't respond to Daryl's questions. Daryl tells Nelson that he was like him once: he joined the force because his family needed money which Daryl guesses is Nelson's motivation as well. Turning violent when Nelson continues to remain silent, Daryl yells that the Commonwealth has taken his kids from him and he wants them back, going so far as to kick the dying man. Entering, Carol tells Daryl that the train is going to be here soon, and Daryl suggests that they can hurry, drawing his knife and he offers Nelson the choice of dying quick or screaming.

Gabriel recognizes Nelson as a man from 
his church
 who was there every Sunday at the back pew closest to the door. Nelson would always come a little late and leave a little early, and it had seemed like Nelson had wanted to talk about something. Nelson asks if God forgives people like him, but Gabriel doesn't know, although he wishes that he did. Nelson admits that he's torn up all of the time with guilt and shame. Gabriel states that it's because Nelson's a coward, but that's alright as he's trying not to be. Gabriel knows that fear can drive people to do things that bring shame, but it can also push them into the light. Nelson is trying to do the right thing now which God sees and so does everyone else. Nelson tearfully wishes that he'd talked to Gabriel sooner which Gabriel wishes too. Nelson coughs up blood and Daryl nods to Gabriel who tells Nelson that 
"people remember the last thing that you do. The end of each story is very important. How do you want yours to end?"
 Nelson finally reveals that the Commonwealth punishes exiles by making them do hard labor and their friends are on railway duty. However, Nelson doesn't know where as he was only called out when they escaped, and they have to follow the train to find their friends. Addressing Daryl, Nelson states that he's only heard rumors about Designation 2 with the rumors stating that the Designation 2s are taken far away and they are never seen again. Daryl leaves and Gabriel agrees to pray with Nelson while he goes. Carol leaves at Gabriel's request and he sits down and prays with the dying man.

A few minutes later, Gabriel emerges carrying a bloody knife, having stabbed Nelson in the head to keep him from reanimating after he died. Daryl tells his friends that Connie's gone if the train pulls in, but Rosita worries that if the train sees them coming, they're going to radio ahead and the best way for them to get the kids is for the Commonwealth to not know they're coming. Daryl refuses to just leave Connie on the train and Carol tells him that she has an idea about how to do both.

The train arrives at the junction where 
Trooper 192
 emerges and puts down a walker before trying to move the junction switch which is stuck. 
Wilson
 attempts to let Outpost 22 know that they have a stuck junction switch and that it will take a few minutes to dislodge it, but he receives no response as Trooper 192 puts down another walker that emerges from the woods. Entering the cab, Maggie orders Wilson to put down the radio at gunpoint. Daryl and Carol sneak along the side of the train, putting down an approaching walker before ducking as an annoyed 
Jones
 asks his fellow soldier how hard it can be and Trooper 192 challenges him to come over so he can show Jones. Spotting a 
herd
 emerging from the woods and coming down the tracks, Jones orders 
Trooper 301
 and 
Trooper 263
 to cover the woods and the flank respectively.

Daryl and Carol crawl under the train as Jones jumps off the side, puts down a walker and goes to join Trooper 192 at the junction switch. In the woods, Trooper 301 finishes clearing the woods of walkers and calls in that the woods are cleared and she's heading back. Rosita and Gabriel ambush the soldier, disarming and killing her quietly so as not to draw notice from the other soldiers. Jones attempts to move the junction switch without success, and takes a closer look, realizing that someone had purposefully jammed it.

Alarmed, Jones orders everyone to get back there now, but Daryl opens fire before anyone can respond, killing Trooper 263. As Daryl and Carol take cover on the train, Jones and Trooper 192 each come down one side of the train, engaging in a gunfight with Daryl and Carol. Maggie emerges from the train cab and shoots Trooper 192 dead from behind. Daryl proceeds down the side, only to have Jones emerge with Connie as a hostage. Jones forces Daryl to disarm himself and, after Daryl admits that they had disabled the train's long-range antenna, Jones demands to know exactly what they did to it. While the soldier is distracted by Daryl, Connie breaks free and Jones takes off running through the train, chased by Daryl after he makes sure that Connie's alright. Jones takes one of the motorcycles being transported on the train and flees while Carol helps Connie to her feet. Leaving his friends to deal with the approaching herd, Daryl takes the other motorcycle and chases after Jones who crashes his motorcycle after going off-road with it in an attempt to avoid Daryl. Sliding his motorcycle under a fallen tree, Daryl hits Jones, sending him to the ground and knocking the man's helmet off. Daryl stabs Jones in the head, killing him.

Carol, Maggie, Gabriel and Rosita lead Wilson into the building where he refuses to help, stating that he's dead if he helps them. Wilson is shocked to see Nelson's dead body and Maggie warns the man that he's dead if he doesn't help them. Wilson explains that his family lives at a nearby outpost and if 
the Warden
 finds out that he helped them, Wilson will end up just like their friends. Rosita explains that the Commonwealth took their children and asks about the family that Wilson had mentioned before suggesting that Nelson had a family too. After a moment, Wilson tells them that there's a map in the train's engine room. Maggie and Carol take Wilson to get the map. Daryl returns and reunites with Connie, admitting in sign language that he was afraid that he wasn't going to see her again. Connie reassures Daryl that she's not going anywhere, causing Daryl to chuckle.

Suddenly, Daryl and Connie hear the sound of Wilson shouting at Maggie and Carol and rush over to see him holding a tool to his own throat while the two women try to talk him down. Wilson is terrified that the Warden will kill his wife and two sons if he helps them. Carol offers that if Wilson helps them, they will injure him, nothing serious, just enough to make it look like the engineer had barely gotten away from them and Wilson can tell the Warden that he escaped. However, Wilson believes that the Warden will know that he lied, torture him once he does and then kill Wilson's family. Despite Carol's efforts to talk him down, Wilson drives the tool through his neck, 
killing himself
 in order to spare his family from the Warden's vengeance.

Connie asks Daryl if they don't know which way to go which he confirms. Connie knows that Kelly is at Outpost 22 and scared and Connie can't lose her. Daryl promises Connie that they will find Kelly and Rosita suggests getting the train's long-range radio working again. Agreeing with the plan, the group heads back to the train to get the radio working again.

At night, posing as Trooper 301, Rosita radios in to Outpost 22, claiming that the train was overtaken and she's lost in the woods with the group still looking for her and she needs to get back to the site. Finally, a 
friendly soldier
 responds and Rosita identifies her location as Junction 7, stating that she's the last one left. The woman begins giving Rosita direction from Junction 7 to Outpost 22. The soldier informs Rosita that they don't have any spare units to send out her way for a pickup as they have a convoy coming in for colonial processing on Pamela's orders. 
"Word is that most of the processes used to live here before the Commonwealth claimed the territory and turned it into an outpost, back when it was still called 
Alexandria
."
 The soldier tells Rosita that the Warden will debrief her when she arrives and to shoot to kill if she has to engage any hostiles. The group is stunned by the revelation that Outpost 22 is actually Alexandria and Daryl informs Connie of this development. 
"Milton has underestimated us since day one. We are gonna get our kids, take back our home, and make it right. And Pamela is never gonna see it coming,"
 Maggie declares to her friends who are filled with new determination.

At the railroad tracks just outside of 
Alexandria
, the 
Commonwealth
 prisoners work under the supervision of 
the Warden
 and his 
soldiers
. 
Negan
 and 
Kelly
 observe the patterns of their captors with Kelly communicating her observations to 
Magna
 in sign language. Working with 
Ezekiel
, 
Princess
 recognizes the missing 
Tyler Davis
 amongst the other prisoners from their brief 
imprisonment
 in the 
rail yard
 before he 
later
 took 
Max
 hostage and then 
mysteriously vanished
. While Princess doesn't like Tyler, she knows that he's ballsy and that might be useful to them.

As Negan gets a drink, Magna discreetly reports what Kelly had told him about the locations of the soldiers which Negan sketches out. Ezekiel approaches Negan and asks for the map, but Negan spots 
Annie
 nearby and, ignoring Ezekiel, approaches 
Roberts
 and offers to pick up a couple of extra shifts so that his wife can have her workload loosened. Negan appeals to Roberts personally who appears to consider it before they are interrupted by 
Sanborn
. After being told that Negan is mouthing off, Sanborn decides that they need to show him his place and hits Negan with the butt of his 
rifle
. Negan attacks Sanborn, but he is knocked to the ground by Roberts and kicked in the gut. Seeing her husband's predicament, Annie rushes in to intervene and shoved to the ground by Sanborn and is dragged away with him after a brief scuffle as Roberts keeps Negan from intervening at gunpoint. Hidden in the bushes nearby, a worried 
Daryl
 and Carol observe these proceedings.

Outside of Alexandria, Daryl reports that the situation is really bad and he's not sure that any of their friends are going to make it. 
Gabriel
 asks if they saw everyone and Carol clarifies that they only saw the adults and that there was no sign of 
Coco
, 
Hershel
 and the other kids. Both 
Maggie
 and 
Rosita
 are concerned by this with Rosita wanting to go in immediately. Daryl, acting as 
Connie
's sign language interpreter so that she understands their conversation, tells the others that they can't go in as there are too many guards and they'll never make it. Gabriel is furious that Pamela had turned their home into a prison after promising to give it back, but Maggie realizes that Pamela had never actually intended to give it back. Daryl comes up with the idea of going in through the 
sewers
 and Connie volunteers to go with him while Carol knows a way back into their old house, but she needs some backup just in case the guards blocked it. Maggie decides to go with Carol and Daryl orders them to head for the windmill where a sewer grate is. Rosita wants to go with them too, refusing to stay outside while Coco is inside, but Carol reminds Rosita that she and Gabriel are their best sharpshooters if it comes to that. Carol promises to keep in touch in case something goes wrong, and Rosita reluctantly agrees, although she will come in if takes more than a night. Daryl hands Gabriel his gun and the group separates to enact their plan.

Daryl and Connie enter the sewers and Carol informs them over the radio that they made it and are good which Daryl confirms is the same for him and Connie. Daryl passes on the news to Connie who looks for reassurance that this will work. In another part of the sewers, Carol and Maggie find the correct ladder and emerge in the basement of one of the houses. The two women sneak through the house, avoiding the Commonwealth soldiers moving around. When one soldier spots Carol and Maggie, they quickly subdue him before he can raise an alarm.

Hiding in a small kitchen with the unconscious soldier as Commonwealth troops move around outside, Maggie breaks down, telling Carol that she keeps thinking that she hears Hershel's voice, and she wants to be and do better. However, sometimes Maggie thinks that it wasn't even fair to bring Hershel into this world. Maggie wonders if she was being selfish and Carol reassures her that she wasn't. Carol had felt that way too after losing 
Sophia
 and 
Henry
, but Carol didn't and doesn't believe it to be true. Carol asks if it's selfish of her to miss her children so much that she wants them to come back, and Maggie agrees that it's not. Maggie will always try to make the world better because of and for her son and that's hope. Carol promises her friend that they're going to find Hershel. Suddenly, the two women hear banging and faint calls for help.

That night, taking advantage of the soldiers being distracted by the 
rebellion
, Maggie and Carol race through the house, following Hershel's cries for help. Carol kills the soldier guarding Hershel and Maggie is finally reunited with her son. Rosita rushes in looking for her daughter who they can't find despite checking all of the other houses. However, Coco isn't with Hershel, and he doesn't know where she is.



"
Family
"


In a reclaimed 
Alexandria
, the 
Coalition
 recover their various weapons from a large crate full of weapons confiscated by 
the Commonwealth
.

In front of the windmill, 
Rosita
 passes the corpses of 
Sanborn
 and 
the Warden
, grabbing an extra clip for her gun off of Sanborn's belt. 
Gabriel
 asks 
Tyler Davis
 if there's anything that he knows that can help them find the missing children and Tyler reveals that, when he was a soldier, kids without parents would end up at the 
Commonwealth Children's Home
. However, Tyler doesn't know where it is, so he goes to get the location from the captured 
Commonwealth soldiers
 at Gabriel's request. Rosita impatiently calls for the Coalition soldiers and freed prisoners to board the Commonwealth's transport bus. 
Princess
 asks 
Magna
 if anyone actually knows how to drive a train, but Magna reassures her that one of the prisoners apparently used to be an engineer before they board the bus, with 
Kelly
, 
Connie
, 
Adrienne
 and 
Dianne
 amongst those joining them.

As 
Maggie
 loads the back of the bus, 
Negan
 asks how she plans to take out 
Pamela Milton
. Negan gets that others have their own reasons for going back to the Commonwealth, but as far as he's concerned, none of them are safe as long as Pamela's still alive which he guesses that Maggie agrees with. Negan suggests that they can take out Pamela together without the help of the others, but Maggie closes the bus door and walks away, telling Negan that 
"we're not a we."
 In front of the bus, Maggie hugs 
Hershel
 and says a tearful goodbye to her son. 
Annie
 hugs Negan from behind and orders her husband to be careful. Negan states that he always is, and Annie tells Negan to come back in one piece while she holds down the fort in Alexandria and Negan promises to do so.

Nearby, 
Ezekiel
 says goodbye to 
Nabila
, 
Aliyah
 and 
Gracie
 while 
Daryl
 promises R.J. that they will be back soon and orders him to look after Judith. However, Judith tells Daryl and Carol that she's coming too over Daryl's objections. Judith reminds her friends that this isn't the future that Carl wanted and it's not what Rick and Michonne fought for, not yet at least. What they're doing could help everyone, maybe everybody everywhere, not just them. Judith wants to be a part of making what her family believed in real. Carol recognizes that while everyone else has been focused on the present for a long time, Judith has been thinking about the future which is a good thing and something that they could all do a little more of. Daryl agrees on the condition that Judith stays right with him, and he leaves R.J. in Nabila's care while they're gone.

On the railroad tracks, the Commonwealth's train smashes a walker to bits. Inside, observed by Daryl, Carol, Maggie and Judith, Rosita pours over a map of the Commonwealth with Gabriel, telling him that once they get inside, they will move the former prisoners into hiding and, as they hopefully get Mercer on their side to take out Pamela, she and Gabriel will go to get 
Coco
 back. Gabriel notices that they're going in through the lower ward and wonders why they're not going in through 
the Estates
 instead. Rosita points out that with more money, the Estates have more patrols, meaning that they don't stand out as much in the lower wards. They're going to use an access road that will allow them to hit the children's home from behind. Gabriel smiles at Rosita and promises her that they will get Coco back which is his faith in Rosita talking and Rosita is glad that Gabriel is with her.

A concerned Judith tells Daryl and Carol that she hasn't heard from Michonne in a long time. While Judith had tried to reach her mother a few times, she was unsuccessful. Carol reassures Judith that there could be a lot of reasons for that and Michonne can take care of herself better than just about anyone that Carol knows. Daryl promises Judith that both Rick and Michonne would be very proud of their daughter. Judith asks if Carl would be proud of her too and Daryl nods while Carol tells Judith that she and Carl are a lot alike. Judith remembers that her brother had died saving people and she wishes that she'd had more time with Carl and that they have more time to just remember everyone that they've lost along the way. Carol promises that they will, and Daryl promises that, when this is over, he will tell Judith every story that he remembers about all of the people that loved her before pulling Judith into a hug.

Outside of the tunnel entrance, four Commonwealth soldiers patrol while the Coalition forces hide nearby. Negan tells the others that they are sitting ducks and Mercer isn't coming and they can't wait for him. Carol agrees that it's time for a new plan, but Princess is sure that Mercer is gonna show up. Daryl states that they're running out of time and Carol decides to head around and try to find another way to slip in. Maggie suggests that they could take the four guards, but Rosita warns her that if those guards go missing, the clock is going to start ticking on them. Judith draws the others attention as one of the guards notices something and starts heading their way. However, Lieutenant Rose calls in with orders from Mercer for the guards to report to the East Gate immediately to deal with the incoming herd. Lieutenant Rose confirms that that includes Tunnel H and he reassures the soldiers that the tunnel is locked, and they've got it covered on the other end. Complying with his orders, the guards move out. Breaking the lock on the door, the group makes their way into the tunnel.

The Coalition forces emerge from the tunnel in the seemingly-abandoned Union Station. Daryl quickly deduces that something isn't right, and he notices that the outer doors are all chained shut. Realizing that it's a trap, Daryl yells for everyone to get down as Pamela's private forces, situated on the station's balcony, open fire, killing Tyler and two former prisoners standing near him as everyone else dives for cover.

A gunfight erupts between Pamela's forces and the Coalition with Rosita desperately trying to get the doors open. One Alexandria resident crawls towards a hiding Connie, Kelly, Magna and Dianne, but he is shot in the head and killed by one of Pamela's men before he can reach them. As the gunfight continues, Pamela herself emerges and grabs a 
gun
 from one of her men who is killed by the Coalition. Pamela takes aim at Maggie, but Judith notices and shoves Maggie out of the way just in time, saving her life. Instead, Pamela accidentally shoots Judith, seriously wounding the young girl. Daryl desperately attends to Judith as Pamela watches in horror and the others increase their fire, killing a few more of Pamela's men. Yelling that 
"you did this,"
 Pamela retreats to her office. Looking for a way out, Daryl spots a 
fire extinguisher
 near Ezekiel and signals him to throw it. Grabbing Rick's Colt Python from Judith, Daryl shoots the fire extinguisher, creating a smokescreen.

In Union Square, 
Yumiko
 and 
Max
 observe the heavily guarded doors to Union Station from across the street. Hearing twigs snapping, Yumiko spots a hooded 
Eugene
 sneaking around a train car, armed with 
Brooks
' rifle and she tells Max that they are going to go around. Inside, under cover of the smokescreen, Daryl and the others manage to break the chains sealing a side door. As a trooper approaches the doors, Eugene ambushes him and knocks the man out with the butt of his rifle. Magna finally breaks through the doors, and everyone is reunited with Eugene, Yumiko and Max before quickly making their escape.

The Coalition races through the streets towards the 
hospital
 with Daryl carrying the unconscious Judith. Commonwealth vehicles drive up and block their path in multiple directions, forcing them to fall back. Carol realizes that the soldiers aren't following them as they begin to erect barricades in the streets. Loudly yelling and firing their guns in the air, Commonwealth soldiers lead the herd in their direction before closing the barricades, penning the herd and the Coalition in. Spotting a walker climbing over something, a shocked Negan asks 
"what the fuck?"
 As walkers close in from multiple directions, 
Luke
 and 
Jules
 emerge from the herd, causing Kelly to nearly shoot them before Connie stops her sister. Fleeing down a side street, Carol spots an alley near part of the herd and everyone attacks the walkers, clearing a path for Daryl to flee down the alley towards the hospital with Judith. Waking up for a moment, Judith calls out 
"daddy?"
 and witnesses her friends and loved ones struggling to hold back the herd before passing out again.



"
Rest in Peace
"


In the streets, the 
Coalition
 desperately fights off the 
herd
 as they try to escape from the walkers swarming around them, those armed with guns shooting the undead while the rest stab at them with knives, including 
Max
. However, 
Jules
 misses the head of one walker, instead stabbing it in the shoulder. The walker bites Jules in the arm and 
Luke
 rushes to his girlfriend's aid, stabbing the walker in the head and yelling for help as he supports Jules. However, walkers swarm the couple from behind with one tackling Luke to the ground and biting him in the leg as Jules is dragged down and devoured. Seeing Luke's predicament, 
Connie
 shoots the walker in the head and Luke is dragged to safety by 
Kelly
 and 
Yumiko
, yelling in desperation for his girlfriend as Jules is devoured, beyond the ability of any of her friends to try to save her. Shooting at a smaller group of walkers coming down an alleyway, Carol orders her friends to follow her down it and everyone flees as the herd overruns the streets.

At 
the hospital
, a bandaged and bruised 
Daryl
 regains consciousness in a bed with Carol at his side and 
Magna's group
 nearby desperately trying to save Luke's life, having 
amputated
 his bitten leg. Getting to his feet against Carol's objections, Daryl checks on a pale and unconscious 
Judith
 who is lying on a nearby stretcher, noting with concern that Judith has lost a lot of blood. Looking at their friends' desperate attempts to save the dying Luke, Carol informs Daryl that all of the doctors, nurses and medicine are gone, taken by 
Pamela Milton
 to where she's holed up in 
the Estates
, leaving the rest of 
the Commonwealth
 to fend for itself. Daryl decides that they need to get to the Estates, but Carol informs him that there's too many soldiers and they're hoping to find somebody who can get them in without a fight. Daryl suggests that 
Mercer
 can help as he knows people on the inside and Carol tells him that Max thinks so too and that there's a team after him while some of the others are looking for the missing kids with everyone planning to meet back at the hospital. Daryl hates the idea of just waiting, but Carol corrects him that they're going to take care of Daryl and Judith while the others are gone.

Near death from the bite and blood loss, Luke has his friends remove a harmonica that he's kept from his pocket and Yumiko promises him that they'll keep the music alive for him. With his last words, Luke asks everyone to promise him, and they all do so. Luke dies in his friends' arms as they all sob at losing him. Taking a knife from Kelly, 
Magna
 stabs Luke in the head to prevent him from reanimating and the group sobs over his corpse. Watching the others' grief, a determined Daryl decides to give Judith a blood transfusion, explaining that he's a universal donor and that 
Merle
 had used to make him sell his blood when he was a kid as a way of making money. Carol helps Daryl set up the transfusion as they watch the others cover Luke's body in a sheet. Hearing loud noise and shouting, Carol and the others leave to sweep the hospital for walkers and to make sure that the others are okay while Daryl remains with Judith.

A confused Judith wakes up and panics that she's going to die when Daryl informs her that Judith's at the hospital. Daryl tries to reassure Judith, but she feels like she's going to die, worrying that 
"
Mom
's gonna find Dad and we're gonna be together. We're all gonna be together,"
 but at the moment it feels like she's going to die instead. Although visibly shocked by the implication that 
Rick
's still alive, Daryl reassures Judith that she's going to be fine. Judith starts to quote something that Michonne had used to say to Rick, but she passes out again as banging and screaming sounds in the background. Reentering the room, Carol tells Daryl that walkers have breached the hospital and they have to go. As Daryl tries to wake Judith up, Rosita calls in with the news that her group is in the alley behind the hospital, but they wrecked their ambulance going through the herd which is now surrounded by walkers.

Daryl begins wheeling Judith's stretcher out, but stops after seeing walkers pounding on the glass at the front doors of the hospital. Disconnecting the blood transfusion, Daryl barricades Judith in the room and rushes to help in the lobby where walkers drag 
Adrienne
 outside and devour her while the group barricades the doors again. Looking at the numerous walkers outside of the windows, Carol and Daryl shocked to see a variant walker breaking the glass with a brick while Connie spots more walkers coming down the hallway from the other direction. The variant breaks through the glass and is immediately stabbed in the head by Carol, but more walkers break in from the other side and drag a man outside and devour him. With walkers converging from the three sides, the group attempts to fight them off, only to have more walkers break through the barricaded door as well. Racing down a clear hallway, the group grabs Judith's stretcher while Magna radios the others to warn them that the hospital has been breached and they're leaving out the back. The group races through the hospital towards an exit as walkers close in on them from multiple directions.

At night, outside of a loading dock, Mercer observes a crowd of desperate Commonwealth residents demanding to be let into the Estates. Mercer reassures Maggie that they will be able to move soon while Aaron tells Ezekiel that he saw people on the higher floors and rooftops begging for help, but he wanted to make sure that Lydia was safe first. Ezekiel reassures his friend that he did the right thing. Hearing screams in the distance, both men are determined to do more, but they need to take care of Judith first. Lieutenant 
Rose
 arrives in another truck and reports to Mercer that they're all set: everyone is in the back and there's no one to check. The doctors have set up a safe house, but they have to hurry. Mercer calls for everyone to go, stating that they need to get Judith to 
Tomi
. Everyone boards the truck with Princess, Max and Dianne pushing Judith's stretcher.

At the safe house in the Estates, Daryl lays Judith on a bed and Tomi immediately begins tending to her. Tomi informs Daryl that Judith is in a fragile state, but he did a good thing by giving her blood. Tomi promises to do what he can and enlists Ezekiel's help. Ezekiel orders the others to clear the room, promising to get them when Judith is stable. In another room, Aaron wraps up Lydia's stump and offers her some advice based on his own experience with losing an arm. Having learned of Luke and Jules' deaths, Lydia is upset and believes that the still-missing Elijah and Jerry are dead too. 
"That's just what happens. You know, people die. Cities fall. And things just don't work out. People tell me they do, but they don't."
 However, Aaron refuses to give up hope that their friends are still alive somewhere and he promises that they will find them both. A concerned Maggie enters, looking for Negan, but nobody has seen him in awhile.

Her injured arm now in a sling, Judith wakes up as Daryl and Carol watch over her, much to their relief. Judith admits that she doesn't feel great, but she's fine like Daryl had promised her. Daryl asks if what Judith had said about Rick and Michonne was true, and Judith reveals that it's why Michonne had never returned. Daryl and Carol are stunned by this, and Judith apologizes for not telling them earlier, having been afraid that Daryl would leave too if he knew that Rick is still alive somewhere. Daryl reassures Judith that he's still there, before they are interrupted by shouts outside and two gunshots. Looking outside, Mercer sees a man trying to climb the wall, only to be shot by Commonwealth soldiers on Pamela's orders. Mercer tells the others that the soldiers are shooting anyone that climbs the gates and grabs a gun, unwilling to just stand by as people are dying. Mercer informs the Coalition members that the truck is gassed up with enough reserves in the rear to get them home. Mercer and his men can sneak them out the back as Mercer believes that this isn't their fight or their people. 
"Yes, they are. And so are you,"
 states Ezekiel. Addressing the others, Ezekiel tells them that 
"you may not think this place is worth saving, and I get that, given how they treated us. But it's worth it to me. The people are worth it, and I'm not gonna allow them to fall without a fight. Not today. I'm with you. Who else?"
 Aaron immediately agrees, stating that they can do more than just save themselves and they need to. Following Ezekiel's lead, everyone agrees to fight to save the Commonwealth.

At the gates of the Estates, the crowd desperately begs Pamela to be let in, amongst them 
Mr. Martens
, 
Mrs. Martens
 and 
Mei
. On a balcony, Maggie lines up her shot on Pamela, but Negan tells her to hold on as Mercer and his loyalist forces move in, ordering Colonel 
Vickers
 and her men to lower their weapons. Pamela orders Vickers to arrest them, but the Coalition forces join Mercer's troops from another angle, creating a standoff. Pamela accuses Mercer of being a traitor, but Mercer states that she's the true traitor and lists Pamela's crimes: disappearing hundreds of citizens, leading the dead to their doorstep, shooting a child and now leaving thousands to die.

The banging on the gates grows more frantic as the herd begins to approach the Estates, meaning that the people will die if they're not let inside. Gabriel moves towards the gates despite Vickers orders to stop. Gabriel announces that they're opening the gate and letting everyone inside, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him. Vickers threatens to shoot him, but Carol warns her that they will fire back if she does. Pamela orders her men to shoot Gabriel as he reaches the gates and one of them points a gun at his head. Suddenly, Daryl yells for them to stop. 
"What the hell you doing?"
 Daryl demands. 
"We all deserve better than this. You built this place to be like the old world. That was the fuckin' problem."
 Pamela states that if she opens the gates, the dead will get in too, not just the living. Daryl tells her that if she doesn't, Pamela will lose everything anyway. 
"We got one enemy. We ain't the walking dead."


Realizing that Daryl is right, Vickers orders everyone to lower their weapons and give Gabriel the key to the gates. Everyone stands down and Vickers defers to Mercer's command who places Pamela under arrest for high crimes against the people of the Commonwealth. As everyone rushes to help let the people in, Maggie informs Negan that Pamela is getting arrested and Negan tells her that prison is a fate worse than death for someone like Pamela, causing Maggie to relent in shooting her.

The crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in 
Alexandria
 and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified 
Lance Hornsby
, Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of 
suicide
. Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rife, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back.

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates.

Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

Sitting in a jail cell, Pamela tells Daryl and Carol that it's not easy to have so many lives in your hands. You will have to make ugly decisions such as picking who will do the jobs that no one wants and who gets the nicer house. Carol tells Pamela that they've already had to make an ugly decision by keeping Pamela alive even after everything that she's done because they've all done things. Carol promises Pamela that they will figure it out and Carol will make sure of it. Pausing on her way out, Carol quips that 
"at least we don't have to worry about who gets your house."
 Daryl and Carol leave and Mercer locks the cell, leaving Pamela facing a lifetime in prison for her crimes.

In Alexandria, everyone enjoys a celebration and feast, joined by Mercer, Max and Tomi. Judith gives 
Dog
 some of her food and Yumiko raises a toast to Luke. Looking out the window, Daryl sees Negan walking away and the two men exchange a smile and a nod, parting on good terms. Yumiko turns to Magna, telling her 
"same"
 and Magna kisses her, the two women resuming their romantic relationship. Sitting down, Rosita smiles as she watches the celebration before becoming somber. Noticing Rosita's somber mood, Gabriel joins her, and Rosita tells him that she just wants to remember this perfect moment. In a whisper, Rosita reveals her bite and impending death to Gabriel. Noticing Rosita's behavior and crying, Judith realizes that something's wrong with her and becomes upset, apparently deducing the truth.

Weak and near death, Rosita is led to bed by Maggie and Carol where Coco is laying. With everyone now aware that Rosita's dying, a tearful Maggie gives her a hug and kiss goodbye and Carol hugs her before the two women leave. As Daryl watches from the doorway, a barely composed Gabriel performs Last Rites over Rosita. Rosita kisses Coco for a final time and Gabriel promises that they will see her again someday. Gabriel carries Coco out as Eugene takes a seat next to Rosita's bed. Eugene tearfully tells Rosita that he wouldn't be the man that he is today if he hadn't met her. Taking Eugene's hand, Rosita tells him that she's glad that it was him in the end who will be there to make sure that she won't reanimate after she's gone. Rosita peacefully passes away with her oldest living friend at her side and Eugene breaks down completely.

A year later, Daryl and Carol, who is now wearing her hair short again as she did before Rick's disappearance, look at the old memorial wall of the people that the community had lost. Alexandria has been fully rebuilt and is thriving again with the residents enjoying everyday life together. Aaron, Gabriel, Coco, and 
Gracie
 greet Lydia, Elijah, Judith and 
RJ
 and Lydia gives Gabriel a package from Father 
Grant
 and his 
old congregation
. Daryl and Carol join them while Jerry and 
Nabila
, walking through town as their daughters play outside, smile at them. Aaron admits that he never thought that they'd get back to any of this, although he had hope. Aaron calls them all very lucky, but Gabriel corrects Aaron that it's effort rather than luck. They have a lot to be proud of in their family, community, and future.

The group from the Commonwealth next visits a rebuilt and thriving 
Hilltop
 where Maggie and Hershel watch as Adam plays. Carol asks Maggie what she had wanted to talk about, and Maggie reveals that she wants to talk about the future. 
"There's a lot out there to find out about. And I think it's time we did."


Sitting on a bench next to a river in the Commonwealth, Carol calls it a beautiful day to head out. Daryl wishes that Carol was coming with him which Carol agrees with, but she feels that this is going to be good for both of them. Daryl tells Carol that he's proud of her, she has taken Lance's job, made it her own and made everything better for her and the kids and Carol will keep making everything better. Carol becomes emotional, telling Daryl that he will too, and Daryl reminds Carol that it's not like they won't ever see each other again. Crying, Carol tells Daryl that she's allowed to be a little sad and that he's her best friend and Daryl holds her.

At the side of the road, Judith, RJ and Ezekiel join Daryl and Carol as he prepares to depart on his motorcycle. Daryl hugs the kids and RJ promises him that he will be good while Judith promises to keep an eye on Dog for him. Daryl asks Judith to keep an eye on Carol and promises her that if he sees or hears anything about Rick and Michonne while he's out there, he will find them both and bring them home. Calling him Uncle Daryl, Judith states that Daryl deserves a happy ending too and Daryl promises to come back. Daryl hugs Ezekiel goodbye and he leads the kids to the top of the wall to watch Daryl's departure. Daryl and Carol hug and admit that they love each other before Daryl drives off on his motorcycle through the Commonwealth gate, setting off through the countryside on his new journey.

. The 
radio operator
 hopes that Carol is found quickly as the connection usually only lasts for a few minutes and they've been at this for awhile. Just as Daryl is about to give up, Carol finally comes on the line, surprised to hear from her friend. Daryl reassures Carol that he's okay, and explains that since he has access to a radio, he thought that he'd try to reach out to her. Daryl tells Carol that he's in 
Maine
 by the coast and he asks if everything is good back home. Carol tells him that everything is pretty quiet which takes some getting used to, but Daryl expresses concern about if Carol is really alright. Carol promises her friend that he never has to worry about her, and asks how it is out there. Daryl promises to tell Carol when he sees her, revealing that he's just gathering some fuel and he will be home in about a week.

man
 rides Daryl's motorcycle as a car catches up to him. The car chases after the rider who stops and shoots out the car's engine, ordering the driver to get out with their hands up once the car has stopped. Carol emerges from her disabled car, explaining that she's looking for a friend of hers named 
Daryl Dixon
. Despite riding Daryl's motorcycle, the rider claims to have never heard of him. The rider tells Carol that he found it, but Carol asks if the man is sure about that because Carol has come a long way trying to track Daryl down.

"
Moulin Rouge
"


Trailing smoke, 
Ash's Plane
 lands in a field in 
Greenland
. Getting out of the plane, 
Ash
 accidentally knocks a 
Flare Gun
 out onto the wing and he puts it on the floor just inside of the door. Ash grabs what he needs to repair the plane's busted fuel line and admits that he's surprised that they're still alive. Carol spots a small 
herd
 of three walkers approaching and instructs Ash to work on the fuel leak while she takes care of the walkers. Walking closer, Carol shoots two of them with 
Daryl's Crossbow
, but before she can shoot the third one, a 
lurker
 pops up out of the ground and grabs Carol, yanking her off of her feet. Struggling to keep the lurker off of her, Carol draws 
her knife
, but a second lurker pops up out of the ground behind her and restrains Carol's hand. Carol yells for Ash and manages to kick the first lurker off of her. Ash comes to her rescue, bashing the second lurker over the head with a pipe wrench, allowing Carol to stab the first one. The final walker grabs Ash, but it's shot from a distance by 
Hanna
. 
"Welcome to Greenland,"
 calls 
Eun
. Ash is excited to see other survivors, but Carol is more wary of the new people.

Walking through the hills in Greenland, Eun introduces herself and Hanna and Ash thanks the two women for their help. Hanna tells them that it wasn't the best landing spot as the field is full of Tupilag which is what they call the walkers after an old Inuit myth. In mythology, Tupliag is a flesh-eating beast conjured up to take 
revenge
 on its enemy and if it can't find them, then Tupilag returns home to kill its maker. Eun notes that Carol and Ash are the first people that they've seen in years, and they thought that they were dreaming when they heard the plane. Ash explains that there's a crack in the fuel lines, meaning that it was more like a nightmare for them. Ash can fix it if he can find the right supplies and Eun is sure that they've got something that he'll be able to use. Reaching the top of a hill, Hanna points to a 
research station
 in the distance.

The two women lead Carol and Ash to the research station and show them the reindeer that they have cooking. Eun shows Ash to the storeroom to look for supplies while Hanna offers Carol a 
drink
, although she refuses. Hanna explains that she and Eun came to the research station to do climate research for their PhDs, tracking glacier melt. It was only supposed to be for three months but, as Carol puts it, the world went to hell, and they got trapped there instead. However, Hanna doesn't think that the world went to hell. Instead, she suggests that the world is simply trying to heal itself to which Carol questions if the world healing itself involves killing everyone they love. 
"Weren't we already doing that to ourselves? Poisoning the Earth. One species, to serve its bottomless appetite, devours all the others. Tupilag is Mother Nature fighting back. Never screw with somebody's mother,"
 declares Hanna. Ash returns, having found some speed tape which should work, and Hanna suggests that he go ahead while she'll come along in awhile with some food that Carol and Ash can take with them. Carol offers her help which Hanna accepts, and Carol decides to take her up on that drink.

Carol and Hanna share a drink together and Carol asks the other woman about the seasonings for her broth. With Carol's permission, Hanna loads Daryl's crossbow as she talks and puts it on the table. Growing nervous and sensing that something isn't right, Carol picks up a pen to use as a makeshift weapon. Hanna turns the crossbow on Carol who tells her that Carol's parents taught her to never point a weapon at anyone and Hanna reveals that she is supposed to kill Carol, but she doesn't want to. However, Hanna lost the coin toss and reveals that while Eun won, she doesn't intend to kill Ash.

Carol tries to talk the visibly terrified Hanna down with Hanna confirming that she doesn't want to kill Carol and she's not a killer. However, Eun told her to do it, and Carol dying is what Eun wants. Carol asks what Hanna wants, but Hanna doesn't know, so Carol urges her to think about it, knowing that Hanna must want something. Hanna finally admits that she wants to get out of this place as it's killing her. Carol suggests that Hanna can come with them, but the other woman accuses Carol of just saying that to save her life. However, Carol is offering Hanna an opportunity to save her own life, asking her how often planes land outside of this shit hole. Hanna knows that Eun will never leave and she can't leave Eun, but Carol recognizing the abusive situation and herself a survivor of 
abuse
, urges the other woman to do what she wants to do, rather than what Eun wants her to do. 
"We go find Ash, we fix the plane, and we leave,"
 states Carol.

Eun returns alone and demands to know what the delay is, and Hanna tells her that she's getting around to it. Carol demands to know where Ash is, and Eun states that Ash is at the plane and he's fine. Eun demands to know what Hanna is waiting for as the other woman continues to hesitate to 
murder
 Carol who asks if Hanna is really going to listen to Eun who clearly doesn't listen to Hanna in return. Stating that she's done her part, Eun orders Hanna to do hers, but Hanna continues to hesitate. Frustrated, Eun yells that either Hanna does what she tells her or Eun will do it herself. Eun raises her gun to kill Carol, but Hanna shoots Eun in the head with 
Daryl's Crossbow
 instead, killing her. Carol reassures Hanna that she had no choice, and promises that she and Ash will still take Hanna with them.

At night, Carol and Hanna walk through the 
foggy
 field back towards the plane with walkers wandering around nearby. Hanna tells Carol not to hesitate to shoot if something moves. Hanna notes that Ash seems kind, and Carol tells her that Ash has been through a lot, so Hanna states that Ash is lucky to have her. The two spot the plane and Hanna excitedly states that this is the first time in years that she's thought about the future and she'll finally get to use all of the French that she had learned in grade school. Suddenly, Ash -- who is chained to the plane's engine -- shoots Hanna in the neck with a flare gun, killing her. Carol comforts Ash who believes that Hanna was going to kill his friend, and Carol doesn't correct the assumption, simply telling Ash that she knows that he had to do it. Carol helps Ash to get free of the chain so that they can leave, leaving Hanna to reanimate.

In the air, Carol asks Ash if this was his first time killing a living person which he confirms, stating that he's been lucky enough to be left alone until now. 
"I've killed a lot of people. I remember all of them. It never goes away,"
 Carol admits. Ash tells her to get some rest because they've still got a ways to go until they reach France.

Carol wakes up near sunset and Ash tells her that they're about a hundred miles inland. The plane has finally reached France, and he needs to find a place for them to land before they run out of options. Carol spots an abandoned 
race track
 which Ash uses as a landing strip. Looking around in awe, the two find a place to hide the plane in a garage area. Ash wants to find something to cover the plane up so that no one messes with it while they're gone, but Carol thinks that Ash should stay here, something that he objects to. However, Carol doesn't want to risk anything happening to the plane or to Ash. She doesn't want Ash getting hurt because of her as Carol is responsible for him. Ash states that he's responsible for himself, having made the decision to come to France because he wants to help Carol find her daughter. Carol argues that Ash will help her by getting them out of France when the time comes, which she will need both Ash and the plane for. Carol has been doing a lot of things on her own and she has been out in this world more than he has, so she's pretty good at taking care of herself. Ash finally concedes, telling Carol that they'll need fuel which could take awhile, so Carol tells him to work on getting the fuel for their departure back to America. While Carol hopes not to be gone too long, Ash is not to keep waiting if she isn't back in two weeks, but Ash refuses to leave without her. Carol accepts this, and promises to be back, giving Ash Daryl's crossbow for protection and safe keeping.

Carol makes her way to Paris, passing through 
La Défense
 and beneath the 
Grande Arche
, stopping for a moment to look in awe at the once majestic city, the 
Arc de Triomphe
 and the 
Eiffel Tower
 visible in the distance. Making her way through the city, Carol spots posters advertising Genet and the Power of the Living and hides behind an abandoned car as a truck filled with food stops nearby and a Guerrier grabs a homeless 
man
, beats him, and puts him in the truck after asking if he's hungry. Carol grabs an apple for herself and, noticing the Power of the Living symbol on the bags, discreetly cuts one to leave a trail of grain that she can follow.

Carol eventually loses the trail, but follows the sound of a commotion to a building nearby where Parisians are gathering. Carol turns in her gun and watches as all of the desperate, hungry people rush to get the food set out by the Guerriers. 
Sabine
 draws everyone's attention, telling them that it's just a small taste of what 
Maison Mère
 has to offer them which includes hot food, warm beds, water and wine. Simple pleasures everyday and the return of order, but only if they're willing to support Genet. Everyone volunteers and Sabine orders the Guerriers to pick 20 of them. As the Guerriers begin to pick from the crowd, Carol tries to hide in one of the transport trucks, but she's caught and fights back, but is quickly forced to surrender. Sabine is impressed with Carol's guts, and selects her as one of the 20. 
Rèmy
 argues when he is separated from his husband 
Julien
 and placed into separate vehicles.

In the truck, Rèmy accidentally bumps into Carol and apologizes to her. When she responds in English, Rèmy reveals that he's fluent in the language, having been an English teacher a long time ago. The two introduce themselves and Rèmy explains Genet is trying to start over and create new France. Rèmy and Julien were skeptical, but it's hard to argue with bread and wine. At least Julien can rest for awhile and stop moving around all of the time as he has an issue with his lungs that makes it harder and harder for him to breathe and Rèmy had heard that there might be a doctor. However, Rèmy doesn't understand why the Guerriers wouldn't let them ride together. When the convoy arrives at Maison Mère, the other truck suddenly peels off in another direction and a Guerrier restrains the frantic Rèmy.

Carol looks at the 
Mona Lisa
, now hanging in the dining room at 
Maison Mère
. 
Genet
 asks what Carol sees in the painting's expression and Carol tells her 
Mona Lisa
 looks sad with Genet calling her 
"a woman gazed on by millions, never actually seen."
 However, Genet sees a secret in her smile, something withheld. Genet notices that Carol is new, and she explains that she has just arrived, claiming to be from a little east of the city, having come to 
Paris
 as a tourist 13 years ago and gotten stuck. Genet reveals that it's the original painting from the 
Louvre
, and that the French government had protected the art rather than the people when it had all started. Genet smugly tells Carol that she knows that it's the original 
Mona Lisa
 because she's the one who stole it from the Louvre in the first place.

At a nearby table, 
Jean
 complains about the lentil soup that's being served to everybody, purposefully shoving the tray to the ground. As 
Agathe
 goes to get a mop to clean up the mess, Genet intervenes, berating the Guerrier for wasting the food and ordering him to eat it off of the floor. After a moment of hesitation, Jean complies, earning Genet the gratitude of Agathe. Genet formally introduces herself to Carol, welcoming her to Maison Mère and explaining that she has no tolerance for bullies.

The next day, the 
work coordinator
 assigns jobs to all of the volunteers, directing Carol to the kitchens and 
Rèmy
 to the stables. Rèmy translates the instructions for Carol, pleased with his assignment because his husband 
Julien
 grew up on a farm, so maybe he was sent there too. Carol doubts that she's going to find 
Daryl
 in a kitchen, and quips that the only horses that he likes are the steel kind. Rèmy explains that all of the preparations are for an attack on the 
Union of Hope
, although nobody knows for sure where the Union is hiding out.

The two follow the Guerriers as they lead 6 prisoners to where 
Dr. Lafleur
 is set up in an outdoors area. The Guerriers kill the prisoners, and Dr. Lafleur injects them each with 20 milligrams of the 
Amper Serum
, ordering his assistant to time the transition while another group of prisoners is similarly executed. As they watch, Rèmy tells Carol that there have been rumors of experiments being conducted by the 
Power of the Living
 and some say that that's where the 
burners
 came from: a mistake that got loose rather than a natural variant of the 
Wildfire Virus
. Genet is trying to make a stronger breed of zombie and two of the test subjects reanimate as Ampers and rush the Guerriers, but they are quickly put down. Dr. Lafleur orders his assistant to back off the dose of Amper Serum as they need soldiers that they can control. Rèmy worries that Julien and Daryl may suffer the same fate, but Carol promises him that they'll get to Daryl and Julien first. A Guerrier catches Carol and Rèmy and orders them to leave unless they want to become test subjects themselves. Carol heads off to look for Daryl and Julien, instructing her friend to check out the stables and look busy, promising to find him later.

Spotting Agathe carrying a large pot, Carol grabs one of the handles, stating that she was assigned to help the other woman, commenting on how much of an asshole Jean had been the night before. Serving stew to the hungry people in a bunkroom, Carol tries to ask people if they know anything about an American named Dixon. Overhearing Carol, 
Stéphane
, chained to a nearby pipe, says Daryl's full name and weakly reveals that he had Daryl and let him go. As a punishment, Genet had Stéphane's left pinky and ring fingers 
amputated
. Carol asks if Stéphane knows where Daryl is now, but he's reluctant to tell her. Carol doesn't believe in coincidences and there was a reason that she found him and it's a sign. Stéphane is unconvinced, but Carol tells him that Daryl Dixon is her brother and her only surviving family. As Agathe tries to get Carol to leave as mealtime is over, Carol introduces herself and begs Stéphane to help her. Stéphane finally tells Carol that Daryl's at an island fortress on the 
Normandy
 coast and she must hurry because Daryl is a dead man if Genet finds him first.

Carol discusses what she's learned with Rèmy who tells her that it can only be Mont-Saint-Michel which is just a few hours' drive away. Carol asks Rèmy to come with her, but he can't go without Julien. Carol hugs her friend goodbye, and they wish each other luck before she leaves.

Carol knocks out a Guerrier from behind and takes his gun, but none of the vehicles that he was guarding have any keys in them. Spotting some horses nearby, Carol nervously steals one and rides away as the Guerrier begins to regain consciousness. Carol rides towards the exit, but she finds it blocked by a large number of Guerriers led by Sabine, forcing her to surrender.

Sabine leads Carol to Genet's office where Rèmy and Julien are sitting, Rèmy having 
betrayed
 Carol in exchange for the return of his husband. Genet states that information is a commodity and Rèmy apologizes to Carol as this was the only way that he could think of to save Julien, guessing that she would've done the same thing for Daryl. Genet tells the two men that Sabine will take them both back to Paris and drop them wherever they like, and they leave with Sabine.

Left alone with Carol, Genet warns her against trying anything as there are two Guerriers right outside, so Carol might as well sit down. Genet pours Carol some wine and explains to her that they keep a little vineyard behind the mill. Genet wants to know what Carol wants, threatening to assign her to the Atelier -- the place where the experiments are taking place -- instead. Carol asks about the experiments, and Genet explains that they're 
"creating a new subtype of hungry ones, more directable warriors. They will help bring peace back to the world."
 Carol quips that she's heard about the 
"war to end all wars"
 before, and Genet demands to know the truth about how she got here. Carol admits that she had landed two days ago from America after manipulating 
an innocent man
 into letting her fly in his plane under the false pretense of looking for her 
daughter
. On the way, they had to stop in 
Greenland
 where Ash was almost used as a sperm donor and Carol was nearly murdered by 
insane
 environmentalists.

Highly amused by the story, Genet asks why she wants to find Daryl, and Carol claims that she had come to France to kill him. Genet sympathetically guesses that Daryl must've done something terrible to her, noting that they all need a 
raison d'etre
. Carol states that Genet can't imagine what she's done to get this far, and Genet reassures her that she understands. 
"These pains we carry, we women need to let them go. Men seem to have no problem doing that. But we have to forgive ourselves. For all the loses,"
 states Genet, and Carol agrees that they can try, although it clearly isn't that easy. The two women share a drink, and Genet tells Carol that Daryl has aligned himself with a group of religious zealots, surprising Carol as Daryl isn't really the aligning type. Genet thinks that Carol has helped them to find the Union's headquarters and hands Carol 
Azlan
's watch depicting Mont-Saint-Michel. Genet will organize a convoy in the morning for an attack and if Carol wants to kill Daryl herself, then Genet will take her to him. Accepting her offer, Carol returns the watch to Genet.

Genet's convoy stops outside of the Louvre, now in ruins, partially reclaimed by nature, and overrun by a small herd. Looking at the ruined pyramid, Genet tells Carol that she used to work at the Louvre as a janitor. At first, she was on nights, almost alone, sweeping the floors of galleries full of religious paintings and wondered why the greatest artists felt compelled to depict the same violent imagery over and over again. When the undead came, Genet and the others were locked in for a week which was when the paintings began to make sense to her. 
"There was one in particular. 
Le Deluge
. A desperate family hangs in peril over a raging flood. And I realized all these scenes of apocalypse, they want to make sense of the chaos and destruction that humanity brings upon itself. The fantasy that there's a higher power that can make things better. Prayers didn't help us. Not then and not now."
 Genet signals the convoy to start moving again and Carol tells her that everyone needs hope. However, Genet feels that 
religion
 isn't about hope but control and keeping the masses in line. Carol admits that it can sometimes turn into that, and Genet tells her that the Union is deluded by an opiate of hope, and thinks that the masses, the small and unseen, are stupid, that their fairy tales can control the masses. Genet intends to show the Union that they're wrong.

The Power of the Living convoy drives out onto the tide lands near the Nest and stops at a distance that's close, but far enough away to avoid detection. Sabine is concerned that the plan is rushed, but Genet just instructs her to make sure that everyone is ready. Genet tells Carol that they're rallying the troops and to stay close as this is history. Dozens of people gather and Genet tells the selectees that they have been chosen for this mission as they are about to become her most devoted, most ferocious, and most devoted fighting unit. Genet salutes them and offers her deepest gratitude as so many years of research, patience and commitment have brought them to this day. Right here and now they will be making the noblest sacrifice as they crush the Union's tyranny of false hope. In the name of liberty, equality and fraternity they will be remembered as heroes.

Spotting Dr. Lafleur reading the Amper Serum and a dart gun, Carol confronts Genet, realizing that she is going to be turning the selectees into Ampers for the battle, which she confirms, stating that they're doing it for the greater good. 
"We've been training for months. We're ready. The question is, are you? I'm giving you what you asked for. You're gonna kill your friend."
 Two Guerriers grab Carol and place her into the crowd next to Jean as Genet and her forces prepare to begin their attack on the Nest.

Trivia
[
]


Carol has a mild case of 
claustrophobia
 as stated in "
TS-19
".

Carol's claustrophobia is highlighted in "
Squeeze
".


Carol is the last surviving member of the Peletier family after her daughter 
Sophia
's death in "
Pretty Much Dead Already
".


Carol has adopted the most children out of any other character on 
The Walking Dead
 with a total of 3: 
Mika Samuels
, 
Lizzie Samuels
 and 
Henry Sutton
.


Carol's most used weapon is a firearm called the 
Colt Detective Special
.


Originally, Carol was supposed to be killed in "
Killer Within

Sarah Wayne Callies
 (
Lori Grimes
) convinced the producers to decide against it and killed 
T-Dog
 in her place.
[1]
[2]


Carol is one of three original 
Atlanta camp
 members confirmed to be alive within the TV Series out of 33 survivors. The others ones being 
Daryl
 and 
Rick
.


Carol is the last original female Atlanta camp survivor and is the only female character to appear in all seasons.


Carol is the only female Atlanta survivor confirmed to have killed one or more living people.


From "
Tell It to the Frogs
" to "
What Comes After
", Carol wears her hair short, although it is slightly longer as time goes by than it was in her earliest appearances. After the six year time skip, starting in "
Who Are You Now?
", Carol has long hair. During the flashback in "
Bounty
", it can be seen growing out. 
Henry
 later explains in "
Omega
" that Carol had kept her hair short out of lingering trauma from her abusive husband, meaning that her growing it out was a sign that she finally felt safe. In "
Rest in Peace
", after the one year time skip, Carol's hair has returned to the shorter length of the earlier seasons of the show.


Carol has the sixth largest kill count in the TV Universe with at least a total of 130 victims, Daryl has the fifth largest with a total of at least 150 victims, 
Simon
 has the fourth largest with a total of at least 170,

Donald Okafor
 has the largest with a total of over 4,000 victims.

In "
Moulin Rouge
", Carol tells 
Ash Patel
 that she remembers everyone she has ever killed and that it never gets any easier for her.

The Walking Dead
.


Carol is the first adult character in the show to directly kill a child.


Carol is one of three characters in the series to appear in a program outside of

Merle Dixon
 and his brother Daryl.

Melissa McBride

Michael Rooker
 went into a 2013 episode of Conan O'Brien's talk show 
Conan
, as Carol and Merle, in which the pair disrupts O'Brien's live studio audience under the guise of "hiding from walkers". 
Norman Reedus
 went into a 2015 episode of 
Saturday Night Live
 as Daryl, and shot Pete Davidson in the chest with a crossbow bolt during "Weekend update".

Anne
, and Negan Smith.


In "
Who Are You Now?
" Carol kills 
Jed
, 
Regina
 and 7 other 
Saviors
 by setting them on fire. This is a callback to the episode "
The Same Boat
" when she did the same thing to 
Paula
's reinforcements. It may also be a callback to the episode "
Infected
" when she killed 
Karen
 and 
David
 and burnt their corpses.


"
Evolution
" reveals Carol knows ASL, making her one of eight characters to know it, the others being the members of 
Magna's group
, 
Daryl Dixon
, and 
Gabriel Stokes

Beth Greene
, the fifth being 
Judith Grimes
, the sixth being 
Morgan Jones
, the seventh being 
Abraham Ford
, the eighth being 
Rosita Espinosa
, the ninth being 
Ezekiel
, the tenth being 
Alpha
 and the eleventh being 
Gabriel Stokes
.


Unlike her 
comic counterpart
, Carol in the TV Series is to show the audience how the apocalypse can empower someone.


Carol is the second most-appearing character on the TV Series, having appeared in 125 episodes, after Daryl with 148 episodes.


Carol is one of the fourteen TV Series characters whose comic counterparts lack a known last name. The others being 
Amy Harrison
, 
Andrea Harrison
, 
Dale Horvath
, 
Sophia Peletier
, 
Tyreese Williams
, 
Eric Raleigh
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Lucille Smith
, 
Ezekiel Sutton
, 
Yumiko Okumura
, 
Luke Abrams
, 
Maxxine Mercer
, and 
Kayla Brand
.


Carol is one of four main characters to be go from being billed as a co-star to being part of the opening credits, the others being 
Enid
, 
Jerry
, and 
Kelly
.


Carol is one of six characters to survive the 
TV Series
 who died in the 
Comic Series
, the others being 
Rick Grimes
, 
Judith Grimes
, 
Gabriel Stokes
, 
Ezekiel Sutton
, and 
Maxxine Mercer
.


Following Melissa McBride's exit from the previously centered "Daryl and Carol" 
spin-off
, 
Angela Kang
 clarified that Carol's story was in fact "not done", indicating she may reappear at some point in the 
franchise
.
[3]


In February 2022, 
Angela Kang
 restated that Carol will return to the franchise.
[4]


Carol, 
Rick Grimes
, 
Morgan Jones
, and 
Daryl Dixon
 are the only confirmed survivors of the outbreak introduced in 
Season 1
 to not die in the 
TV Series
.

Carol and Daryl are the only characters to appear in all eleven seasons.


Carol has met all the other main characters, except 
Philip Blake
, 
Gareth
 and 
Leah Shaw
.


In "
Deux Amours
", 
Daryl
 lists Carol as one of his friends that he misses in America when 
Laurent
 asks Daryl about his friends. Laurent later names Carol in his prayers since Daryl doesn't pray.


In a flashback in "
Deux Amours
", Carol attempts to tell Daryl that someone had come back, but the transmission breaks up and he is unable to hear who, although it sounds like Carol was saying 
"
Rick
 came back".


As Rick and Michonne returned in "
The Last Time
" of 
The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live
, Carol likely was trying to tell Daryl that Rick had in fact returned.
