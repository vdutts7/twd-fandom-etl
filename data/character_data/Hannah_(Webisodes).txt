Overview
[
]


Hannah is an extremely protective and loving mother who will do whatever it takes to protect her children. Though initially, due to it being in the early stages of the outbreak, she is intially confused and distraught by the walkers. However, when her children are endangered by a zombified 
Judy
, she takes an axe and puts her down with little hesitation. However in the end, Hannah fails to spot a walker in the backseat of a car and gets bitten. Knowing she will die, Hannah stays back and sacrifices herself to the walkers, allowing her children to escape.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Peach, Georgia
[
]


Hannah was previously married to 
Andrew
 and had two children with him but later, the two did not get along very well and she filed for divorce. Her children, 
Billy
 and 
Jamie
, lived with her, however, Andrew was entitled to weekend visits. She knew about Andrew's new spouse 
Judy
 whom she did not think too kindly of due to Judy spending time with her children as well. At the time of the apocalypse, Hannah was driving her car with her children who may have been heading over to Andrew's home for his weekend visit (since they were only a few blocks away from his home at the time of the accident). However, someone jumped in front her car forcing her to swerve and crash, rendering her unconscious.

"
A New Day
"


Hannah awakens from a car crash to find her children missing in a world filled with carnage. As she searches for them, she stumbles across a group of 
walkers
 feeding on a victim. Having disturbed one of them, she is pursued only to be rescued from them by her ex-husband, Andrew. 



"
Family Matters
"


He takes her back to his house, where her children fled to after the crash. Andrew tends to her wounds and explains to her what's been happening while she was unconscious.



"
Step-Mother
"


Hannah will appear in this episode.



"
Everything Dies
"


With the growing risks, Hannah and her family decide that they have to try to get to a safe zone in 
Atlanta
. Andrew goes to their 
neighbor's house
 to scavenge for supplies and the keys to his truck. When Andrew does not return, and risks start to grow, Hannah decides to take her children and run.

While fleeing with her children, Hannah returns to the street where she wrecked her car and searches a nearby vehicle for keys. While searching it, a walker that she did not see beforehand attacks her from the backseat and bites her arm. She kills the walker, but knows that it is too late for herself and that she will soon turn. With an advancing wave of walkers approaching, Hannah tells her children that she loves them and tells her daughter to look after her brother and that they need to run. She stays behind and lets the walkers devour her and rip her body in half, in order to distract them and buy her children time to escape.

After an unknown length of time, Hannah awakens as a walker, and over the course of about two months, Hannah's body enters an extreme state of decay and crawls to a nearby park.

"
Days Gone Bye
"


Her mutilated and undead corpse is discovered in a park by 
Rick Grimes
, who had just fled a hospital after awakening from a coma and was at that point, oblivious to the zombie apocalypse (until informed by 
Morgan Jones
). Frightened by seeing a mangled corpse snapping at him and reaching out towards him, Rick grabs hold of a nearby bike and flees. Hungry, Hannah crawls away in search of food. The next day, a prepared Rick returns for her, looking on in horror and pity at what has happened to her. Just as Hannah notices him, he apologizes for what has happened to her, before shooting her in the head with his 
Colt Python
 revolver to end her misery.

Trivia
[
]


Hannah crawling as a walker has been interpreted by many as a symbolic moment; it is believed she was searching for her children, evidenced by the fact she was crawling to and was eventually found in what appeared to be a park, potentially the same park the evacuation to Atlanta took place in. Also in the way she responds to seeing Rick, especially on the second occasion, she appears to reach out at Rick in a way that may suggest she wanted help and didn't actually snap at him, however, this could be attributed to the fact that she was extremely decayed and starving, making her not seem aggressive compared to other walkers.


Hannah being bitten by a concealed walker is similar to how 
Lee Everett
 from 
The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series
 was bitten.

Coincidentally, both Hannah and Lee's introduction episodes were titled "
A New Day
".


Hannah is one of only two characters from the webisodes to be seen on 
The Walking Dead
.

The other one is 
Callaway
.

Interestingly enough, he is among the walkers that kill her.


They both appeared in the show as walkers.
