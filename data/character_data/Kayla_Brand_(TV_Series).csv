,,"Kayla seems to be a high class individual in the 
Commonwealth
, seeing as her 
mother
 has a tight relationship with Governor 
Pamela Milton
. This is most likely the reason 
Sebastian
 chooses to date her. Kayla does seem to share many similarities with her boyfriend. This includes being quite foolish and unaware, making out with Sebastian while not noticing walkers approach and being defenseless against them. Though she doesn't display the same extreme spoiled attitude as Sebastian does, she goes along with Sebastian blaming 
Eugene
 and 
Stephanie
 for ruining their date rather than thanking them for saving their lives. Sebastian was most likely an unfaithful partner to her, as at one point he is seen complimenting 
Rosita
 on her looks and even going to masquerade ball with a different girl. As stated by her mother, Kayla is one of the only people to be distraught over his death, seemingly blinded from who he truly was.",Nothing is known about Kayla's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point during the outbreak, Kayla joined a 
community
 in Ohio and eventually entered a romantic relationship with 
Sebastian Milton
.
Kayla is first seen with 
Sebastian
 being escorted by 
Mercer
 through the area 
Eugene
's group is clearing 
walkers
. He comments on the 'putrid' smell of the area.
Later, as Eugene and 
Shira
 are moving on to the next area to clear, they notice several walkers approaching a distracted Sebastian and Kayla. After the two defend the couple from the walkers, Sebastian yells at Eugene for 'ruining their date', causing the two to argue. When Shira accidentally splatters Kayla with blood while defending her from another walker, causing her to scream in horror, Sebastian becomes more aggravated with the two, provoking Eugene into punching him in the nose.
Kayla accompanies Sebastian to the Commonwealth Police Department and strike up a conversation with some soldiers. As Daryl and Rosita prepare to head out on their shift, Sebastian mentions that Daryl has seen him handle walkers. Daryl sarcastically claps for Sebastian and gives him a thumbs up before leaving, embarrassing Sebastian and prompting Kayla and the soldiers to giggle.
With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by 
Colonel Vickers
 and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Kayla's fate is left unknown. It is possible she was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.","This list shows the victims Kayla has killed:
