Overview
[
]


In contrast to the other members of his dangerous group, Randall did not appear to be a completely bad person, however he did display antagonistic traits such as attempting to shoot 
Rick
, 
Glenn
, and 
Hershel
 in order to avenge 
Dave
 and 
Tony
's deaths and also encouraging Rick to leave 
Shane
 behind while he was trapped in a bus, although both could be chalked up to his want to survive during high stress situations. Furthermore for the latter, he appears to be quite excited and enthusiastic when he helps save Shane with Rick. 

Randall did however seem to have good relationships with his fellow group members as he showed concern for Dave and Tony and also 
Sean
. Randall however admitted to witnessing the cruelty of his group, though it is unknown if he partook in the same acts of cruelty. He firmly stated he did not participate, though there is a possibility he lied and he did hint a few times that he enjoyed the group he was a part of, and did not seem to be disgusted at his group's actions. Even after being left to die by his group he still seemed to show some admiration for them as implied by comments to Shane and appeared to want to re-join his allies.

Randall is shown to be extremely talkative, which he himself admits he does when he's nervous. This often causes him to say things without thinking getting him into more trouble. After Rick and Shane leave Randall at a station, he attempts to plead with them and mentions that he went to school with 
Maggie
. This causes an argument between Rick and Shane, with Shane saying Randall is too dangerous. It's most likely that if Randall had kept his mouth shut, Rick and Shane would've let him go and the feud between them wouldn't have intensified. Later, while 
Daryl
 interrogates him, he starts to talk about how his group raped teenage girls and forced the father to watch, going into specific details on what went down despite not needing too, prompting Daryl to beat him up more. 

Randall was also shown to be a sly, cunning, untrustworthy, and a liar person as shown by his attempt to convince 
Carl
 to release him from his chains, claiming he was innocent and the members of his group are good people. He was shown to have a strong desire to live as he begs Rick numerous times to not kill him or allow Shane to kill him. He's also not good at hiding his emotions, crying numerous times during his captivity. Although it was never revealed of Randall's true nature, good or bad, Shane took no chances and violently murdered him to ensure he would cause no harm to the group.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Rural 
Georgia
[
]


Not much is known about Randall's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was born in 1990, attended school with 
Maggie Greene
, and was on the varsity baseball team. He also lived with his mother and brother, whom he lost in the outbreak. He talks about having a normal life as "just some guy". He also enjoyed watching football and "screwing around on the internet".



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At some point following the outbreak, Randall's entire family was killed and for a period of time he was all alone. He eventually encountered a group of about 30 survivors known only as "
The Living
" and became a member in which he assisted in scouting missions and protecting the group. Randall himself claimed that he witnessed the atrocities of his group. One incident in particular in which his group gang raped two teenaged girls while they forced their father to watch, but kept them alive. Randall claimed he did not partake in the group's violence though he may have lied. He claimed the only reason he joined the group was to survive.

"
Triggerfinger
"


Randall was first seen by 
Rick Grimes
, 
Hershel Greene
, and 
Glenn Rhee
 standing on a roof across the street from 
The Carriage Bar
, trying to shoot them. 
Nate
, in their truck, told Randall to jump down, but when he attempted to jump, he slid down the nearby roof and into an alley. He screamed for the rest of his group to help him, but they took off, abandoning him. Thinking that he was consumed by walkers, Rick, Glenn, and Hershel ran over to their vehicle and found that he had fallen onto a railing-pike, impaling his leg. They negotiated on whether to save him or not, but they agreed to help. They were unable to get the leg out, so the suggestion was made that they cut off Randall's leg. Randall begged them not to amputate his leg, and Rick used his strength to rip him out of the spiked-fence as he screamed in agony. The three then proceeded to put him in the car and blindfolded him so he couldn't know where the farm is. Randall still unable to walk, Hershel insisted that he should perform surgery on his leg. Shane was visibly angered at Rick and Hershel's decision to operate on Randall, and both Andrea and Shane claimed that once freed he will lead his group back to the farm, causing a war and possible slaughter.



"
18 Miles Out
"


Rick and 
Shane Walsh
 brought Randall bound and gagged with them to collect supplies and to leave him behind. However, Rick and Shane were shocked when Randall revealed that he went to school with 
Maggie Greene
 and knew who Hershel was. He also most likely knew where the farm is. Shane attempts to shoot him, but Rick intervened, causing the pair to fight and leaving Randall lying on the ground tied up. Shane accidentally caused a horde of walkers to be released, which attacked the survivors. Randall was able to cut the ropes with a knife and was about to escape when he is stopped by Rick. Randall told him to leave Shane behind and promised Rick he wasn't going to say anything to his group, but Rick just told him to shut up. Reluctantly, they decided to leave Shane behind as he is trapped inside a school bus. However, at the last minute they changed their minds and drove past the horde in Shane's car, killing many walkers and rescuing Shane. Even though Randall helped save Shane's life, he is once again bound and gagged and thrown in the back of the car. Rick said they will leave him in the barn overnight upon return to the farm, and that he would most likely be killed.



"
Judge, Jury, Executioner
"


Randall was brutally interrogated by 
Daryl Dixon
 to find out where his group was. At first, Randall refused to tell Daryl anything. However, after Daryl stabbed him in the leg with a knife, he revealed that he joined a large group of 30 survivors hoping to ensure his survival. He also alluded to this group carrying out violent raids and gang rapes, prompting a repulsed Daryl to beat him even more furiously. The rest of the group decided that releasing Randall would be dangerous and decided to execute him. They left him in the barn, saying they will kill him at night. Rick's son 
Carl
 finds a way into the barn, and Randall talked to him, asking him to set him free. Carl approached Randall slowly, not talking, but Shane entered the barn and saw Carl there. Shane took Carl out of the barn. Despite 
Dale Horvath
's attempts to convince the group otherwise, Rick decided to take Randall to the other barn to be shot. However, when he was about to shoot Randall, he saw that Carl was watching. Carl encouraged him to shoot Randall, horrifying Rick, who subsequently changed his mind. Daryl takes Randall back to the first barn and ties him up, and then leaves Randall alone in the barn after hearing Dale's screams.



"
Better Angels
"


The decision of what to do with Randall was still left on hold for Rick and the group, mostly due to mourning over Dale. Shane was very persistent with Rick to "handle" the problem with Randall, but Rick was still reluctant. Later on, Rick decided to soon handle it, but with news of Carl's confession, Shane urged him to talk to Carl first. Though Rick reminded him that Shane, himself, told him to deal with Randall, he claimed to do it "later". While everyone was distracted, Shane snuck into the barn and makes several attempts to kill Randall or at least frighten him into submission. Shane then decided to take Randall out into the woods and claimed he wanted to join his "group". However, it was only a distraction as Shane proceeds to murder Randall by snapping his neck, and then slammed his own head into the tree to appear as if he was assaulted by Randall. He then went running back to the farm, claiming Randall attacked him and ran off. Later, it was shown that this was obviously a trap to kill Rick, while the group was distracted, trying to capture Randall. Daryl and Glenn would later run into Randall, reanimated as a zombie. The two had a fight with him but eventually kill him. They examined that there were no bite marks on his body and questioned why he became a walker without getting bit.

Trivia
[
]


In the 
Talking Dead
 following the episode "
Judge, Jury, Executioner
", episode director 
Gregory Nicotero
 confirmed that he had initially shot Daryl and Randall's final confrontation in the barn to where that Daryl was going to kill Randall himself until he heard 
Dale
's desperate screams for help.


Randall is mentioned in "
I Ain't a Judas
" by Carol to Andrea when discussing Shane's death.


A broken neck is fatal if it severs the spinal cord, because it consequently blocks the neural connections between the brain and the rest of the body - heart, lungs, but most relevantly, limbs. Despite the fact that Shane killed Randall by breaking his neck, a zombified Randall was somehow able to get up and attack Daryl and Glenn just like a regular walker would. This was probably a plot oversight.


Randall was initially scripted to kill Hershel Greene in the 
Season 2
 episode "
Better Angels
", but the producers eventually decided against it.


It is revealed in a deleted scene that Randall's last name is 
Culver
, and Maggie discovers Randall went to the same high school as her when she looks through her high school book and finds his picture. Randall's brother also attended that school. However, Maggie was two years ahead of Randall, apparently shared no classes with him, and guesses that she just never noticed him.
