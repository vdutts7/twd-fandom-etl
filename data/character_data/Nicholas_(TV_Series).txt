Overview
[
]


Nicholas is initially a cowardly, selfish, and cunning survivor. Bad blood between him and the 
Rick's group
 is immediately formed when he fights with 
Glenn
, alongside 
Aiden
. On a supply run, after getting trapped in a revolving door Nicholas saves himself, but ends up getting 
Noah
 killed in the process. When being interviewed about Aiden and Noah's deaths, he lies saying it's Glenn's fault, and that 
Rick
's group should be exiled. Nicholas is shown to not be above murder, and attempts to lure Glenn away from Alexandria to kill him. Glenn bests him and Nicholas begs for mercy despite him about to kill Glenn right before.

After Glenn spares his life, Nicholas attempts to redeem himself. He volunteers to help lure away a mega herd along with some others. Nicholas's relationship with Glenn improves, as he admits that he is more experienced than he is. He is shown to feel guilt and remorse for his cowardly behavior that got many people killed. However, he begins to suffer from PTSD which causes him to become paralyzed with fear on multiple occasions. Eventually Nicholas and Glenn get cornered and he loses all hope of survival. In his final moments, Nicholas thanks Glenn for sparing his life, before shooting himself in the head. Glenn then manages to use Nicholas' corpse as protection against the walkers.

Nothing is known about Nicholas' life prior to or as the outbreak began. 



Post-Apocalypse

Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Nicholas joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where, upon being interviewed by 
Deanna
, he was appointed as a supply runner in a team alongside 
Aiden
, 
Will
, and three other residents where they searched for supplies around the town.

During a supply run in an abandoned town, the scouting party was attacked by walkers and killed while Nicholas and Aiden abandoned their companions out of cowardice. In retaliation and to get over their fear, the pair captured one of the walkers and tied it to a tree to remind themselves of the dangers that awaited them during their supply runs.

When 
Aaron
 arrives at the community with 
new recruits
, Nicholas opens the town gates for them and announces that everyone must hand over their weapons if they are staying in Alexandria. The following day after all of the interviews, he and Aiden take 
Glenn
, 
Tara
, and 
Noah
 out to train them as supply runners for future missions. 

Upon discovering that the walker that had killed their friends had managed to free itself, Nicholas begins to whistle extremely loud which eventually causes a confrontation with the newcomers. After Glenn kills the walker and the group returns to the town, he tries to help Aiden while he fights with Glenn but is thrown to the ground by 
Daryl
. Once Deanna intervenes, Nicholas and Aiden are reprimanded and ordered to be more open to the ideas of 
Rick
's group.

Nicholas accompanies Aiden, Glenn, Tara, Noah, and 
Eugene
 on a supply run to a nearby warehouse in search of supplies needed to fix the solar panels. Upon arriving at the site, Nicholas mocks Glenn's idea of scouting all the perimeter to find all their exits if things were to go awry but is forced to follow the idea when Aiden agrees with Glenn. Once inside the warehouse, Nicholas watches as Aiden ignores Glenn's warnings and shoots at an armored walker which has a grenade on its vest, causing an explosion that knocks Tara unconscious.   

After the explosion, Nicholas finds Aiden impaled on a shelf and pronounces him dead before the group hides in a nearby office where they discuss how to escape from the oncoming walkers and save Tara's life. When Aiden wakes up and starts screaming, Noah helps to distract the walkers with flares while Nicholas and Glenn try to release him unsuccessfully. Feeling scared of the walkers approaching, Nicholas whispers to Aiden that they were always cowards and flees to save himself as Aiden is eventually devoured.   

As Nicholas tries to escape from the warehouse, he becomes trapped in a four-compartment glass revolving door, with Glenn and Noah on the opposite compartment of the revolving door, and walkers on one of the other sides. Rather than helping to smash open the glass door so all three can escape safely, Nicholas deliberately pushes Glenn and Noah toward the walkers, thus allowing them to murder Noah. He runs to the van and tries to convince Eugene to leave without the others, offering to run away or stay to die, but Eugene pulls out his gun. Although Nicholas manages to pull Eugene out and get in the driver's seat, Glenn shows up and pulls Nicholas out and beats him furiously until he is knocked out.

After returning to Alexandria, Nicholas is interviewed by Deanna about what happened in the warehouse, where he blatantly lies about the events and blames Glenn for the deaths of Noah and Aiden, suggesting that the newcomers need to be exiled because they are a threat. The next day, he is cleaning blood from the back of the van when Glenn visits him and threatens that he is no longer allowed to go out on supply runs or leave with anyone else for their own protection. 

Refusing to listen to Glenn's warnings, Nicholas heads out into the woods, where he unearths a canister containing the pistol he had secretly stolen from Rick 
previously
.
[1]
 Later that day, he watches in horror as Rick and 
Pete
 are engaged in a bloody brawl and tries to intervein until Rick pulls out a gun. When the fight is over, Nicholas listens on as Rick gives his speech to Deanna and the rest of the townspeople before he is knocked out by 
Michonne
.

"


The next day, Nicholas stalks Glenn around while waiting for the right time to attack him. Having been forbidden from leaving Alexandria, he intentionally makes a noise to let Glenn spot him climbing over the wall. When Glenn is alone in the woods, Nicholas shoots him in the shoulder, which makes him roll down a hill and be able to escape. 

Later that day, Nicholas follows the trail of blood when he is confronted by a lone walker. After killing it, Glenn attacks him from behind and they engage in a brutal fight in which Glenn severely injures Nicholas' ankle while Nicholas sticks his thumb into Glenn's bullet wound. As walkers mount over Glenn, Nicholas takes his gun and runs, leaving him to die.

That night, the injured Nicholas makes his way limping towards Alexandria when he is taken by surprise by Glenn, who fully break Nicholas' ankle and takes his gun. He then starts to beat Nicholas down, to the point of almost breaking his jaw, before grabbing his gun and pointing it against Nicholas' forehead, blaming him for Noah's death. Nicholas pleads for his life and eventually convinces Glenn to let him live. They then proceed to walk towards Alexandria.

"
First Time Again
"


Having been forgiven for his actions, Nicholas is taken by Glenn to the infirmary to be treated by 
Rosita
 when he sees Tara awake from her head injury. When Tara asks if someone could bring Noah to the infirmary, he looks down in sadness and remorse. The next day, Nicholas attends the meeting at Deanna's house regarding how to handle the mega herd at the quarry where he volunteers to be part of the plan even though Glenn disapproves of this. 

In the following days, Nicholas is among the volunteers to help build the wall on one of the roads to deter the mega herd in the operation to lure it away from Alexandria. He works under Glenn's supervision until he fully proves he has changed. When the walkers break free from the quarry and the plan is set into motion, Nicholas goes along with Glenn and 
Heath
 to clear a nearby hardware store to keep walkers from straggling off the road.  

As Glenn and Heath discuss how to approach the plan, Nicholas defends Glenn's decision, stating that he knows what he's doing unlike him and Aiden, which resulted in his former companions' deaths. While Glenn and Heath take care of the walkers, Nicholas is told to stay on the sideline and to radio Rick in case of an emergency. However, he saves Heath from being bitten by a walker. Having cleared the store, the trio runs off into the woods to reunite with the others. 



"
Thank You
"


When a part of the herd ventures away from the road into the woods due to a 
blaring horn
 coming from Alexandria, the group runs through the woods in an attempt to return to the community. As they are attacked by walkers, Nicholas becomes paralyzed with fear for a few seconds. He then helps the injured 
Annie
 get up and supports her and then 
Scott
 as they walk on until they arrive at an abandoned town. While checking any working cars to be used to drive home, Nicholas admits to Heath that he and Aiden didn't know what they were doing during their supply runs. 

Nicholas then leads the group as they search a way to get through the town when they run into walkers feasting on 
Sturgess
' body. He becomes paralyzed by fear again, but Glenn snaps him out of it. The group is confronted by more walkers and retreat into a pet store where Glenn plans to set fire to a nearby building to distract the herd. Nicholas suggests a feed store and offers to come with him, to which Glenn eventually accepts. On the way, they find a walker pinned underneath a car whom Nicholas recognizes as 
Will
, one of his former supply runners companions. Feeling guilty and responsible for having left him to die, he stabs Will through the head before moving on.  

Unfortunately, Nicholas and Glenn reach the feed store only to find that it's already been burned to the ground. Before they could come up with another plan, the herd corners them from several directions, which forces them to run down an alleyway with no way out where they climb up a dumpster as walkers surround them from below. Paralyzed with fear again and losing hope, Nicholas expresses his gratitude to Glenn for having spared his life 
before
 and then shoots himself in the head. His falling corpse knocks Glenn down into the herd and is devoured by walkers. 



"
Heads Up
"


Surrounded by walkers, Nicholas' corpse served as protection for Glenn, who manages to crawl underneath the dumpster and avoid being attacked. After the night passes and the herd eventually disperses, Glenn emerges from underneath the dumpster and looks in sadness at Nicholas' rotten corpse.
