,,,"Ira is shown to be a stoic, brutal, and aggressive individual. He seems to be one of the more prominent 
Reapers
, as he is often seen guarding 
Pope
's office. Just like the rest of the Reapers, he is a ruthless survivor who kills innocent people to get what he wants. When taking part in checking a house that 
Maggie
's group are in, he does so in a very hostile and aggressive manner. He doesn't show much emotion, such as standing guard in Pope's office with a rather blank expression for minutes and also not giving much of a reaction when Pope kills 
Bossie
. After Maggie's group attacks 
Meridian
, Ira ends up being one of the last Reapers standing. After 
Gabriel
 kills 
Jenson
, Ira willingly gives up his weapons so he, 
Leah
, and 
Boone
 can walk away peacefully. However, after a change of heart, Maggie decides to kill the remaining Reapers, including Ira, with his death serving as an example that she is not a woman of her word. His death is also what motivates 
Negan
 to leave, believing Maggie will eventually kill him too.","Prior to the outbreak, Ira was fighting in Afghanistan along with the rest of his squad which included a lot of members that would eventually become the 
Reapers
. Upon returning from war, he struggled to find jobs or deal with trauma, but the relationship between him and his comrades remained strong. He then decided to become a mercenary.","During the beginning of the outbreak, as 
Operation Cobalt
 was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the 
undead
 threat, 
Pope
 and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as ""the chosen ones"". It is unknown if Ira was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers, and either found or crafted his own mask with a pure black, featureless expression on it, and would use this mask as a scare tactic against  those who were ""marked"" by Pope.
At some point, Ira and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by 
Maggie Rhee
 despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group.
Washington and at least a dozen Reapers appear on a dark road adorned on both sides with bodies hanging from posts. Suddenly, the Reapers open fire on 
Maggie
 and her group, killing 
Roy
 and severely injuring 
Cole
. As the Alexandrians flee into the woods, the Reapers chase after them.
Chaos breaks out in the woods as Washington and the Reapers hunt down members of Maggie's group, killing Cole and injuring several others, including 
Duncan
, 
Negan
, 
Daryl
, and 
Gabriel
.
While 
Daryl
 is being taken in for interrogation by 
Carver
 and 
Powell
, Washington can be seen amongst his comrades within 
Meridian
.
After the ambush in the woods, Washington is later present at 
Meridian
, guarding the door to a room when Michael brings Leah to see 
Michael Turner
's corpse. When Leah later tries convincing Pope in his personal quarters that Daryl is a worthwhile recruit for the Reapers, Washington stands by at the ready with his gun. At one point, they start to whisper when Pope mentions he trusts Leah more than the others so Washington can't hear.
Washington is present at Daryl's initiation, waiting outside with all the other Reapers for the inductee to pass the test. As Pope declares Daryl ""forged by fire"", Washington and the rest of the Reapers welcome Daryl with a latin mantra. He is later seen again guarding Pope as he explains to the newest member of the group his past in Afghanistan, his belief in God, and how the group came to be formed.
Washington attends the fireside dinner talking with the others, where Daryl eats his first meal as a Reaper, and subsequently watches in silence as Pope burns 
Bossie
 alive, accusing him of turning his back on his brothers and letting Michael get killed.
After Daryl successfully tortures 
Frost
 for information as another test by Pope, Washington is among the several Reapers who are sent out to check the house their prisoner had said Maggie and the others were hiding in. Paired up in a squad lead by Leah working alongside Daryl, 
Carver
, 
Powell
, and 
Fisher
, Washington is sent with the last two to breach the back entrance of the home, after which he and his squad-mates check every room in the house before declaring it ""clear"". Leah sends Washington, Powell, and Fisher to check the rest of the town, while she, Daryl, and Carver stay behind to give the building a once over.
Washington returns back to Meridian at the end of the episode during nightfall, where Pope reveals he further tortured and subsequently killed a now undead Frost, claiming he ""got everything he needed out of him.""
Washington accompanies 
Ancheta
 on a sortie to locate Maggie's group, but fails to find any tracks. For this, he and Ancheta are admonished by Pope, until Leah comes to their defense. Later that day, Washington is seen keeping guard in a sentry post.
Washington walks through the Meridian school with Leah, and the pair come across 
Austin
's body, having been killed by Daryl. He is later seen with the remaining Reapers meeting with Maggie's group. Daryl offers to trade Carver while letting Leah and the others leaving peacefully. After Gabriel kills their sniper, Leah takes the deal. However, a vengeful Maggie kills both Washington and Boone in cold blood aside from Leah.","Killed By

Maggie Rhee
After deciding against letting the Reapers go due to Elijah reminding her of her promise to get revenge upon all of them, Maggie shoots Washington in the shoulder, knocking him to the ground before then shooting him in the head.","This list shows the victims Ira has killed:
