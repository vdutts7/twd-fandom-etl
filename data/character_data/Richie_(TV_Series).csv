,,,Nothing is known about Richie's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, Richie somehow came into contact with a group named ""the Saviors"" which he subsequently joined. Richie aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered. After returning to the Sanctuary , Negan is surprised to hear a noise and finds a zombified Richie in the courtyard. Negan recognizes the zombified Savior and comments on how Richie is loyal to the end. He leaves Richie to continue banging on the door. Eventually, Richie stops banging on the door. When Negan goes to the courtyard to investigate, he observes that Richie was distracted by some other walkers in the courtyard and started following them. Negan dispatches the walkers with a pipe, but leaves Richie trapped outside. After he decides to return to Alexandria , Negan lets Richie inside and tells him that their situation isn't going to work out, before bashing the zombified Richie's head in with his pipe. Richie's corpse remains inside the Sanctuary when the Kingdom refugees seek shelter from the blizzard. His body is left there after the Kingdommers abandon the Sanctuary to complete their journey to Hilltop.","Killed By Unknown Cause (Alive) It is unknown how Richie was killed, but it can be assumed he died when, or sometime after the Sanctuary fell.
