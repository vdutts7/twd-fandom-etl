Overview
[
]


Although his personality is not well known, Dan appeared to be a brutal, sadistic, and violent person and was shown to be a loyal member of the Claimers. According to his actor, Keith Brooks when pointed in a particular direction, he would viciously destroy anything in his way like an animal. It is more than likely he was a murderer as seen when he helped beat Len to death and surely would have killed Carl had his group not been stopped by Rick, Daryl, and Michonne.

It appeared that Dan was a pedophile, as he showed glee when he attempted to rape Carl during the run in between his group and Rick's. When the tables were turned on him however, he showed himself to be a coward as he started to beg Rick for mercy even though he himself had shown no remorse or mercy towards Carl while attempting to rape and then kill him seconds before.



Pre-Apocalypse

Nothing is known about Dan's life prior to or as the outbreak began.

"
Alone
"
[

Dan is first seen with his group gathering around an exhausted 
Daryl Dixon
, who is sitting down in the middle of a road after, unbeknownst to the Claimers, chasing after a car that kidnapped 
Beth Greene
, with whom Daryl was surviving. After Daryl punches 
Joe
, the leader of the group, and points his ready-to-fire crossbow at him, Dan and the other group members point their guns at Daryl. After Joe talks Daryl into lowering his crossbow, Dan and the other group members lower their guns too.

Dan is first seen sleeping on the ground in the forest, as a 
walker
 approaches their campsite. He wakes up and watches his fellow survivor 
Harley
 kill it. He, along with the rest of the group, walks along the tracks, as a walker roams up to them, he puts his gun in his back. As 
Tony
 pushes the walker to him, 
Billy
 then stabs it in the head with a metal pipe. As they walk along the tracks, Joe tells them to take shelter in the car shed. He aims his gun and clears out the shed. As the group are checking the place out, he claims the mattress that is on the ground. The next morning, he watches as 
Len
 confronts Daryl. He is sitting on his claimed mattress sharpening his knife and watched as Len is deemed a liar. Dan, along with Harley, Billy, and Tony are ordered by Joe to beat up and kill Len. Dan starts kicking and punching Len as he is on the ground. They later shoot an arrow into Len's head, killing him. He leaves the shed and walks along the tracks. He, along with the group, finds the sign leading to Terminus.

When Joe's group makes contact with 
Rick Grimes
' group on the side of the road, Dan finds Rick's son 
Carl
 sleeping in a nearby truck and pulls him out with the intent of raping him. He is shocked when he witnesses Rick biting Joe's neck, ripping out his jugular, killing him. He also witnesses all the other members of his group killed by 
Michonne Hawthorne
 and Daryl. Dan quickly holds Carl hostage, threatening to kill him. Rick vengefully declares Dan is his to kill, and begins to approach him. Dan quickly releases Carl and begs for mercy, but Rick stabs him in the stomach with Joe's knife, forcing the knife up to his chest, disemboweling him. Rick then repeatedly stabs his body in a rage while Carl, Michonne and Daryl watch on in shock.

Trivia
[
]


The actor who portrays Dan, 
Keith Brooks
, described his character in an interview as one who "is like an attack dog. He's vicious. When pointed in a direction, he destroys anything in his path. Some of that is his malicious nature, some of it his sick deviance. But he exists in a world where people don't have to be human anymore. Where people can give in to their worst inclinations."
[1]


In the 
Talking Dead
 "In Memoriam" for the season finale, Dan was listed as 
Deserves-it Dan
.


Dan is the last member of the 
Claimers
 to die.
