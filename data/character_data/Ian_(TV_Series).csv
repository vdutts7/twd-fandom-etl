,,,"Ian is shown to be a ruthless leader. He is very untrusting to others due to his traumatic experience with past groups. He seems slightly unhinged and mentally unstable, as he keeps the skulls of his past enemies on a shelf and believes 
Aaron
's group to be cannibals. He seems to have a dark sense of humor, making many sarcastic quips as Aaron's group tries to recruit his 
community
. Even when being held at 
Toby
's mercy, he doesn't show any fear and merely laughs. Despite his questionable actions, he does seem to care about the safety of his people. Though hostile, he is not unreasonable and was willing to let Aaron's group go until Toby shoots him.",Nothing is known about Ian's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, Ian became the leader of a community called 
Riverbend

Later, Ian and his community would have many encounters with hostile groups, causing him to become increasingly untrusting. At one point, a man named 
Billy Johnson
 arrived at the community and promised ""great wealth and prosperity"". However, this was a lie to get them out in the open to kill them all. Ian killed Billy for this and put him on a shelf with his collection of skulls.

Ian agrees, but Carlson grabs his gun and shoots him and kills his men. Carlson interrogates Ian and demands to know where the guns and cargo are located. Ian says he has no idea what Carlson is talking about. Carlson beats him up. Gabriel punches Carlson, prompting troopers to handcuff him. Carlson shoots Ian dead.","Killed By
