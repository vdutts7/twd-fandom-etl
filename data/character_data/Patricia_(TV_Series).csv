,,,"Patricia is a well-mannered, caring, and helpful woman. Though she isn't combat-proficient, her medical experience makes her an asset to the group. She is greatly distraught by the death of her husband, Otis . At his funeral, she demands Shane tells Otis' final moments to see it had meaning. Shane tells the story that Otis sacrificed himself to save him so Carl could live, leaving Patricia satisfied. Unbeknownst to her, Shane had actually killed Otis so he could escape, something Patricia would never find out.","Little is known about Patricia's life prior to or as the outbreak began. At some point, she and Otis dated and eventually got married. They both presumably lived nearby the Greene family (or possibly in the farmhouse itself with Hershel and his family) and when Otis was hired as their ranch foreman, she assisted him with his duties around the farm, and assisted Hershel Greene as his veterinary assistant. During this time, she befriended the Greene family and became an unofficial family member. As the apocalypse broke out and everyone around their town was dying, the two of them decided to stay at the farm. While there, she continued to perform duties such as caring for the farm animals and helping Hershel with his veterinary work.",,"Killed By Carl Grimes (Indirectly Caused) Zombies A large herd is drawn towards the farm after Carl shoots his gun to put down Shane. As Patricia attempts to escape to the car with Lori, Beth, and Carol, a walker grabs her from behind a car and bites her on the neck. Soon, she is grabbed by other walkers who proceed to devour her. It is unknown if there was enough of her left to reanimate.",This list shows the victims Patricia has killed: Numerous chickens (Caused) Possibly a few zombies,"For a more in-depth look at Patricia's relationships, read here: Patricia (TV Series)/Relationships",,"Patricia is the last character to die in Season 2 . In a deleted scene, Beth blames Lori for Patricia's death, and says that Lori threw her to the walkers to save herself. Lori denies this, claiming she was bitten and she would have dragged Beth down with her if she hadn't pulled her away. In another deleted scene, Patricia can be seen at the gun training listening to Shane and then watching Carl learn how to shoot. Patricia's role in the second season was expanded after McNeill was cast as the character. McNeill revealed in one of her interviews that she received a contract for only 3 episodes as Patricia in the second season, before the character got expanded into a full season character.
