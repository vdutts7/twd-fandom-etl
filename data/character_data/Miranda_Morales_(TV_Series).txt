Overview
[
]


Miranda is a kind, caring, and helpful woman. She is shown to get along with the rest of the 
Atlanta Camp
 survivors. She is a loving wife to 
Morales
 and mother to 
Louis
 and 
Eliza
. She puts her family's safety before all else. After a walker attack, Miranda and her family make the decision to go their own way Birmingham to find the rest of their family. However, this choice would prove to be fatal, as on the way it's revealed that Miranda and her kids were killed, leaving Morales as the sole survivor. Miranda's death would be a huge contributing factor to Morales' loss of sanity and turn into a cruel and ruthless 
Savior
