Overview
[
]


Abraham is a reckless and brave survivor with a short temper and an equally profound wittiness. He was traumatized by the death of his family, which left him a broken man suffering from PTSD and recklessly suicidal tendencies. At the crux of his conflict: finding what it means to truly live. Despite his violent tendencies, Abraham is wise and thoughtful. At his best, he is providing insightful advice and council to his friends, lightening the mood, and pondering the future of mankind. At his worst, he is "grabbing the bull by the nut sack" and plunging himself into peril hoping for the thrill to provide him meaning. He is a living juxtaposition between recklessness and wisdom. In the end, he concludes that truly living is sacrificing for a future. Despite his rough, brash nature, Abraham greatly enjoys having fun, which he can find in killing walkers or admittedly, fighting other people, as noted by 
Tara Chambler
, he smiles while killing the undead. His fun-loving side can also be seen in his evident sense of humor and peculiar choices of profanity, his most prominent personality quirk. He also loves alcohol and does not like to socialize.

In 
Season 4
, during his first appearance, Abraham appears to be a rather hostile survivor. That can be shown after saving the lives of 
Glenn Rhee
 and Tara from walkers, as he tells Glenn that he should give up looking for his wife 
Maggie Rhee
, pointing that she's probably dead by now and that helping him bring 
Eugene Porter
 to 
Washington, D.C.
 to save the whole world is a way more important mission than trying to save his wife. His statement causes a huge fight between the two men, with Abraham almost choking Glenn to death. However, after Eugene breaks down the group's truck, Abraham agrees to travel alongside Glenn and Tara, in their mission to find Maggie and then head to Washington. After they finally find Maggie and her group, Eugene manages to convince Abraham to go to Terminus with the others, as they might be able to obtain supplies and recruit others at 
Terminus
 to come to Washington. In the road, Abraham and Glenn eventually become close allies and friends. 

During 
Season 5
, after 
Rick's group
 escapes from the Terminus, Abraham's original mission continues to be the same; bringing Eugene to Washington, in order to find the cure for the outbreak. His obsession with this mission causes fights with his fellow survivors. At first, he is arguing with 
Rick Grimes
 about the mission he has on his shoulders, with Rick telling him that he's not going anywhere without his missing people and with Abraham responding that he tries to save not only the group's, but everyone's lives. However, on time processing Rick and the group agree to go to Washington with Abraham and he and Rick finally become friends. After Eugene lies to him about knowing the cure, Abraham becomes a broken man and thinks that everything is over, at least for a while. When he and the group arrive to 
Alexandria Safe Zone
, where he becomes head of the construction crew, Abraham tries to return to his normal life, after he realizes that he could actually make a new life there. After a while, Abraham forgives Eugene and tries to become friends with him once again.

By the start of 
Season 6
, while he initially seems to adjust to being in the Alexandria Safe Zone, Abraham's PTSD worsens during the quarry plan, as he begins to show suicidal tendencies, by taking on walkers that are splitting off from the herd. These tendencies also causes him to risk his life, either by falling or by being bitten, by trying to get an RPG that was stuck with a hanging walker, and his frustrations leads to him screaming at the walker. He is greatly intrigued by the prospect of starting a new family, both to carry on humanity and get through his funk. With time passing, Abraham slowly starts to have a love interest about 
Sasha Williams
 and he later decides that he actually wanted to make a relationship with her all this time. Eventually, he breaks up with 
Rosita Espinosa
, as he truly wants to be with Sasha and maybe even make a family with her.

Even in the face of death, even if it is going to be a slow and painful death, Abraham is shown to be absolutely fearless and defiant when 
Negan Smith
 executes him by smashing his head multiple times with his baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, "
Lucille
". In his final moments, Abraham dies a noble and courageous man who makes his final humorous words to his murderer, "Suck... my... nuts."



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Houston, Texas
[
]


Abraham grew up in Houston, Texas, although little is known about his early childhood. At a young age, he enlisted into the U.S Military where he most presumably served in the middle-east, and through his years of service, he eventually gained the rank of Sergeant.
[1]
 At one point Abraham alongside several of his comrades found themselves stranded in the desert (approximately 30 kilometres apart from their base) which had been caused by a camel which had digested their transport keys, to their relief, the animal eventually defecated the keys and their squadron managed to return home.
[2]


Outside of his military career, Abraham grew to become a family man, where he met a woman named 
Ellen
 where the two fell in love and became married, together the pair had two children named 
A.J.
 and 
Becca
. The four lived together as a typical family, located in Houston, Texas where they attended several country fairs as well as a goat rodeo.
[3]
 It is hinted however that due to Abraham's war-time experiences, he gradually molded into an incredibly brutal and malicious man and thus his aggressive demeanor heavily strained the relationship between him and his family a great deal, and thus they secretly became fearful of him. 
[4]




Post-Apocalypse
[
]


After the onset of the outbreak, Abraham was present with his family alongside several of their neighbors in Houston where together they holed themselves up inside a local grocery store. However upon returning from a supply run, Abraham discovered that his once trusted comrades had raped his wife in his absence, causing Abraham to brutally retaliate, (killing four men in the process.) This event was witnessed by his family whom became traumatized by his actions to where eventually they decided to leave him out of fear. 

After reading a note left behind, Abraham desperately searched for his family until he tragically discovered that his family had been devoured by walkers on the road; devastated by the loss of his entire family Abraham swiftly attempted to commit suicide only to be fatefully alerted by 
Eugene Porter
 whom he saved from three pursuing walkers whom Eugene then proposed to him an important mission. Upon being informed (under the unknowingly false pretense) of Eugene's ability to develop a cure - this led Abraham to a regained sense of purpose and thus he personally vowed to help deliver him to their intended destination - Washington D.C. During their journey they encountered fellow survivor 
Althea
, who interviewed them both before parting ways.

Eventually at some point during their travels, the two encountered a group of survivors consisting of 
Rosita Espinosa
, 
Josiah
, 
Stephanie
, 
Warren
, 
Rex
, 
Pam
, 
Roger
, 
Dirk
, and 
Josephine
  whom were fending of against the infected, where Abraham assisted them. Impressed with their skill, Abraham recruited them into their group and agreed to fulfill their mission to deliver Eugene to Washington. Over time Abraham and Rosita developed a romantic relationship with each other, throughout their journey through Houston to Georgia they gradually lost group members one-by-one until Rosita was the sole member left from her original group.

"
Inmates
"


After a weakened 
Glenn Rhee
 collapses from fighting off 
walkers
, 
Tara Chambler
 uses the end of her gun to kill the remaining walker. While she does so, Abraham, 
Rosita
, and 
Eugene
 pull their truck up to her. After Tara sarcastically thanks them for their help and asks if they enjoyed the show, the trio exit their truck. In response to her comment, Abraham tells her that she's "got a damn mouth", then asks about what else she has.



"
Claimed
"


Tara sits at the back of Abraham's military truck, writing the street names on her hand as the truck drives past them. They are forced to stop when they come across a car wreckage blocking the road, and three walkers nearby approach. Tara prepares to shoot them with a rifle, but Abraham orders her to stop and proceeds to attack them with a crowbar. Tara notes that it's the first time she's seen someone smile while killing a walker, to which he replies that he is "the luckiest guy in the world".

The group is soon back on the road, and Glenn finally awakens. He angrily bashes on the back window, demanding that they stop the truck. Abraham ignores him and flips him off until the window begins to actually crack. Abraham then angrily stops the truck, and as Glenn tries to leave, Abraham tells him that he is causing disruptions to "the mission." He goes on to reveal that Eugene knows exactly what caused the beginning of the apocalypse, and that government officials are to meet with him in Washington. Glenn tries to leave anyway, and after Abraham tries to force him to stay, Glenn punches him. Abraham angrily retaliates, and a full fight breaks out.

Rosita and Tara unsuccessfully try to intervene, and Eugene is the only one to notice the herd of walkers closing in. The others are too distracted by the fight to notice Eugene calling for them, and it's only after Eugene begins opening fire that the fight stops. After the herd is cleared out, they discover that Eugene's haphazard shooting damaged the truck's gas tank. As Glenn and Tara once again prepare to leave, Rosita chooses to go along with them, stating that with the truck inoperable, there's nothing else for them to do. Eugene then says to Abraham that it would be practical for them to go along as well, stating that it would be safer going back the way they came than venture into the unknown and that they would search for a new vehicle in the mean time.



"
Us
"


Abraham is seen walking on the train tracks along with Tara, Glenn, Rosita, and Eugene. At night he talks with Tara about Eugene and Rosita, and reveals that he knows Tara is gay, judging by the way she "looked down Rosita's shirt while she served her dinner".

The next day, Abraham and his group follow Glenn after he sees a sign that Maggie left for him.

Later, he asks the group to stop to rest, believing that if they keep going they will be too tired to survive. He also believes that resting for the moment is a better way of keeping Eugene safe. After a walker falls from the tower next to them, Abraham agrees with Glenn to give Eugene the 
riot gear
 in order to keep moving, with Eugene being safe.

Continuing to Terminus, they find a dark tunnel filled with walkers. Abraham is not willing to bring Eugene through the tunnel. As a result, Abraham, Rosita and Eugene head back to find a car. Before leaving, Glenn tells Abraham that he was sorry he hit him. In response, Abraham says that he wasn't and that he liked to fight.

Later on, as the three remaining survivors are traveling in an abandoned car, Eugene spots 
Bob Stookey
, 
Maggie Greene
, and 
Sasha Williams
, and the six of them then save Glenn and Tara in the tunnel after they are surrounded by walkers.

The eight survivors reach Terminus the next day, and are greeted by 
Mary
, who offers them something to eat.

Abraham appears in the train car at Terminus when 
Rick Grimes
, his son 
Carl
, 
Michonne
, and 
Daryl Dixon
 enter, having been captured by the inhabitants after their arrival. Abraham remarks that they won't be there for long, which Rick remarks no and says that the Terminus group is stupid. Abraham asks what the Terminus group is going to find out and Rick responds with the final line of the season: "They're gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out... they're screwing with the wrong people."

"
No Sanctuary
"


Abraham is trapped in Boxcar A and is first seen making a makeshift weapon out of a piece of wood attached to his glove. After the attempt to escape fails he is left trapped in the boxcar. Later on he tells Eugene to stay close to him when they escape. When Rick releases them from the boxcar, he fights his way out of Terminus, jumping the fence last. After accompanying Rick's group after meeting 
Carol Peletier
 and 
Tyreese Williams
, Abraham and Rosita discuss telling Rick about Eugene knowing how to stop the outbreak and their voyage to Washington D.C., but Abraham settles on telling Rick at a later time.



"
Strangers
"


While the group are walking through the woods, Abraham witnesses Michonne bashing a walker's head in with the butt of her gun. "Right there is why we're waiting for our moment," he tells Rosita.

Later, Abraham begins trying to talk Rick into his plan to go to D.C., suggesting they find a road and go north until they find a vehicle. The group then hears cries for help, and they come across 
a man
 in preacher clothing on a rock surrounded by walkers. Abraham assists in killing the walkers. After throwing up, the man introduces himself as Father Gabriel Stokes. He reveals that he has a church and the group follow him to it.

Once the group arrive at the church, Abraham suggests fixing the bus and taking it to D.C. Michonne thinks that they should rest and gather supplies first, to which Rick agrees. Abraham is about to object, until Glenn tells him that one way or another they're following Rick. 

At night, the group are celebrating as Abraham proposes a toast. He says each and every one of the group has earned their title of survivors, but asks if that's all they want to be as he makes his pitch for Washington. "We will make the dead die, and the living will have this world again," he declares. Abraham looks at Judith and asks them to save the world for that little one or for themselves, or for the people out there. Rick and the others agree to join.



"
Four Walls and a Roof
"


Rick meets with the group to discuss what to do next, his choice being to hunt down 
Gareth
's group. Abraham, however, insists they leave, as it is too dangerous for them to keep Eugene in such a hostile zone. Rick and Abraham begin arguing heatedly, and (except for Glenn's intervention) nearly come to blows until Glenn finally gets Abraham to agree to stay for one more half of a day, in exchange for Glenn's guarantee that he, Maggie, and Tara will accompany them to Washington, D.C.

Under the cover of night, Abraham leaves the church with Rick, Michonne, Sasha, Glenn, Maggie, and Tara. As they disappear into the woods, the Hunters appear, arriving at the church from a different route, and break in. Albert and Mike approach a door in the church but are both shot in the head from behind. The Hunters turn around as Rick appears from the shadows and orders them to drop their weapons. Gareth begins to panic and tries to get Rick to back down by threatening the rest of his group, but Rick unceremoniously shoots off his middle and index fingers as he points at the door. Gareth fall to his knees and tells the rest of the Hunters to do as Rick says. All of them except Martin kneel, who insists they haven't been beaten. Abraham steps out of the shadows and puts his rifle to Martin's head, and orders him to get down, which Martin does. Rick talks to Gareth before pulling the machete with the red handle from his belt and slashing Gareth with it. Abraham bludgeons Greg to death with his rifle, while Michonne and Sasha kill Theresa and Martin, respectively.

During the next morning, Abraham gives Rick a map depicting the route they would taking to Washington. The group has decided to split up, with Abraham's group, along with Glenn, Maggie and Tara leaving for Washington, and the rest of the group promising to follow after Daryl and Carol return. Rick then opens the map to find the message, "Sorry for being an asshole earlier. Come to Washington. The new world's gonna need 
RICK GRIMES".




"
Self Help
"


Abraham and his group are driving down the road in the church short bus when it suddenly breaks down mid-travel and crashes. After it catches fire the group is forced to abandon it and take shelter in a nearby library. At night he has sex openly with Rosita, who notices Eugene watching them - as usual - but Abraham doesn't mind, saying "he's harmless". The next day they find a fire truck across the street and Abraham manages to start it up and drive it briefly, but human remains stuck in the air intakes cause it to stall - evidence suggests the truck was used to kill walkers. He is unaware that the truck was also used to barricade a group of walkers inside the fire station, who begin to pour out from the unblocked doorway. Eugene uses the truck's powerful hose to destroy the walkers, impressing Abraham. The group manage to fix the truck and drive it for some time before it breaks down again. As Abraham tries to fix it a horrible stench is blown their way from over the horizon. The group walks out to locate the source and see a vast herd of walkers moaning in the far distance. Abraham demands that they keep going, much to the protest of the others, and in frustration he drags Eugene back to the fire truck. The group begins yelling and fighting, which at this point Eugene decides to confess: he had lied about being a scientist the entire journey in order to survive, and that he had sabotaged the bus to stall the trip, fearing what would happen if everyone found out the truth. Abraham angrily punches Eugene, knocking him unconscious, and is surprised when Rosita steps in his way to stop him, hand on her pistol. He walks off some distance and falls to his knees, crying.

Throughout the episode, there are several flashbacks that portray Abraham's back story during the early days of the outbreak. He is first seen covered in blood and cuts and killing off the last of a group of men with a soup can in the back of a supermarket, then going to see if his family is okay - it is suggested that the men he was killing were attacking them. His family - consisting of his wife 
Ellen
, his son 
A.J.
 and daughter 
Becca
 - is cowering when he finds them, and they shrink back in fear upon seeing him approach, much to his dismay. The next morning, he wakes up to find them missing, and sees a written message left behind that reads "Don't try to find us". He rushes out of the supermarket and searches for them, only to later find their devoured remains lying in a ditch. Saddened and traumatized, he pulls out his handgun and prepares to commit suicide, but stops when he sees Eugene stumbling towards him and calling for help, trying to flee from some walkers. Abraham gets up and kills them easily, then walks back to his dead family. Eugene begs him to come back, saying he has "a very important mission". Abraham pauses and looks back at him.



"
Crossed
"


Abraham spends most of the episode on his knees; unresponsive and staring into the distance. A frustrated Rosita tries to give him water, but he smacks the bottle out of her hand and looms over her menacingly. Maggie draws her pistol on him, threatening him to sit back down. He looks at her sadly, and then complies - back on his knees again. He continues on in this catatonic state, even when the others head off to scavenge and Maggie bitterly scolds him to "get over (him)self." Eventually, Maggie gently offers him her bottle of water, and asks if he really wanted her to shoot him. He finally opens up: "I thought I did... but I didn't." At this point Eugene finally regains consciousness, and as Maggie runs over to help him, Abraham picks up the water bottle.



"
Coda
"


Abraham and his group return to the church where Michonne, Carl, and Father Gabriel have locked intruding walkers inside. Michonne informs them that 
Beth Greene
, Maggie's sister, is alive, much to Maggie's relief. Together they head to Atlanta to assist Rick, Daryl, Tyreese, Sasha, and Noah - all of whom have already gone, in retrieving her. They reappear at the end of the episode, colliding with Rick and the others at the hospital only to see Daryl carrying Beth's corpse.

"


Abraham is present when

"
First Time Again
"


Abraham first appears in a flashback. Abraham carries Reg's corpse to the Alexandria graveyard and is laying it down when he notices Reg's wedding ring on his finger. He draws a bottle of whiskey and pours a little on the tarp covering Reg's body in tribute to him. Later that night, Abraham is drunk on the porch of a house. He plays with Reg's wedding ring by trying to keep it atop his whiskey bottle without it falling. He then notices Sasha walking by him. He throws up a peace sign at Sasha, who, after some hesitation, returns the gesture. Another day, while at the town meeting to discuss what needs to be done about a quarry full of walkers near the community, Abraham decides to go with Sasha to help lead the walkers away from the quarry. Abraham later appears with Rick's group outside the Safe-Zone where he asks Sasha if she still wants to die. He later appears when he helps Rick and the others to help construct a wall. When walkers appear and the Alexandrians are too scared to fight back, Abraham and the others go over and kill the other walkers.

In the present, Abraham is present at the quarry when suddenly one of the trucks on the other side of the quarry blocking in walkers collapses. Rick announces everyone to go in their positions, that they must execute the plan at that moment. Abraham exclaims "We'll do it live" and he and Sasha get in their car and begin to drive off to the orange balloons at the road wall where they will slowly lure the walkers away. In the car, Abraham asks Sasha if she is doing good, to which Sasha replies that she already answered him. As they are leading the walkers away, Abraham notices a few walkers heading off into the woods after some shiny material in the woods, so he gets out of the car, gets their attention, and kills a few of them before getting back into the car. Sasha asks him why would he do something as reckless as he did and he says it was fun. He then begins to describe the events that led to the deaths of Reg and Pete in a gruesome matter, which Sasha notices. Everything is going as planned until they hear a horn begin blaring from Alexandria.



"
Thank You
"


Still leading the herd of walkers away in their vehicles despite many of the walkers heading to Alexandria, Sasha, Abraham, and Daryl all discuss plans to get the herd away from Alexandria without any casualties. Sasha says that the herd could stop them if Daryl goes ahead as he suggested and Abraham agrees with her. As Daryl speeds off anyway, Sasha and Abraham both yell for him not to go ahead.

Later, Sasha and Abraham both listen as Rick alters the plan. He tells Daryl to go back to Sasha and Abraham. At the end of the episode, Sasha and Abraham meet Daryl on the road in their vehicles, continuing to deter the herd away from Alexandria.



"
Always Accountable
"


Abraham first appears in this episode alongside Sasha and Daryl. The trio has successfully lured the walker herd at least 20 miles away from Alexandria. Just before the trio start to make their way back to Alexandria, they are brought under fire from an 
unknown group
 on the road. Abraham and Sasha both nearly get shot when driving away and Daryl gets separated from Abraham and Sasha. They both crash the car into the woods, and Abraham and Sasha both open fire on two survivors in the car that was shooting at them. Abraham draws his knife and heads over to finish the job but Sasha stops him stating that more of the survivors will be looking for them and they need to leave. Sasha and Abraham both make it into a nearby town when Abraham notices a stray zombie. Abraham proceeds to head over to take out the walker but Sasha stops him as they don't want to leave a trail for the group of survivors to follow. Sasha marks a door with "Dixon" before heading in. Inside the house, Abraham notices a picture of a family which reminds him of his own family that he lost in the initial days of the apocalypse. Abraham then notices a zombie behind a glass wall, and he expresses his desire to kill it. Sasha stops him and she proceeds to talk about his killer instinct and his reckless behavior. Abraham jokingly reminds Sasha that she was in a similar position when she lost Bob and Tyreese and that she cut his arm on their journey to paradise. Sasha acknowledges this and states how similar the both of them are. 

Early next morning, Abraham patrols the town their in when he comes across a military humvee. In the back much to his surprise, he finds a box of cigars and a case filled with rockets. Abraham looks around for the rocket launcher when he spots it on a military zombie that is dangling off the bridge. Abraham makes his way over to the zombie and attempts to get the rocket launcher. As Abraham struggles with the zombie and after nearly getting bitten twice, he yells in anger and leaves the zombie. He goes over to the truck and proceeds to smoke one of the cigars when suddenly the zombie falls off the bridge with the rocket launcher barely being held by the strap. Abraham brings the rocket launcher, rockets and cigars back to Sasha, who compliments him for his tremendous find. Abraham then states to Sasha that he likes her and that he wants to get to know her better to which she accepts. Abraham and Sasha both find Daryl with a fuel tanker and both head back to Alexandria when they both hear a voice calling for help on the radio.



"
Start to Finish
"


Abraham is seen in a post-credits scene with Sasha and Daryl. Their truck is stopped by a gang on motorcycles, who demand everything they have, saying it now belongs to 
Negan
.



"No Way Out"


As Abraham, Sasha, and Daryl are driving back to Alexandria in the fuel truck, they are stopped by a group of armed men on motorcycles. The 
leader
 of the gang informs the trio that their guns and truck now belong to a man named 
Negan
 before taking their sidearms. He orders one of the men to take Daryl to the back of the truck and inspect its cargo while Sasha and Abraham stay behind. After some conversation between Abraham, Sasha and the leader of the gang, as the latter is threatening to shoot them, the whole group of bikers explodes. Daryl then comes out from behind the truck holding an RPG, having subdued and killed the biker who went to check cargo with him, and leaves with Abraham and Sasha.

Later Abraham and Sasha suddenly appear. Standing on top of the fuel truck, they’re able to gun down the walkers and save Glenn. Sasha then helps the Alexandrians and Rick fight the mega walker herd, eventually succeeding.



"
Knots Untie
"


Abraham first appears in this episode returning from a patrol with Sasha. Sasha tells him that she and Eugene will switch patrols for a bit. Abraham is slightly saddened by this news but she flashes him a peace sign referencing to the peace sign he gave to her after Pete and Reg died. He promptly returns the sign to her.

The scene then flashes forward to Abraham (in bed with Rosita), who's thinking about Sasha. Abraham tells Rosita that he loves her and she kisses him and tells him to prove it. She gives him a necklace made from a broken tail light (he wears half, she the matching half) and tells him to meet her in the shower.

Abraham is later seen with Carl, Glenn, and Rick who are talking to Jesus in Rick's house. Jesus explains that he is a recruiter for a settlement not too far away from here and that he trades with other communities. He offers to take Rick and a few others to go to the Hilltop Colony to trade for food to which Rick accepts. Abraham goes with Daryl, Glenn, Michonne, Rick and Maggie to the hilltop colony. Inside the RV, Abraham quietly asks Glenn if he was trying to impregnate Maggie, to which he says yes but is confused as to why Abraham would ask that. Abraham quips that he believes in wearing galoshes when it's pouring rain. Abraham is then seen with Rick and the others who are about to enter a building to save a few other members of the Hilltop colony. Inside, Abraham draws his knife, grabs a member of the Hilltop, 
Freddie
, by the throat and nearly stabs him before being stopped by Rick. Inside the RV, Freddie explains to them how he saw his dead wife when Abraham nearly stabs him, to which Abraham looks on remembering his dead wife.

At the Hilltop, Abraham draws his rifle on 
Kal
 and 
Eduardo
 before Jesus calmly tells Rick and the others to trust him and that the hilltop is safe. Abraham enters the Hilltop and takes in the sight and listens to Jesus's talk about the history of the place. Abraham enters the Barrington house who notes how impressive the place is. Abraham and the others meet Gregory who rudely states that Rick and the others should get cleaned up. Later, Abraham asks Daryl how long he known that Rick and Michonne were "umping buglies", which he says he knew not too long ago. Outside Abraham is with everyone when Ethan, Crystal and Andy return from a failed supply meeting with the Saviors. When Ethan stabs Gregory, Abraham immediately tackles Andy who tries to attack Rick. Despite being significantly stronger than Andy, Abraham doesn't fight back and lets Andy choke him. As Andy chokes him, he hears Sasha's voice and right before Andy can kill him, Daryl comes along and snaps Andy's arm. Daryl looks over to Abraham and asks if he is okay to which he grins and replies that he is, seemingly unfazed by near-death. As he gets up, the camera shows Rosita's necklace lying on the ground, the chain broken during the fight. Abraham does not notice it has fallen from him. He is then seen with Rick, Jesus and the others who discuss the threat of 
Negan
 and the Saviors. Rick tells Jesus that Daryl, Abraham and Sasha had a run in with the Saviors a few months back to which Abraham recalls the event, calling it a barbecue. He is later seen loading food into the RV. As Rick and the others are leaving the Hilltop, Daryl passes him a photo of Glenn and Maggie's unborn child, and Abraham looks to Glenn and smiles.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"


Inside their home, Abraham packs his bag and tells 
Rosita
 that he's leaving her. Rosita cries, demanding an explanation. "When I met you, I thought you were the last woman on Earth," Abraham says. "You're not."

The next day, Rick's group caravans down the road. After they sound the horns on their vehicles to attract any nearby walkers, he orders everyone to separate on foot and reconvene in a couple of hours. The group reconvenes on the road, where Rick proposes that they attack a couple of hours before dawn.

Abraham covers for 
Sasha
 as she tries to open a locked door. However, a Savior discovers them and attacks Abraham, but is pulled off him by Sasha before he can do anymore harm to Abraham. Sasha then stabs the Savior in the stomach, but he manages to pull the alarm, alerting the compound to the attack. The group moves through the rest of the compound with their guns, engaging the Saviors, who are now awake. He and Sasha reconvene with the group in the morning.



"
Twice as Far
"


Abraham and Eugene leave the compound and walk down an alley in a local town. Abraham observes that Eugene's mullet has been fashioned into a ponytail. Not only that, but he's been taking on more guard duty shifts, knows how to use weapons, and has even been flirting with women. "I'm a survivor," Eugene says, touting his ability to adapt. Abraham still isn't convinced.

They arrive at an industrial machine shop. He proposes they use the equipment there to manufacture bullets, figuring that ammo is a finite supply and will soon become the "coin of the land." A walker approaches. Eugene attempts to kill it, but the walker's head was drenched in liquid metal, now hardened, and Eugene can't get through. Abraham finally stabs the walker with rebar. An enraged Eugene insists he could have killed it himself and tells Abraham his "services are no longer required." Hurt and angered, Abraham leaves and tells Eugene to find his own way home.

Later, when Eugene is captured and Daryl's group is surrounded by Saviors, he hides behind two oil barrels. Spotting Abraham, Eugene considers his options, and then claims Abraham is hiding behind the barrels, urging Dwight to kill him first. As Dwight drops his guard, Eugene bites Dwight in the crotch. Having moved position into the woods, Abraham opens fire. A shootout ensues and Eugene is hit in the crossfire.

In the infirmary. Abraham and Eugene talk. Abraham apologizes for questioning his survival skills. "You know how to bite a dick, Eugene," Abraham says. "I mean that with utmost of respect."

Abraham, rocked by the day's events, goes to Sasha's house. "You said I had choices," he tells her on the porch. "You have them, too." She invites him inside.



"
East
"


Abraham arrives at the watch post to take over from Sasha. She hands him a cigar and they talk while Rosita watches them. When Glenn and Michonne prepare to go after Daryl, Abraham insists on going with them. Rosita tells him to cover her shift, claiming she knows where Daryl is going.

Abraham opens the gate for Rick when he returns from searching for Carol. He tells him that Morgan is still looking for her and asks where Michonne is. Abraham says that she is still out there and asks Rick if he is worried, to which he says he is. They share their fears over getting close to someone again. ‘I think I’m that much more ready to tear the world a brand new asshole,” Abraham says. Rick smiles and nods.



"
Last Day on Earth
"


Abraham and Sasha both join the group on their search for Carol, and to escort Maggie to the Hilltop for treatment of her sudden affliction, though they come across a small group of Saviors.

Abraham slows the RV to a stop as they run into the Saviors' blockade on the road. Rick's group steps out of the RV. Rick puts his hands up and offers to make a deal. "Give us all your stuff," the leader commands, "We'll probably have to kill one of you" he continues. Rick refuses, retorting that he was going to ask them for their stuff, but without having to kill anymore of them. Rick announces that they will be leaving, but before getting back in the RV, he asks "What if it's your last day on Earth?" "What if it's the last day on Earth for you?", the leader responds before Rick leaves. "Maybe you should be extra nice to those people in that RV. Because you never know."

As Abraham drives the RV, he tells Sasha he is ready to bring new life into the world. She smiles. Rick's group encounters another, larger, gang of Saviors consisting of at least 16 people, blocking the road. Rick sees that they are outnumbered and tells Abraham to turn around. A Savior fires his rifle in the air as they retreat.

The RV encounters yet another roadblock: this time, a line of walkers chained together across the road. The group gets out to investigate. Eugene says that such an elaborate roadblock took a lot of people to accomplish, and Abraham fears for the group's safety. Aaron notices that one of the walkers has two of 
Michonne
's dreadlocks stapled to it, and Sasha notices 
Daryl
's 
crossbow
 bolts embedded through another walker's chest. As Rick makes to kill a walker, Saviors fire at them from the woods on both sides of the road. Rick cuts the chain, letting the walkers loose, and the group quickly dispatch them. They pile into the RV and drive forward.

Back on the move, Rick notes that the Saviors were only firing at their feet. "They want us in this direction," he realizes. Aaron informs Rick that Maggie's fever is worsening. They soon come upon a still larger roadblock of Saviors in the road, this time consisting of about 40 Saviors. Once again, they turn around.

Rick's group encounters a giant wall of logs blocking the road. Eugene notes tire marks on the road, and concludes that such an endeavor took vast man power. As the survivors debate their next move, Eugene points out that the Saviors are probably looking for the RV and might not expect them to travel by foot. After nightfall, Rick and Eugene go over the plan: Eugene will drive the empty RV to lure the Saviors. Eugene hands Rick a recipe for making bullets, in the event that he gets killed. Rick smiles, and says that they're lucky to have Eugene with them. "You're a survivor," Abraham tells Eugene. They hug.

Rick's group carries a very weak Maggie into the woods on a stretcher. Eugene gets in the RV and drives away. Marching through the woods, the survivors suddenly hear whistles coming from every direction. They realize that they are surrounded by the Saviors. They run, but end up back on the road enclosed by over 100 Saviors and their vehicles. Eugene, too, has been captured. The head Savior from earlier takes their weapons and forces them to their knees.

After being captured by 
Negan Smith
 and his group, Abraham is placed in the line up as it is decided who Negan will kill. Unlike the others, he showed no visible signs of fear during the "Eenie", "Meenie", "Miney", "Moe" game with Negan's bat, Lucille. He is then selected by Negan as the victim of the brutal beating, and is killed on the spot.

"
The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
"


In a flashback, it is revealed that Abraham is selected as Negan's victim. Staring Negan down defiantly, Lucille comes barreling down onto him, and cracks his skull. Abraham returns to his defiant stature, and utters his last words, "Suck...my...nuts." Negan laughs, and continues to bludgeon Abraham until his skull is completely caved in. Abraham lies dead on the ground as Glenn is later executed. Later that day Abraham's body is taken away by the survivors for burial. The parts of brain and blood left on the dirt ground from Abraham and Glenn's executions are then devoured by a nearby walker. After the ordeal, Rick envisions a dream where his group, including Abraham and a pregnant Sasha, are seated around a table enjoying an outdoor banquet.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"


After taking the suicide pills given to her by 
Eugene
, 
Sasha
 remembers arguing with Abraham before taking 
Maggie
 to 
the Hilltop
 for treatment, particularly as she had a horrible dream he died shortly before he actually did. Abraham tells her that their deaths must have meaning and that Maggie is carrying the future.

Killed By


Rick Grimes
 
(Indirectly Caused)


While trying to get Maggie to the Hilltop for medical attention, the group is ambushed by the Saviors and they're forced to line up. Their leader, Negan, taunts them and informs them of the 'new world order.' He tells them he will choose one member of the group to kill in retribution for the Saviors that the group, lead by Rick, had killed.



Negan Smith


Negan cruelly chooses Abraham after a final selection, bashing his head with his baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, which he nicknames "Lucille", but not before he discreetly flashes Sasha a peace sign aware of his fate.

Abraham manages to survive the first of Negan's blows and musters his last words, "Suck... my... nuts", before he eventually succumbs to another violent strike on the head. Negan then continues beating Abraham until there is nothing recognizable left of him.

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
John Tyler
.
[6]


Abraham was described as "Early 30s. He is vulgar with rough edges but wise."


John Tyler is the full name of the 10th U.S. President. Abraham is the first name of the 16th U.S. President and Ford is the last name of the 38th U.S. President.


Michael Cudlitz
 stated about his character: 
"Abraham is someone who comes with a lot of emotional baggage. And he’s on a mission."


Abraham has been noted for his unique catchphrases and amusing choices of profanity.

'When you were pouring the Bisquick... Were you trying to make pancakes?'


'Son of a dick.'


'Oh, honey, look at you. You're a damn mess!'


'Maybe I'll let you shave me down all over, dolphin smooth.'


'I don't give a monkey's left nut!'


'We don't give two short and curlies what it looks like.'


'We take a breath, we slow down, shit inevitably goes down.'


'Ain't a damned corner of this damned earth that hasn't been dicked hard beyond all damned recognition!'


'The plan just got dicked.'


'I'm about ready to tear the world a brand-new asshole.'


'How long you think 
Rick
 and 
Michonne
 been uggin' bumplies?'


'Mother Dick.'


'There is a vast ocean of shit, that you people don't known shit about. Rick knows every fine grain of said shit and then some.'


'You know how to bite a dick, Eugene. I mean that with the utmost respect.'


'Make room for my freckled ass!'


'Loose ends make my ass itch.'


'We got a shit storm behind Door A and a storm of shit behind Door B.'


'I will not lie down. I will not abase. I will not give up the ship.'


'You'd have better luck picking up a turd by its clean end.'


'What the bitch?'


'Bitch nuts.'


'Why are Dingleberries brown? Just the way shit is.'


'Nibble on that.'


'I'm fit as a damn fiddle.'


'Just grabbing the bull by the nut sack.'


'We are neck-deep up shit creek with our mouths wide open!'


'Suck... My... Nuts.'


Abraham is one of the few characters in the TV Series to be left-handed.


Abraham's most used weapon was an 
M16A1 Rifle
 which he used until 
the Saviors
 stole it from him.


Abraham has proven to be the physically strongest member of 
Rick's group
 as demonstrated by single-handedly killing four survivors (beating one of them with a soup can), almost beating 
Eugene
 to death whilst fending off against 
Glenn
 and 
Tara
 simultaneously, easily pinning down Glenn, subduing 
Pete
, and swiftly repelling Rick. Also, he managed to survive and remain conscious after the first hit in the head by 
Negan
's baseball bat "
Lucille
", and Abraham didn't display any painful reaction as he stands up straight and mutters to Negan "Suck... my... nuts." before finally dying after being hit by Lucille a second time. Negan even stated that Abraham was "taking it like a champ" after the first blow, showing how tough Abraham was.


Abraham appears to have a fondness for alcohol as shown in "
Them
", where he drinks a whole bottle of whiskey. In "
Forget
", he was easily attracted to beer at the party to the point where by late evening he became drunk.


Abraham has often shown signs of PTSD or at least some major psychological issues, likely due to the loss of his entire family. This can be noted when he nearly commits suicide almost immediately upon discovering their deaths and through his occasional bursts of extreme anger and mental instability (interestingly Abraham has stated that he likes to fight, and sometimes smiles once engaged in combat as noted by Tara).


As of Abraham's death, all of the Ford family is now deceased.


Abraham is the second main character to be killed in a season finale, the first being 
Andrea Harrison
, the third being his girlfriend 
Sasha Williams
, and the fourth being 
Rosita Espinosa
.


Michael Cudlitz speculates that Abraham wasn't randomly chosen but rather Negan intended to kill him because of his lack of fear towards him, and perceived him as a threat.

This speculation is later proven to be correct in "
Wrath
" when Negan admits his "Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe" game wasn't random and that he chose to kill Abraham.


Abraham is the only character to technically die in two different seasons. While not revealed, he is killed in the 
Season 6 finale
. His death is shown in full during the 
Season 7 premiere
.


Abraham is the last character to die in 
Season 6
.


Before being bludgeoned by Negan, Abraham discretely made his "peace sign" to Sasha.

He was not allowed to look at her due to the fact that in the season 6 POV shot, the camera was focused on Negan the whole time.


In the 
Fear the Walking Dead
 episode "
No One's Gone
", one of 
Althea
's tapes labeled "Abe/Doctor" can be seen. On 
Talking Dead
, it was confirmed to be an interview of Abraham and Eugene Porter, revealing that they encountered Althea before meeting 
Rick's group
.


TNA star Matt Morgan auditioned for the role. However he lost out to Michael Cudlitz.


Abraham is the seventh main character to outlive his comic book 
counterpart
, with the first being 
Shane Walsh
, the second being 
Carol Peletier
, the third being 
Tyreese Williams
, the fourth being 
Beth Greene
, the fifth being 
Judith Grimes
, the sixth being 
Morgan Jones
, the eighth being 
Rosita Espinosa
, the ninth being 
Ezekiel Sutton
, the tenth being 
Alpha
, the eleventh being 
Gabriel Stokes
, and the twelfth being 
Rick Grimes
.

Of the characters to do so and still die afterwards, Abraham outlived his counterpart for the shortest span of time, as in the comics, Abraham is killed in Issue #98, and the lineup happens two issues later in Issue #100. In the TV Series, the circumstances of Abraham's comic death happen in the episode "
Twice as Far
", only to 
Denise
, meaning Abraham only outlived his comic counterpart by two episodes.


Abraham may have been the friend to give 
Daniel Salazar
 the cigar for when times are better given Abraham's love of cigars. However, this is unconfirmed.


Abraham is the sixth main character to be killed by another main character, the first being 
Dale Horvath
, the second being 
Shane Walsh
, the third being 
Merle Dixon
, the fourth being 
Hershel Greene
, the fifth being 
Gareth
, the seventh being 
Glenn Rhee
, the eighth being 
Spencer Monroe
, the ninth being 
Simon
, the tenth being 
Gregory
, the eleventh being 
Enid
, the twelfth being 
Tara Chambler
, the thirteenth being 
Alpha
, the fourteenth being 
Leah Shaw
, and the fifteenth being 
Lance Hornsby
.


Abraham is the first named character to be killed by 
Negan Smith
 in the 
TV Series
.


Abraham appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
", "
Variant
", "
Outpost 22
" and "
Faith
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Abraham appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".
