,,"Negan is shown to be a charismatic, cocky, manipulative, brutal, and ferocious man with a sarcastic, inappropriate sense of humor. Negan is a brilliant strategist and a strong, effective leader, having kept hundreds of people alive and is worshipped by many and feared by others. When he was leader of the Saviors, he was shown to have had complete control over his vast group and was questioned by no one, acting as a complete dictator. Negan also acted like a cult leader, as the Saviors all knelt in his presence and when asked who they are, they all responded in unison ""Negan"". Negan appeared to care about the well-being of his group as shown when he personally killed 
Abraham
 as punishment for the slaughter of many of his soldiers at the hands of 
Rick
 and his group. Negan believes that he alone can save the people around him and was willing to do whatever it takes to ensure their survival.
Negan was also an extremely ruthless leader, willing to do whatever it took to obtain resources and supplies for his group by extorting from multiple communities, threatening them with death if they did not obey his demands or did not gather the necessary amount of supplies. Negan is shown to be a cold-blooded killer who kills not just for survival, but to send a message and as punishment for disobedience as seen when he brutally murdered 
Glenn
 after 
Daryl
 attacked him even after he made it very clear he would punish anyone who provoked him. He also has no respect to those he views as being weak as he brutally slaughtered 
Spencer
 after the latter attempted to convince him to kill Rick, claiming he had no guts to do it himself. He explained to Father Gabriel that he wants to help people through their weaknesses and by being strong he makes the world strong. This may explain why he uses fear as an instrument to keep people in line. By being hard on people he makes them stronger and more inclined to survive. Negan tells 
Maggie
 years later that this version of him was just a show that he put on when Negan needed to protect his people and that Negan was only ever a monster when he absolutely had to be.
On the other hand, Negan has great respect for those he views as strong, both physically and emotionally, and those who show bravery and defiance against him. This is shown when he immediately took a liking towards Daryl for standing up to him and punching him in the face, even though Negan punished Daryl by killing his friend Glenn. Negan did the same thing with Rosita in ""
Hearts Still Beating
"", when she tried to shoot him but shot Lucille instead, and although he admired her bravery, he angrily punished her by killing her comrade 
Olivia
. Moreover, despite his very harsh treatment towards Rick and doing everything he can to insult and intimidate Rick, Negan shows great respect for Rick and his leadership skills. He even explains to Spencer that although Rick hates his guts and wants him dead, Rick is swallowing his hate and gathering stuff for Negan so that he does not harm anyone else in Alexandria, and admires and respects that. After Carl tricks Negan so the people of Alexandria can escape, Negan openly admits respect and admiration for Carl's actions despite the fact that it caused Negan to lose the confrontation. When 
Brandon
 tells Negan he heard that Negan was the one who killed Carl, Negan becomes visibly emotional and states that he never harmed Carl and never would've.
He is also shown to be capable of severe torture and will mutilate whoever does not follow his rules, such as 
Dwight
 and 
Mark
 whose faces he burned with a hot clothing iron. Negan has however stated that he hates performing this form of punishment, but also sees it as necessary as his rules matter. Negan will also employ psychological forms of torture as seen when he nearly made Rick chop his own son's arm off to break him completely, being the only antagonist to do so. Negan is also highly prone to psychological warfare and is extremely good at manipulating and breaking most people into submitting to him. Furthermore, Negan has openly admitted that he enjoys killing people, especially men, while he does not enjoy killing women, but he will kill a woman if he feels that he has to. Negan doesn't kill unless he feels that it's necessary. He stated to Gregory that he likes killing people, but under the right circumstances. He was enraged by Simon's suggestion that they kill all of the Hilltop residents, because to him people are a resource.
Despite his brutal nature, Negan is not completely heartless, as seen when he spared 
Carl
, even after he killed two of Negan's men in an attempt to assassinate him, and appeared to feel remorse for taunting him over his eye injury. He has also demonstrated care and love of babies as shown by his reaction to meeting 
Judith
 and cradling her kindly, though these kind moments are few and far between. Also, he is seemingly against killing children under 10. He also has a genuine disgust towards sexual violence and has made a strict ""no rape"" policy within his group, and will have anyone caught breaking this rule killed on the spot, as seen when he killed 
David
, one of his men, for attempting to rape 
Sasha
. He is also generous when it comes to second chances and can be very lenient, such as giving Rosita a chance to tell him who made the bullet, and his treatment of Carl, despite the fact that Carl killed two Saviors. He even allowed Simon a chance to lead the Saviors by engaging into a fight to the death, despite Simon's treacherous behavior. He also shows Eugene kindness by gently telling him that there is no need to be scared anymore. Negan is also, like Rick, a man of his word and does not lie or breaks a promise, and he is always open and true to who he is and never tries to hide it. This stands in complete contrast with other antagonists in the past, such as 
Shane Walsh
, 
The Governor
 and 
Gareth
, who used a combination of lies, manipulation and superficial charm in an attempt to hide their true inner nature.
Despite his jolly, childlike behavior, Negan is highly intelligent and is incredibly good at reading people and exploiting their weaknesses as seen when he almost immediately knew that 
Carl
 was Rick's son and that 
Rosita
 had been in a relationship with Abraham. He was also able to deduce that 
Alpha
 was looking for her daughter 
Lydia
, and used this to lure her into a trap.
Negan lives by a moral code that forbids the killing of innocent people especially children. He shows reluctance to kill 
Carl
, even when Carl has killed Saviors. Negan tells 
Brandon
 in ""
What It Always Is
"" that he has never killed a child and never will. Negan was shown to bond with young 
Milo
, mentoring the boy and planning to take Milo and his mother 
Amelia
 to Hilltop for their own safety, though he asked Milo not to tell anyone that it was Negan who did it. When Brandon murdered Milo, Negan flew into a rage and killed the young man for what he did. When Daryl tells Negan that a bunch of children almost died at Hilltop because of him, Negan is visibly upset to hear it. Negan later tells Daryl that one of the things that pushed him over the edge to kill Alpha was that she was targeting innocent people and children. Negan outright states to Daryl his belief that you never harm a child no matter what. There is however contradiction to Negan's claim of not harming children as in the past he was going to kill Carl as a last attempt to break Rick into submission. This contradiction can be seen as a change from what Negan was willing to do before as to opposed to now.
Negan loved his wife Lucille dearly, despite treating her badly he claims that she got him through life. After her death he named his primary weapon ""
Lucille
"", a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. The bat is a symbolic reminder of Lucille, which helps him cope during the apocalypse. Negan refers to the bat as her as if she is a person and asking it to give him strength. He was incensed when Lucille is shot, losing his usually calm and flamboyant behavior. Negan also shows panic and gets greatly upset if anyone dares damage Lucille. Negan enjoys using Lucille to kill his victims, often using her excessively to install revulsion and terror into others. Negan explained that the bat is the last thing he has left of his wife.
Negan may not have started out with the intention to become who he did when he became the leader of the Saviors. When Carl tried to negotiate with Negan and asked if he wanted to be who he is now, Negan noticeably pauses as if Carl's words struck a nerve or reminded him of who he once intended to be. This, along with Negan's job as high school gym teacher indicates that Negan's time as leader of the Saviors has corrupted his original intentions and turned him into the man he currently is. In ""
Here's Negan
"", it is also shown how Negan can be much less ruthless in the early days of the apocalypse. He was kinder and less willing to resort to extreme methods unless pushed, and even then it took losing his wife to bring out the more ruthless side of him.
During most of his interactions with 
Carl Grimes
, Negan shows kindness and respect towards the boy, only taking on a threatening tone when he uses Carl against Rick. In ""
Sing Me a Song
"", Negan taunts Carl about his missing eye, but sincerely apologizes after realizing that he has gone too far. Following Carl tricking him to save the residents of Alexandria, Negan openly admits respect and admiration for Carl, feeling that Carl is the future. After learning that Carl is dead, Negan is obviously grief-stricken by the news and along with his sincere remorse for Carl's loss, tells Rick that he will carry the loss of Carl too for awhile like everyone else who loved the boy. Negan is further horrified by the idea that he and the Saviors could have caused Carl's death and pushes Rick to find out that he wasn't guilty in Carl's death. Negan's fondness for Carl is clearly displayed in ""
Wrath
"" in which he becomes momentarily distracted by Rick telling him what Carl had hoped the two of them could have eventually achieved, which was peace. However he is seriously injured by Rick as a result and is taken as a prisoner to Alexandria in order to spend the rest of his days as a prisoner as punishment for the atrocities he has committed and to serve as a reminder that people are capable of change.
By the start of 
Season 9
, Negan is now completely powerless and trapped in a degraded form of existence as a prisoner in Alexandria. Despite this however, he is still shown to be strong and has maintained his sanity despite his captivity as well as his menacing attitude. He is even shown to be brave enough to still taunt his jailer, Rick, about his late son Carl even though he is completely at Rick's mercy and can potentially be killed in an instant and appears to have hopes for freedom as he tells Rick that he is not saving the world in the least, but that he is simply getting it ready for him.
Despite this, Negan confides in Michonne that he greatly misses his wife, appreciating the fact that she is not alive to see him in such a state, and admits to her that, since losing the war, he has lost everything. When Negan desperately asks Michonne to see Lucille, he is horrified and broken when she gleefully tells him that his bat is still where he was defeated, causing him to bash his head repeatedly into one of the cell's walls. This illustrates that, while Negan continues to put on a fierce exterior when conversing with Rick, being locked up for nearly two years without an audience, power, and especially Lucille has begun to eat away at him.
This finally culminates in a complete breakdown during a confrontation with Maggie, who came to his cell to finally kill him, purposely trying to goad her into killing him before begging her to do so. Pulling Negan from his cell, Maggie demanded to know why he wants her to kill him. Sobbing, Negan finally admits he wants to be with his wife and can no longer live his life as a prisoner with nothing but his own thoughts to keep him company. Realizing how broken Negan is, Maggie lets him live and demands that he get back in his cell, telling him that imprisonment is the worst fate for someone like him. Walking back into his cell, Negan continues to cry, muttering that his life wasn't meant to turn out like this, showing just how broken he has become over the last year and a half.
Six years after Rick's apparent death, Negan appears to have adopted a friendlier personality, helping Judith with math problems and offering her advice on 
Magna's group
. While interacting with the young girl, Negan's advice appears to be completely genuine and not manipulative and he even gives a fond smile at Judith's take on the situation. He has retained his sense of humor and some of his manipulative personality, which he uses to tease Gabriel. When he sees Gabriel is upset about Rosita, he seems to genuinely sympathize with him, though Gabriel doesn't believe him.
Negan's change of heart and attitude was further proven 
during a blizzard
, when Negan willingly abandoned his group of survivors and risked his own life to chase after Judith, who herself began chasing 
Daryl's dog
 after it ran off, desperately calling out to her, and used his own winter clothes to keep Judith warm. Nonetheless, Negan still retained his rather crude and straight-forward sense of humor, joking about the ""love triangle"" between Gabriel, 
Rosita
 and 
Siddiq
, and poking fun at Gabriel not being the father of Rosita's child, sarcastically referring to him as ""
Father, not the father
"". Instead of rising to the bait however, the Alexandrians tell Negan they know his mannerisms all too well and as a result, no longer fall for such things from him. As a result of his crude humor however, only moments later they mistake Negan sensing a genuine danger as yet another attempt at antagonism before they realize he's not kidding for once. Regardless, Negan seems to have completely changed his ways, showing genuine concern about the well-being of 
The Kingdom
's residents after the storm, asking Michonne about their status. Negan openly admits sympathy for their situation as well, stating that while he doesn't know the people, he knows what they're going through having lost a kingdom.
After killing Alpha, Negan admits to Daryl that he did enjoy working with the Whisperers because it allowed him to do something that mattered again and be needed. After spending seven years behind bars, Negan claims that even his memories have prison bars in them now. However, what pushed Negan over the edge to fulfil his deal with Carol and kill Alpha was when Alpha started killing innocent people and wanted to kill her own daughter Lydia. Negan states that Alpha went too far for him as you never kill someone who doesn't deserve it and you never harm a child. He also tells Carol while making a deal with her that he wishes no harm upon Alexandria and her residents and in fact expressed concern at the idea that his involvement in the plan could put them in danger which Negan genuinely didn't want. Though Negan had the chance to become the new Alpha of the Whisperers and kill Daryl, displaying much of his old personality and clearly enjoying the moment, Negan chose to save Daryl and return to Alexandria despite knowing that he might never be accepted, showing how far he had come from his time as the ruthless leader of the Saviors.
In ""
Here's Negan
"", it is shown that before the apocalypse, and during the early months of the apocalypse, Negan was a much less brutal and much more reserved individual. At first, he refused to even kill a walker, concerned that he would come to enjoy it. This shows that Negan was a much less ruthless individual to begin with, one who hadn't killed anyone living. Though he was less ruthless, he was shown to have the same temper that he would show in the apocalypse, having been put on probation for assaulting a man who insulted his wife. The friendlier personality Negan has taken on after his years of imprisonment is closer to the man he was during the time with Lucille during the early months of the apocalypse.
During his time living in Alexandria following the defeat of the Whisperers, Negan is forced to confront the consequences of his actions as a free man for the first time while working alongside the people that often dislike him at best and hate him at worst. However, Negan makes a genuine effort, forming something of a friendship with Daryl and playing a vital role in defeating 
the Reapers
. During this time, Negan explains to Maggie that his murders of Abraham and Glenn were motivated by the massacre of his men at the 
Satellite Outpost
 and the need to give the friends and family of the men that were killed some justice. In this way, Negan's actions were to a degree like what 
Rick's group
 would've done in his situation and even what Maggie ended up doing to the Reapers. What separates Negan's actions is the sadistic way that he underwent them. However, Negan tells Maggie that, if given the chance to do it all over again, he would've killed everyone in the lineup because it would've saved a lot more of his people. After defeating the Reapers, Negan chooses to leave on his own, knowing that Maggie will never give up on trying to kill him. Negan later states that his decision also came because he knew that he would never truly be accepted and that it was better for everyone if he went, although this had the side effect of hurting Lydia, one of Negan's few friends, when he didn't even bother to say goodbye to her.
When Negan resurfaces again six months later, he has found happiness with his new wife 
Annie
, having finally, truly, moved on from Lucille. Negan also seems to be content with no longer being a leader, simply being a resident of 
Riverbend
 rather than its leader. With Annie's pregnancy, Negan is determined to protect his family at all costs and excited at the idea of being a father. Annie tells Maggie that Negan hasn't hidden his past from her, nor has he forgotten what he did. With how much Negan has changed, he has a better relationship in general with his former enemies while working with the Coalition against 
the Commonwealth
, working side by side with Daryl effortlessly and even calling Daryl his friend to Mercer. Despite the slightly rocky way their previous team up went, Negan gets along well with Carol, even openly expressing his respect of her abilities to 
Sebastian Milton
 and opening up to Carol about his fears about being a father. While Aaron remains wary of Negan at first, Gabriel is delighted to have him back and has no such reservations. Due to Negan saving 
Hershel
's life, Negan and Maggie's relationship begins to improve as well, although Negan is confronted with a stark reminder of his past when Hershel realizes who he is and tries to kill Negan in revenge for murdering his father.
After being sent to the Commonwealth labor camp at an occupied Alexandria, Negan is faced with often being on the opposite end of his treatment to people as the leader of the Saviors with 
the Warden
 sharing many similarities to Negan at his worst with the one major difference being that Negan was never as cold-hearted as the Warden. After Negan tells her that he pretty much was the Warden once upon a time, Annie quips 
""shit, no wonder they hate you.""
 Negan turns to 
Ezekiel
 for help in forming a revolution, knowing that the people need a leader who can inspire by hope, not fear, which is how Negan operates. Negan freely admits that he probably does belong in a place like the prison camp, but he also knows that everyone else doesn't. Ezekiel only reluctantly works with Negan due to his anger and bitterness over 
Benjamin
's murder by the Saviors, causing the two men to clash and Negan to apparently betray Ezekiel. However, Negan instead gives up his own name as the leader of the rebellion and attempts to sacrifice himself as a martyr before being forced to beg after Annie is set to be executed with him. Only Ezekiel leaping to his defense spares Negan from death.
The events at Alexandria, specifically being faced with the perspective of being someone on the other side of a tyrannical and sadistic leader's control, gives Negan a new understanding of how his own actions impacted those that he had once ruled over. Negan and Ezekiel are able to make peace and Negan reveals that his actions were completely selfless and motivated by a desire to leave behind a better legacy for his child than being the monster that he once was and to save everybody else, outright admitting that they are all better than him. Negan also finally understands what he did to Maggie and tearfully and genuinely apologizes to her for murdering Glenn and is even willing to sacrifice himself to kill 
Pamela Milton
, knowing that it is a likely suicide mission and wanting to spare Maggie that. After spending so long working with Negan and having him apologize to her, Maggie recognizes that Negan is both genuine and trying to change, but she can't forgive him for what he did in the end. Negan becomes visibly emotional as Maggie talks to him and describes the man that he has so brutally murdered, silently listening as Maggie tells Negan what he took from the world and how sadistically he did it. However, Maggie decides to try to stop hating Negan and move on, even offering him a place at the Hilltop.
The loss of his family and Negan's separation from the good influences of his friends in the 
Coalition
 have caused him to regress into some of his more extreme behaviors in the years since 
Pamela Milton
's defeat. For example, Negan is more confrontational and willing to commit brutal 
murders
 in order to protect the people under his protection like he did as the leader of 
the Saviors
. However, Negan has no interest in going back to being the monster that he had to be as the leader of the Saviors and continues to look back on many of his actions with regret for those that he has harmed and begins to recognize that Maggie may be right that he's a monster while Maggie herself begins to see Negan and his actions in a new light.
Negan is shown to have a deep bond with his young companion 
Ginny
, seeking a safe new home for her. Despite Ginny's muteness and Negan's initial frustration at his inability to communicate with her as well as he would like, Negan quickly developed an understanding of what Ginny is trying to tell him based off of non-verbal clues. Negan cares very deeply about Ginny and her about Negan in return to the point of following him to 
Manhattan
 after realizing that he's potentially in danger from 
Maggie
. Negan later admits that he's the one who had 
murdered
 
Ginny's father
, thus indirectly causing the young girl to be so traumatized in the first place, and that he had tracked her down out of guilt. In order to protect the young girl, Negan harshly tells her that Ginny is only a price that he had to pay and that he never truly cared for her, something that is quite clearly not true and which Maggie sympathetically notes must've been very hard for him to do.
Negan continues to carry a great deal of affection for 
Hershel Rhee
, risking his life to help Maggie on a rescue mission for the boy despite Hershel's hatred of him. During their brief reunion, Negan warmly greets Hershel who is mainly angry about his mother's continuing obsession with Negan and doesn't respond. 
The Dama
, after having heard the story of 
Glenn
's murder from Hershel, later notes that she could sense that Negan feels remorseful and responsible for the boy whose family he had destroyed, something that Hershel himself couldn't sense. As a result, the Dama is able to threaten Negan into compliance by using Hershel as leverage against him, even after Hershel has been released.","Negan Smith grew up in Virginia. As a child, he brought stray dogs into their house which his mother disapproved of. One day he brought home a vicious dog that killed all the others he adopted and bit off half of his mother's ear when she intervened.
[1]
 In high school, Negan grew into a bully who enjoyed humiliating others, upon where he gained a strong penchant for profanity and enjoyment for power games.
[2]
Years later, Negan worked as a high school gym teacher, helping his students improve upon their weaknesses and molding them into stronger individuals. He later met a woman named 
Lucille
 whom he described as an 'angel', where the pair fell in love and married. Among their similar interests were being fans of the country musician 
Half Moon
, heavy metal band Iron Maiden, and singer Joe Cocker. Although they desired to have a child together they never managed to start a family.
[3]
Negan and Lucille frequented at a local bar, which contained a jukebox of their song, ""You Are So Beautiful"" by Joe Cocker. While playing one night, a drunken patron became loud and distracting, ruining their song. Lucille asked the man to keep it down and asked for fifty cents to play it again. The man was rude to Lucille, causing Negan to go berserk and beat him nearly to death. He then took $1 from the man's wallet and played their song twice until the police arrested him. The man, however, was a parent to a couple of students attending Negan's high school - and was thus fired from his position. Negan was charged with misdemeanor assault and sentenced to probation and was sued by the man. Lucille had to pay for the man's medical bills. Despite this ordeal, Lucille defended Negan's actions.
Over time however, Negan gradually became depressed with losing his job he loved. He then began an affair with Lucille's best friend, 
Janine
. Refusing to go back to college and find another career, Negan went spree spending on luxuries they couldn't afford. Often times, he would play 
Gears of War 2
 in his basement with young kids online while being verbally obscene. His later expense was a $600 leather jacket, causing a fight between him and Lucille. Unable to return it because Negan threw the receipt away, Lucille hid it in the crawl space. At dinner, Lucille asked Negan to take her to the doctor for an MRI tomorrow, but lied and said he was meeting with the probation officer, when in reality he was meeting with Janine. That night, he came home to Lucille who revealed she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Unknown to him, she was also aware of the affair with Janine. Negan immediately broke it off with Janine and devoted his time to Lucille. The doctors revealed a chemotherapy treatment for Lucille that would hopefully clear her through the cancer. At the time of Lucille's diagnosis, the outbreak was just beginning.","In the fall of 2010, the Wildfire Outbreak went global. Negan and Lucille took shelter in their basement with an external generator. Using the calendar the doctor gave them, Negan began to scavenge for chemo and taught himself how to administer it in Lucille. A caravan of marauding doctors occasionally came through to supply Negan with the chemo. Seven months into the outbreak, the generator attracted a Walker. He turned the generator off in order to make the Walker lose interest, forgoing him and Lucille watching a James Bond movie while she received her chemo. Negan attempted to read 
Pride and Prejudice
 to Lucille instead, but disliked the book - prompting Negan to deal with the Walker. With Negan unable to kill it, Lucille shot it with their last bullet. With only a few chemo treatments left, Negan went scavenging to complete her treatment. He found a stash of marijuana to help with her nausea. Lucille feared that living in isolation was too dangerous and that they needed to move and find people. Negan argued that the outside was too dangerous for them to travel in her condition, and that when her treatment was over they could go out. With the generator off, Negan cuddled Lucille at night to keep her warm while singing their song, ""You Are So Beautiful.""
The next day, they tried on Lucille's wigs and played darts while she received her chemo. That night, the generator attracted another Walker. Lucille, preparing dinner, assured Negan that it's okay to kill them, but Negan feared that he would get used to it and instead turned off the generator. After eating cooked dog food for dinner, Lucille surprised Negan with the leather jacket they fought about before the apocalypse as an impromptu anniversary gift and apologized for fighting about it. Negan insisted that he was a bad husband, but Lucille assured him that she always saw the best of him and stuck around for that reason. They then smoked the pot and had sex that night. However, Negan forgot to turn the generator back on before falling asleep, causing the chemo to get ruined. While trying to figure out where to find more chemo, Lucille revealed to him that she knew about the affair with Janine, and that she forgives him because he made up for it in the past seven months. With Lucille accepting of her death, she asked Negan to just stay home with her until the end. Negan refused and set out to find more supplies.
For six weeks, Negan searched for marauding doctors for supplies. During this time, he broke his hammer using it against a Walker. He then used his empty gun for show. Low on energy, he finally found the marauding doctors, 
Franklin
 and his daughter, 
Laura
 and attempted to rob them. Laura, however, knocked him out with a 
wooden baseball bat
. Franklin handcuffed him in the medical trailer and treated his fatigue, while Laura went to their warehouse to find the supplies on Negan's list. Franklin and Laura then supplied Negan with the chemo and sent him on his way, with Laura giving him her wooden baseball bat. Three days later, however, on his way back, he was captured by a gang calling themselves 
Valak's Vipers
 and taken to a roadhouse. Their leader, 
Craven
, then tortured Negan looking for information on the source of the chemo. He tried to distract Craven with his life story while he unscrewed the screw on the chair he was tied to. Craven, however, got impatient and threatened to kill him, and by extension Lucille. Negan begrudgingly revealed the doctors' location. After acquiring Franklin, Laura, and their medical trailer - Negan was released with his chemo.
Negan returned home, but discovered that Lucille had killed herself by overdosing on pills and putting a plastic bag over her head in order to set Negan free from his responsibilities. Grief-stricken, Negan was unable to put her down. Negan went outside and took the barbed-wire from his fence and wrapped it around the wooden baseball bat Laura gave him. He then doused Lucille and the house in gasoline and set the place on fire. Negan then returned to the roadhouse where the Vipers were and killed them all. Franklin was able to escape using the screw Negan loosened from the chair earlier and subdued Craven. Negan then told Craven about how his temper and violence caused him trouble before the world ended, but was now the only reason why he was alive - and proceeded to kill Craven with the baseball bat. He then rescued Franklin and Laura and named his baseball bat ""Lucille"" in honor of his late wife. At some point later, Negan formed a group of survivors he named ""the Saviors"", inspired by the mascot of the school he once worked at. The central headquarters for the group became a factory called the Sanctuary, after Negan took the place from its apparently incapable leader.
After Negan took charge over the factory, some survivors who lived in the factory long before him, they revealed to him that one notable resident of the factory, 
Simon
, who helped Negan take the Sanctuary, encountered and subjugated another large group, under an extortion racket that was similarly later imposed on the Hilltop and Kingdom. However, the 
Oceanside
 group rebelled against him but lost the subsequent skirmish. Under Simon's orders, he along with other survivors of his group lined up and killed every surviving male over 10 years old, then ordered the group to continue their service. Ultimately, the group, now consisting entirely of women and children, ended their deal with him by leaving their original settlement on foot. After Negan heard about Simon's role on that event, he kept an eye on Simon with extreme caution due to his brutal nature, disobedience of certain orders and possibility of being a threat in the future because of what he is capable of. Despite Negan knowing about Simon's bloodthirsty nature and being a possible threat for him, he still appointed him as his right-hand man.
Over time, however, Negan gradually descended into a vicious, totalitarian leader who asserted his position of authority through forceful dominance and intimidation with which he fiercely ruled over his community which mainly consisted of thugs and bandits who operated under his command.
[4]
 Throughout the following months, Negan and his group grew in size (consisting of well over 600 survivors), and he appointed several lieutenants, including 
Wade
, 
Paula
, 
Jiro
, 
Gavin
, 
Arat
, 
Regina
 and eventually 
Dwight
. He also established several outposts located throughout the Washington, D.C. area. These outposts operated semi-autonomously, lead by a lieutenant, and manned by a sizable number of Saviors. They were responsible for finding and terrorizing other survivors and communities, subjugating them to Negan's will. Typically, one outpost was assigned to at least one community under Savior rule.
At some point, Negan and his group discovered a community known as the 
Hilltop Colony
. Upon meeting the community leader, 
Gregory
, Negan dispatched a group of Saviors to demand half of the community's resources on a weekly basis. In exchange, they promised not to destroy the community and offered to clear the local area of the undead. Though the Hilltop was reluctant to comply, the Saviors showed their true motives by demonstrating their power, killing 
Rory
, a young man, as a display of superiority.
[5]
 Negan later became aware of the existence of another community named '
The Kingdom
'. A group of Saviors met with the community leader 
Ezekiel
 and demanded a portion of supplies in exchange for leaving the community unscathed. The Kingdom complied, and the Saviors recognized Ezekiel's capabilities. A truce was quickly settled between the two groups and thus they conducted weekly trades that were kept hidden from the wider community's knowledge.
[6]
 Despite his harsh and sometimes violent methods, Negan was incredibly successful at keeping his group safe and kept more than six-hundred people alive.
Following their departure from the 
Coalition
, Negan and 
Annie
 eventually move to a cabin outside of 
New Babylon
 in New York where they raise their son, 
Joshua
. However, after a few years, Annie is robbed and beaten by five men while on a trading run into New Babylon. Despite Annie begging him not to do anything stupid, Negan tracks down the five men, one of whom is a 
New Babylon Federation
 magistrate, and kills them in 
revenge
, although Negan later admits that he's not sure that he actually intended to kill them when Negan had confronted them. As a result, Negan is hunted by the Federation's marshals for 
murder
, forcing Negan and his family on the run which proves to be very hard on Annie. In order to protect his wife and son, Negan puts them on a wagon train to Missouri, claiming that he will be right behind them. Instead, Negan stays behind, although he thinks about Annie and Joshua every day and hopes that they're alright.
Left alone, Negan remains on the run from the New Babylon marshals over the next few years, working a series of odd jobs to make a living. Negan eventually learns that 
one
 of his victims has a young daughter named 
Ginny
 who was left alone in the world with the murder of her father. Guilt-stricken, Negan tracks Ginny down to a farm where she's living and works there for awhile as a farm hand, learning that Ginny was rendered mute by the traumatic death of her father. When the marshals eventually catch up to Negan, Ginny insists upon accompanying him, and Negan allows her to join him, searching for a safe new home for his young companion. Negan never reveals his true crime to Ginny, instead lying that he's wanted for robbing a wagon train.","This list shows the victims Negan has killed:

.","Negan is the fourth major recurring primary 
antagonist
 in the 
TV Series
, the first being 
Shane Walsh
, the second being 
Philip Blake
, the third being 
Gareth
, the fifth being 
Alpha
, the sixth being 
Lance Hornsby
, and the seventh being 
Pamela Milton
.

Negan has the most appearances in the TV Series, appearing in more than 50 episodes alive (including the dream sequence in ""
Honor
"" and the hallucination sequence in ""
What We Become
""), out of the other major recurring primary antagonists.


Negan is the first major recurring primary antagonist to appear in more than five and a half seasons, making him the longest major recurring primary antagonist on 
The Walking Dead
.


Negan holds the longest lifespan of any antagonist in the series, lasting more than 75 episodes.


Negan is the first major recurring primary antagonist to interact with another major recurring primary antagonist; Dee.


Negan is the only major recurring primary antagonist to kill another major recurring primary antagonist; Dee.


Negan is the only major recurring primary antagonist to renounce his antagonistic ways.


Negan is one of four antagonists to survive the TV Series, the others being 
Eugene Porter
, 
Pamela Milton
, and 
Vickers
.


The casting call for this character used the name 
Orin
.

Negan was described as ""30s to Mid 40s. A physically imposing, charismatic, brutal, smart, ferocious, frightening, hilarious, inappropriate, oddly friendly, fun loving sociopath that is both a leader of men and a killer of men. He has both a practical and emotional intelligence, he's a brilliant strategist, he's pure, dangerous, murderous, often gleeful, that still has both discipline and a code. And he has a temper that can vaporize people. He's truly one of the strongest personalities ever.""


The name is likely a reference to the character, Orin, from Little Shop of Horrors, who is also a sociopathic sadist who wears a leather jacket.


Henry Rollins
, who partially inspired the character's design, auditioned for the role. However it was ultimately handed down to 
Jeffrey Dean Morgan
 instead.
[7]


Matthew Lillard revealed that he auditioned for the role and was one of the final candidates, before Morgan was cast. Other actors who auditioned include 
Ritchie Coster
, 
Garret Dillahunt
, Timothy Olyphant, Jon Hamm and Matt Dillon.


Negan was originally called Nagus by 
Robert Kirkman
: ""Every now and then I just make up a word and then I look it up and it's a name. So he was Nagus for a long time, and then I realized that the Ferengi high commander on 
Deep Space Nine
 was called the Grand Nagus. And I was like, 'Oh, that's where I got that! Oh, okay. Uhh, maybe he's Negan.' So that's how that happened"".


Just like his comic counterpart, Negan's signature weapon is a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire he calls ""
Lucille
"".

Negan very rarely uses a gun, preferring his baseball bat.


Upon describing the character, Kirkman stated that ""Negan is kind of an atomic bomb that's going to be dropped onto the show and the show will probably never be the same after that"".


Negan's outfit was designed by costume designer 
Eulyn Hufkie
, who custom made his jacket, belt and hand wraps in order to specifically match his 
comic book counterpart
.
[8]


Upon discussing Negan's foul-mouthed nature, Jeffery Dean Morgan stated: ""We're going to push 
AMC
, the plan is to push them as far as they can because it's who Negan is. He uses some colorful language. And I use some colorful language. And reading the 
comic
, it's important. So we'll see where that lands. It's our intention that this character is going to leap off the pages of the comic book. It's very important because, that's who he is. Some of the characters there's much more leeway, but Negan is a guy that you want to keep as true as possible, and that would be how I want to play him as well.""

Negan's first appearance in ""
Last Day on Earth
"" featured no use of the word ""fuck"" and Negan's general language was kept tame. However, in the DVD and Blu-Ray release of 
Season 6
, his debut was partially a re-shot, featuring speech almost identical to his comic counterpart.


According to Kirkman, he expressed that Negan and 
Rick
 share several similarities as the pair have even been described as 'two sides of the same coin, only Negan's moral compass is a little more out of whack'.
[9]


Negan has the second largest kill count out of any character on 
The Walking Dead
, with a total of at least 230 victims. Rick has the largest with a total of at least 3,070 victims.

Negan possesses the highest kill count of any antagonist encountered on 
The Walking Dead
.


In an interview with Jeffrey Dean Morgan, upon being questioned regarding any insight into Negan's backstory, he elaborated that Kirkman is creating a prequel story solely dedicated to the character titled 
Here's Negan
. Morgan expressed hope of divulging into this, however nothing is confirmed as of yet. 
Scott Gimple
 has stated he has an idea to show Negan's backstory however it's unknown when it will be shown.

In November 2020, it was confirmed that an episode of 
Season 10
 would be titles ""
Here's Negan
"", thus confirming the adaption.


Negan despises sexual violence. This is shown when he kills 
David
 for attempting to rape 
Sasha
.

Despite his claims, Negan himself is arguably a rapist by sexual coercion. While the women in his harem may verbally consent to sex, it is made clear that none of them are even comfortable being in the same room as him, much less having sex with him, which they only do to keep their family members safe and to have access to the medicine they need to live, such as the case with Tina, who's a diabetic. Negan also intimidates Amber into staying with him after she had sex with Mark by telling her that if she wanted to leave him, she could, but he would force her and her family to return to the harsh working condition beneath them.

Due to this fact. Negan and his ""wives"" are widely considered the most controversial aspect of both the TV series and comics, since Negan is later redeemed, but is never held accountable for his treatment of them.


Negan exhibits several symptoms of what is known as a God complex, living a life of total and uninhibited dominion over any form of life he sees, people who will follow his every command.


Negan is the only character introduced in Season 6 confirmed to be alive.


Negan is one of only four named former Saviors confirmed to be alive, the others being 
Eugene Porter
, 
Gracie
 and 
The Croat
.


Negan's imprisonment by Rick bares many similarities to the 
Crazed Man
, the leader of a group of bandits and rapists who took over 
Terminus
 and tortured the residents there though he, like Negan, was eventually defeated and imprisoned as punishment for the atrocities he committed.

Ironically, the Crazed Man was even mistaken by many fans to actually be Negan during his brief appearance in ""
No Sanctuary
"".


Negan has officially killed more main characters than any other antagonist both directly and caused. He is responsible for the deaths of 5 main characters: 
Abraham Ford
, 
Glenn Rhee
, 
Spencer Monroe
, 
Simon
, and 
Alpha
.

Negan is also the first main antagonist to kill more than one main character in one episode (Abraham Ford and Glenn Rhee), with the second being Dee.


Negan was revealed as a playable guest character in the video game 
Tekken 7
, produced by Namco, during EVO 2018. He is part of the season two pass of DLC content for the game.
[10]


Negan also has his own stage in the game, titled ""Last Day on Earth"" based off the first appearance of Negan in the TV show.


Negan's reveal trailer mirrors a scene where Negan bangs at the Alexandria Safe Zone's gates in the Season 7 episode ""
Service
"" and demands to be let in. It also features one of his quotes from his debut scene in Season 6's ""
Last Day on Earth
"".

His gameplay trailer
[11]
 mirrors his debut scene where he executed both Abraham and Glenn, with some creative liberties taken. For example...

In the beginning, Negan is called out of the RV by 
Bryan Fury
. As Negan walks across the captives, 
Lars Alexandersson
 rises up and punches Negan. This serves to showcase Negan's in-game fighting style as he fights Lars, followed by 
Master Raven
, 
Heihachi Mishima
, 
Kazumi Mishima
, 
Jin Kazama
, 
Nina Williams
, 
Steve Fox
, and then 
Kazuya Mishima
. He then begins his eenie meenie miney mo before using his 
Rage Art
 on 
Paul Phoenix
.


Negan is also a playable character in other media such as 
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Mobile
, 
Magic: The Gathering
, and 
Brawlhalla
