Trivia






Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Afghanistan
[
]


Prior to the outbreak, Montanio was fighting in Afghanistan along with the rest of his squad which included a lot of members that would eventually become the 
Reapers
. Upon returning from war, he struggled to find jobs or deal with trauma, but the relationship between him and his comrades remained strong. He then decided to become a mercenary.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the beginning of the outbreak, as 
Operation Cobalt
 was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the 
undead
 threat, 
Pope
 and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as "the chosen ones". It is unknown if Montanio was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers.



Tennessee
[
]


At some point, Montanio and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by 
Maggie Rhee
 despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group.



Season 11
[
]


During the hunt for 
Maggie Rhee
 and her team, Montanio locates the 
church
 where a severely wounded 
Alden
 is hiding out. Following a fight, Montanio kills Alden by slitting his throat, but Alden manages to kill the Reaper at the same time. Both men subsequently reanimate.



"
Rendition
"
[
]


While trying to get 
Pope
 to recruit 
Daryl
 into 
the Reapers
, 
Leah
 mentions that Montanio and 
Nicholls
 are still missing since their attack on the Alexandrians and Wardens a couple days prior.



"
No Other Way
"
[
]


After defeating 
the Reapers
, 
Maggie
 returns to the 
church
 in search of 
Alden
. Upon Maggie entering the church, the zombified Montanio attacks her, but Maggie quickly stabs him in the head and puts him down. To her sorrow, Maggie then discovers and puts down the reanimated Alden.
