Overview
[
]


Yago is a relentless individual. He's willing to kill his enemies even at the cost of his fellow 
Saviors
. When 
Joey
 is taken hostage by 
Carol
, Yago only hesitates a little before firing at Joey in an attempt to get Carol. When 
Rick
 and 
Daryl
 interrogate him, he admits that the battle wasn't worth it before dying.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known of Yago's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Yago somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined.

Yago aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 8
[

"
Some Guy
"
[
]


During the war against the 
militia
, Yago and his fellow Saviors attempt to transfer the 50 cal machine guns from the 
current outpost
 to the 
Sanctuary
 when they spot 
Carol
 in the compound. Upon seeing her, they exchange bullets in a gunfight. Knowing she is outgunned, Carol pretends to surrender, and takes 
Joey
 as a hostage, forcing Yago and his comrades to sacrifice him in order to kill Carol unsuccessfully.

After Carol manages to take out two out of the four Saviors attacking her, Yago and another Savior take cover behind the vehicle containing the machine guns. Upon realizing Ezekiel is in trouble, she chooses to help him rather than kill Yago and his accomplice. Because of this, the two take this as an opportunity to flee the outpost on the truck. 

On the road, 
Rick
 and 
Daryl
 chase Yago and his companion where Daryl manages to take out the Savior manning the .50 Caliber gun on the back of the truck and 
Rick
 hijacks the vehicle and stabs Yago with his knife, injuring him and throwing him out of the vehicle onto the road.



"
The Big Scary U

While lying on the ground bleeding out, Yago is approached by Rick and Daryl who demand to know what happened at the chemical plant outpost, to which Yago angrily claims that only "
the king
, 
the lady with the short hair
, 
the axe man
" survived the battle after killing his people. After Daryl walks away, Yago succumbs to his wounds and dies. Rick then stabs him in the head to prevent reanimation.
