The only two other adult males killed in the cell block attack are portrayed by 
Greg Crews
 and 
Andrew Crigler
. Both confirmed that their characters were not named Mr. Richards as Greg Crews' character was named after himself and Andrew Crigler's character was only referred to as "Young Walker". This leaves Rob Fitts' elderly character from Woodbury as the only one who fits the role of Mr. Richards.
