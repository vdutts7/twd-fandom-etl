Season 2

"
Triggerfinger
"
[
]


After the rest of Dave and Tony's gang (Randall, Nate, and Sean) had heard gunshots, Sean and his party arrived to the town and start investigate. As Sean and Randall were searching the buildings and killed some walkers, they found a car that belongs to Dave and Tony but they're nowhere to be find. Once Sean and his party realized they weren't alone, they asked the survivors inside 
the bar
 if they have seen their friends. 
Rick Grimes
 answers that they're both dead, which causes a shoot-out to erupt between the two groups. Outside, when 
Glenn Rhee
 attempts to head to the car, Sean tries to kill both Glenn and 
Hershel Greene
, but Hershel was able to open fire first, and Sean is hit in the lower body. After several minutes of moaning in agony and calling for help on the ground, Sean is ultimately eaten by the advancing Walkers. Hershel attempted to save Sean by shooting the nearest walkers despite his actions of attempting to kill them at first, but more arrived and ultimately overran him.
