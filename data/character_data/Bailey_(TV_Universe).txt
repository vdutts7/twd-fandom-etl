Overview
[

Bailey is selfless and brave, being willing to put his life on the line for his friends and especially his girlfriend 
Aiden
. His first encounter shows him with an injured ankle, which was revealed to be because he was out looking for honey for Aiden. He is grateful to 
Michonne
 after she saves him and Aiden and joins her on her mission to find 
Rick
 despite the risk. Tragically, he ends up being bitten by a zombified Aiden despite being warned not to sleep next to her, implying that he didn't want to live without her.

"
What We Become
"
[
]


As 
Michonne Grimes
 and her pet walkers trudge through the wilderness, an injured Bailey and his companion 
Aiden
 suddenly emerge from the trees, startled to see Michonne. They cower in uncertainty and fear at first but Aiden pleads for help from Michonne, indicating they need to re-group with their caravan seen in the distance. She states that they need help and the caravan won't wait for them, to which Michonne agrees. After dispatching her pet walkers, she assists Bailey and Aiden and begin the trek to meet up with caravan.

"
Gone
"
[
]


Aiden, Bailey, and Michonne succeeded in getting back to the caravan and enter a meeting with Aiden's sister, 
Elle
. As Elle annoys Michonne by trying to get her to a join a community, 
Nat
 storms in and confronts Elle about leaving Aiden and Bailey behind. However, Aiden catches Nat's attention and the three are happily reunited. Bailey explains Michonne saved them after he hurt his ankle.

Later, Aiden and Bailey bring Michonne Elle's horse which is one of the best. Nat pleads with Michonne to spend the night so that he can properly equip her and show Michonne how to use the equipment properly. Michonne agrees and an excited Nat starts giving Aiden and Bailey orders on crafting something while he walks Michonne through the 
screamsticks
.

The next morning, as Michonne is about to set out, she questions why Bailey, Aiden, and Nat stay with the caravan if they don't like their rules. Bailey admits that they're just too scared to change. Michonne tells Aiden, Bailey and Nat that she's glad to have met them and they wish each other luck before Aiden and Bailey leave.

As Michonne is faced with a giant herd, two explosions go off and the herd splits, each half going towards one of the explosions, which opens the path for Michonne. Turning around, Michonne finds several of the caravan's vehicles and Aiden and Bailey leading Michonne's horse back over to her. Bailey explains that they were tired of the carvan's rules and left with others who felt the same way to look for her.

At night, the 
Nat's Group
 camps out and Michonne's friends tease her about getting knocked off of her horse by the Gasman. Michonne asks about the purple light, and Nat explains how Bailey and Aiden had wanted to go after Michonne which he finds to be insane for a multitude of reasons, but they'd had enough. Michonne thanks her friends, and Bailey thanks her in turn for waking them up, calling it a big move for himself and Aiden. Michonne promises Aiden, Bailey, and Nat that when she gets Rick, they will all come home with her to Alexandria. Bailey goes to get Aiden some food over her objections, which leads to Michonne realizing that Aiden is 
pregnant
. Aiden explains that she had been craving honey, which was why Bailey had been out there when Michonne found him and Aiden. Aiden starts crying, and Michonne comforts her, suggesting that Aiden and Bailey should head for Alexandria immediately with some of the others. However, Aiden tells Michonne that they will go there after she finds Rick.

As the group stops to clear an obstacle, a 
CRM
 helicopter flies overhead and drops 
Chlorine Gas
 bombs on the town. Recognizing the deadly gas, Nat yells orders for everyone to cover their mouths with fabric and to wet it with their canteens. Nat's Group quickly falls victim to the gas, dying and reanimating. Struggling to breathe in the toxic cloud, Nat picks the lock on 
an abandoned mall
 and Michonne, Aiden Bailey, and Nat enter. Michonne, Bailey and Nat help Aiden, who is the worst off, to a bed in the mall. Knowing that Aiden has a low chance of survival, Michonne orders Bailey to find something to tie his girlfriend to the bed, warning him not to fall asleep next to her.

Unfortunately, Aiden eventually dies and reanimates. Despite Michonne's warning, Bailey fell asleep next to Aiden and bit him, causing him to reanimate as well. Michonne finds a zombified Bailey reaching over a burning countertop, and stabs him through the head. She collapses along with his body in her severely weakened state.
