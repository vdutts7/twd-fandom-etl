Overview
[
]


Although he was only seen briefly, Barnes is shown to be a hot-headed, complaining, pessimistic, and ignorant individual. He is shown to be unhappy with 
Rick
's leadership and complains to 
Michonne
. He states that Rick brought them all out to die and that everyone is as good as dead. He also protests that Rick killed 
Carter
 despite the fact that Carter dying from a walker bite and Rick put him down out of mercy. Immediately after his protests, Barnes proves to be quite foolish, walking away from the rest of the group only to be bitten by a walker. Ironically, this is right after Rick stated not everyone is going to make it.



Pre-Apocalypse

]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Barnes' life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Barnes joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
.



Season 6
[
]


"
First Time Again
"
[
]


Barnes is among the volunteers to help build the wall on one of the roads to deter the mega herd in the operation to lure it away from Alexandria. One day as they are in mid-construction, he and the other Alexandrians are almost bitten by walkers until 
Morgan
 saves them after ignoring 
Rick
's suggestion of forcing the scared residents to learn how to defend themselves. When the walkers break free from the quarry and the plan is set into motion, Barnes and the others take immediate action.



"
Thank You
"
[
]


When a part of the herd ventures away from the road into the woods due to a 
blaring horn
 coming from Alexandria, the group runs through the woods in an attempt to return to the community. On the way, Barnes complains to 
Michonne
 about Rick's actions. As Rick makes a plan with 
Glenn
 and Michonne, a distracted Barnes is attacked by a walker and gets his throat ripped out. After the walker is put down, Michonne mercifully stabs Barnes through the head to end his suffering and prevent his reanimation.
