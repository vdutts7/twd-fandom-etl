Overview
[
]


Rodney generally seems to be a friendly person, but he is shown to have moments of foolishness. He, 
Gage
, and 
Addy
 are all initially welcoming to 
Henry
. However, Rodney immediately shows his juvenile behavior when he and Gage play with a walker they trapped, with Rodney peeing on it. Later, he and Gage make 
Lydia
 uncomfortable by lying to her that Addy has feelings for Henry, since Lydia herself has feelings for him. Most of his actions aren't done out of malicious intent and are more due to lack of maturity, as he is still young and growing up in the apocalypse. After being kidnapped by 
Alpha
, Rodney is shown to be terrified and is protected by 
Tammy
.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Rodney's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Rodney joined a community called the 
Hilltop Colony
.



Season 9
[
]


"
Evolution
"
[
]


Upon noticing a solitary 
Henry
 eating away from the other residents, Rodney and his friends call him to talk with them. He jokingly asks if all the residents at 
Oceanside
 are women and shortly after, they invite him to hang with them in the woods. 

That night, Henry drinks with his new friends in a shed outside of Hilltop. 
Gage
 suggests they have some more fun and takes them to a covered hole in the ground with a 
walker
 inside. 
Addy
 leaves as they throw rope rings at it and Rodney pees on it. Henry jumps in and mercy kills the walker. Gage is pissed at Henry for being a buzzkill and leaves him there.



"
Chokepoint
"
[
]


Rodney is part of 
Tara
's group in charge of clearing a tree from their path to the 
Kingdom
 to ensure the roads are cleared for 
Alden
's convoy carrying the food and trade goods for the fair. Upon finding a downed tree, Rodney remains alert and checks the surrounding area. He keeps on watch as the others help chop the tree into pieces to clear the road.

Later that day, a small 
herd
 of walkers approaches the group. They get in position and remind themselves to watch for the 
Whisperers
. Suddenly, 
the Highwaymen
 ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara after helping to take down the herd. They then escort them to the Kingdom, having accepted 
Carol
's deal. Upon arriving at the Kingdom, Rodney excitedly looks around with Gage and Addy.



"
The Calm Before
"
[
]


Rodney watches from the crowd as 
Ezekiel
 declares they've finally accomplished 
Rick
, 
Carl
, and 
Jesus
' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
“Let the fair of a new beginning begin!”
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. When Addy talks with Henry nearby, Rodney and Gage introduce themselves to Lydia and tell her that Addy has a thing for Henry, making her uncomfortable. However, she throws goat feces at them as payback.

At some point later that day, Rodney is somehow among the residents kidnapped by Alpha and taken away to a barn in the woods where they are about to be attacked by the Whisperers but are found by 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and 
D.J.
, giving the group a chance to fight back. During the fight, a scared Rodney is protected by 
Tammy.
 In the middle of the chaos, Alpha arrives and the group is subdued. She then decapitates everyone as 
Siddiq
 is forced to watch, only leaving him alive as a witness. Rodney's decapitated head is later put by Alpha on one of the several pikes used for the Whisperers' border.

The next day, 
Daryl
, 
Michonne
, Carol, Siddiq, and 
Yumiko
 find the border and watch in horror at the victims, a reanimated Rodney being among them. They then put down their zombified heads to properly rest. When the group returns to the Kingdom, Siddiq delivers the tragic news and narrates how Rodney and the others fought together as a family in their last moments. He finishes the story by encouraging everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.

Trivia
[
]


Rodney is the only pike victim who did not kill a member of the 
Whisperers
, whether that be direct, caused, or assumed.


Rodney's death is referenced in "
Silence the Whisperers
" when Margo pressures Gage to attack Lydia.


A zombified Rodney appears alongside 
Andrea Harrison
, 
Milton Mamet
, and 
Gareth
 in a commercial created by Ryan Reynolds, advertising products such as DoorDash, Autodesk, Ring, and Deloitte.


Rodney appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
A New Deal
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


The two children who witness Gregory's hanging in "
A New Beginning
" strongly resemble younger versions of Rodney and  
Adeline
. Whether or not this is them has yet to be confirmed.
