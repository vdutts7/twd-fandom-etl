Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Luke's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse


Season 4


"
30 Days Without An Accident
"


Luke is seen playing with some of the other children in the prison yard, naming the zombies at the fences. Later, Luke is at storytime listening to 
Carol
 read. When Carol pulls out the knives to teach how to use them, Luke asks to go on watch and Carol excuses him.



"
Infected
"


Luke is briefly seen trying to escape the walker incursion of cell block D. He is almost grabbed and eaten by a zombified prison resident, however 
Daryl
 comes to his aid and rescues him, carrying him away from the newly reanimating dead in one hand and firing a crossbow bolt into the attacking walker's head with his other. He is handed off to 
Karen
, and takes shelter in a cell with her, 
David
, 
Molly
, and another 
girl
.



"
Internment
"


Luke is among the prison residents to be quarantined in Cell Block A, indicating that he came down with the flu or symptoms of the flu. As the sick survivors rest in their cells, Luke passes the time playing checkers with 
Jeanette
 in a cell. When chaos breaks out in the cell and the residents begin dying off and reanimating, 
Hershel
 puts him and 
Lizzie
 in a cell as he goes to put down the zombified residents.



"
Too Far Gone
"


After the watch tower is blown up by the Governor, the prison residents are told to evacuate to the bus. Luke carries a bag of supplies and follows Molly and Mika, who are carrying Judith, as they head for the bus when Lizzie stops them and tells the group to be strong like Carol told them to, and not to be scared and weak. A short time later, after the bus was forced to leave before everyone could board, Luke and Molly go out into the prison yard alongside Lizzie and Mika, and 
one of the Governor’s men
 is shot and killed by Lizzie. After his death, Luke turns around and runs back into the prison, followed by Molly. Lizzie then executes 
Alisha
, and runs back after Luke and Molly into the prison with 
Mika
, despite 
Tyreese
‘s attempt to tell them they’re fleeing in the wrong direction. 



"
Inmates
"


Beth and Daryl come across several bodies beside the train tracks being eaten by walkers. Beth sees a child's shoe, and assumes them to be the bodies of Molly and Luke.

Trivia


In "
Inmates
", Beth and Daryl find children’s footprints in the woods, and Beth speculates they may belong to Luke or Molly. After finding the corpses and a bloody child’s shoe at the train tracks, Beth breaks down in tears, believing the children may have been killed.


The casting call used the name "Luke" for this character, though the name was later changed to something else. However, "Luke" was brought back as the character's name because of two reasons: Luke is the actor's name and is also 
Angela Kang
's brother's name.


While it was never confirmed, Luke Donaldson mentioned in an interview that people had speculated that Luke and Molly may have been siblings, and that they had come from Woodbury with the remaining townspeople after the failed prison assault (neither filmed for Season 3).
