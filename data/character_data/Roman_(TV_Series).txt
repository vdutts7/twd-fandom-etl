“


Each breath is getting harder, probably don't have too many more in me so I'm gonna make each one count. So here's how it's gonna go: You're gonna lie there and I'm gonna watch you die slow, just like my friends did back on that road. Just like I'm gonna. 
Let's see who wins, bitch.

Overview
[
]


Roman is an unsympathetic, brutal, and sadistic man. When he and his group confront 
Carol
, who puts on the facade of a helpless woman, Roman is unmoved when she begins to break down. However, Carol turns the tables on his group and kills them all. Roman manages to survive by playing dead. He is shown to be saddened by the death of his comrades and follows 
Rick
 and 
Morgan
's trail to get revenge on Carol. When Roman finds Carol, rather than merely shooting her, he attempts to give her a slow and painful death. When Morgan holds Roman at gunpoint and tells Roman to put down the gun. Despite being at a disadvantage, Roman unwisely decides to not put down the gun and aims to finish Carol off which prompts Morgan to shoot Roman multiple times.

At some point in the apocalypse, Roman somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined.

Jiro
 and tells him to let go. Roman struggles to get out of the car, before moving up the road. He hides as 
Rick
 and 
Morgan
 arrive at the site. When they leave, Roman exits the bushes on the other side of the road and picks up Carol's rosary beads before setting off in pursuit of her.
