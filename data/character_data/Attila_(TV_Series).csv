,,Nothing is known about Attila's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point during the outbreak, Attila joined a 
community
 in Ohio.
An announcer says to the crowd that the main event is about to begin: a wrestling match, which in truth is a staged fight between 
Captain Commonwealth
 versus Attila and 
Lothar
. Throughout the fight, the crowd cheers for Captain to beat Attila and Lothar and boos whenever him and Lothar get the upper hand. Eventually, however, Captain beats the two, and celebrates. Later, when chaos ensues and walkers enter the square, Attila flees to safety.
With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by 
Colonel Vickers
