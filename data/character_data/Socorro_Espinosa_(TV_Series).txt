Socorro Espinosa, affectionately known as "Coco", was born in May 2021 at the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 in Alexandria, 
Virginia
 to 
Rosita Espinosa
 and 
Siddiq
. Rosita was a soldier and Siddiq was the community doctor for Alexandria. While Rosita was in a committed relationship with

Though unseen, Coco is among the residents to evacuate Alexandria and relocate to an abandoned hospital referred to as the "
Tower
" where she and dozens of others seek refuge on the upper floors of the hospital. As a group of survivors enact a plan to lure the herd away, others defend the hospital from the Whisperers and snipe as many as they can from the windows. When the

Coco is heard screaming for help, when Rosita, Eugene & Gabriel come searching for her at the Commonwealth. She is placed under an overturned crib, while a walker attempts to claw its way in. Rosita comes in, killing the walkers and saving Coco. 

Later in the episode, Rosita straps Coco to her chest and begins to escape a surrounded ambulance. Rosita starts climbing a pipe on the side of a building, while walkers grab at her legs. All of a sudden, Rosita and Coco fall into the herd, disappearing from sight. Rosita reappears, slicing through the walkers, climbing the ambulance and jumping her & Coco to safety. 

When all seems well, Rosita is seen sitting with Coco. Eugene speaks to her about taking Coco to Oceanside next summer, so she can learn how to swim. Rosita reveals she's been bitten and wants to soak up every last moment she can with her daughter before she dies.

At the end of the episode, we see Coco and Rosita are sitting at the dinner table enjoying Rosita's final meal. Right before she passes away, she kisses Coco on the head and whispers, before Gabriel takes her out the room.

One year later, we see Coco is living at Alexandria, being raised by Gabriel. He refers to her as the "future".
