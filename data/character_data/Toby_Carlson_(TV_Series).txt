Overview
[
]


Toby initially seems to be a friendly and jovial individual, if not somewhat eccentric. Though at first he appears to be quite foolish, with his plan to recruit the people of 
Riverbend
 seeming to be unsafe, it is revealed to be ruse to take out the people from the inside and find the missing weapons. Toby reveals himself to be a brutal, violent, ruthless, and sadistic psychopath. After brutally interrogating 
Ian
, he mercilessly kills him and begins mocking his corpse before violently kicking it. He is shown somewhat lacking self-awareness, calling Ian a "damn animal," right after his unhinged behavior. He proceeds to push many Riverbend residents off the building and orders anyone who won't talk about the missing weapons to be killed, all while having a disturbingly casual and smug attitude, as well as never showing any remorse for his actions.

As a CIA Agent, Toby is an extremely skilled and dangerous individual. He is very deceitful and manipulative, shown while being held at gunpoint by Ian, he is able to come off as timid and afraid, only to strike right when Ian's guard is down. He has no qualms with betraying his own allies, such as ordering 
Jesse
 to be shot despite them seemingly having a friendly relationship before, along with 
Aaron
 and 
Gabriel
. Toby is also rarely ever intimidated, seen when after he tries to shoot Aaron only to find his gun is empty, he merely smiles and seemed more than ready to fight him one-on-one before Aaron was forced to flee. He has a proneness to angry outbursts when things do not go his way, with him often yelling in a rather childish manner.

Despite his brutality, it seemed that prior to the mission to Riverbend, Toby appeared to be living peacefully within the 
Commonwealth
 as the head recruiter. According to him, he enjoyed meditating and helping people. However, due to being a former CIA agent, he is recruited by 
Lance Hornsby
 to go to Riverbend to retrieve some missing weapons. He initially refuses but eventually caves in after Lance threatens to take away his happy life, along with hearing how young troopers in their 20s were being killed. Toby was most likely hesitant to go on the mission due to knowing that he will revert back to his brutal ways, which eventually happened.

After being surrounded by the 
group
, Toby reveals himself to be a coward, pleading for mercy despite preparing to kill Aaron and Gabriel seconds prior. Toby would meet a karmic death, falling off the building which he pushed many Riverbend residents off of and proceed to be devoured by said reanimated residents. In the end, while Toby tried to become a good person, he was forced back to his ruthless self by the corrupt Lance, causing him to die a brutal and disgraced man.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Toby's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he worked for the CIA for an unknown period of time.



Post-Apocalypse
[

Ohio
[
]


At some point during the outbreak, Toby joined the 
Commonwealth
 in Ohio and became head recruiter for the community.



Season 11
[
]


"
Warlords
"
[
]


Toby recruits 
Aaron
 and 
Gabriel
 to take point on an outreach mission with a community in an apartment complex to offer them membership with the Commonwealth. Toby scopes out the complex through binoculars. Aaron remarks that the building doesn't look as friendly as he'd been told but reassures Gabriel that they'll have Commonwealth troopers with them. Toby informs them that the troopers are hanging back to avoid spooking the settlers. Gabriel and Aaron refuse to go in, but Toby says it's not up for discussion.

Aaron announces himself at the building entrance and says they have MREs to offer. A 
woman
 steps out and collects their weapons before allowing them inside. She directs the group to a room down a dark hallway. Inside the room, the leader, 
Ian
, orders them to sit. Aaron describes the Commonwealth and invites Ian's group to join them. Ian shows them a collection of skulls from raiders who came to kill his group. He shoots his gun and orders them to kneel, worried they've come to eat his people. Aaron and Gabriel insist they aren't cannibals and offers to leave if Ian lets them go. Ian agrees, but Toby grabs his gun and shoots him and guns down his bodyguards. His whole demeanor has changed.

In a flashback to one week ago, 
Lance Hornsby
 summons Toby to his office. Lance explains that a convoy full of guns and cargo was en route to the three communities when it was hijacked by a religious group. Lance orders Toby to lead a surgical operation to retrieve the goods. Toby tells Lance that he's no longer an assassin, but Lance threatens to upend Toby's life if he refuses. He suggests Toby take Gabriel and Aaron.

In the present day, Toby interrogates Ian and demands to know where the guns and cargo are located. Ian says he has no idea what Toby is talking about. Toby beats him up. Gabriel punches Toby, prompting troopers to handcuff him. Toby shoots Ian dead, leading to a shocked Aaron telling him that they were supposed to help people, which Toby states that they are, by killing the threats and this is how to make the world safe. He then runs outside when he hears 
Jesse
 flee on horseback. Toby orders the trooper to kill Jesse, as the trooper shoots Jesse, but Aaron smashes him in the face before he can shoot again. Aaron escapes as more troopers arrive. Back inside, Toby discovers that Gabriel has escaped and his guard is dead.

Toby tells the residents of the complex that they are enemies of the Commonwealth because they stole from his community. Toby interrogates two hostages on the building roof and pushes them off the edge after they insist they know nothing about the stolen goods. One by one, he shoves more hostages off the roof. Toby orders his troopers to kill anyone in the building who won't talk.



"
The Rotten Core
"
[
]


Toby looks at the dead hostages that he pushed off the roof of the 
apartment complex
. The bodies start to reanimate. Toby radios Lance to let him know the location is secure and that they're searching for the hijacked goods. Toby leads a team through the complex, gunning down residents.

Toby leads troopers through the building. He orders his troopers to kill anyone who doesn't talk; if they don't find the guns, they burn Riverbend to the ground. Toby's team storms an apartment and finds nothing. Toby notices shoe prints leading to the secret room. Before he can investigate, he hears gunfire. Toby's team chases Gabriel and Aaron onto the roof and corners them. 
Elijah
 sneaks up and kills the troopers with his 
kamas
.

With his troopers dead and surrounded by Aaron's group, Toby attempts to plead for his life, but Aaron shoots Toby, who falls off of the roof and lands near the bodies of the dead hostages. They reanimate and eat Toby alive as Aaron and Gabriel watch. Toby is later put down by Maggie, Lydia, and Elijah along with his reanimated victims.

Lance
 visits 
Riverbend
 with 
Daryl
 and a detachment of 
Commonwealth soldiers
 to investigate the events that had occurred there. Toby's partially devoured corpse, surrounded by the now dead Riverbend residents who had devoured him and his own soldiers, is marked off. Lance expresses doubt about 
Aaron
 and 
Gabriel
's version of the events, but Daryl backs his friends up. Lance accuses Aaron and Gabriel of knowing the 
"crazed, violent strangers"
 responsible, but Gabriel tells him that Toby had lost control of the situation, they had barely survived and they won't take the fall for this.

Quotes

The following is a list of some of Toby's most memorable quotes.





Season 11




"You feel that? That mix of 
dopamine
 and 
adrenaline
 just- 
(excited noises)
 It's just that 
anticipation
. You, and you, and even you too, Jesse. Today, we're gonna make the world just a little better than it was yesterday. (…) You don't think so? (…) Okay, but what if they are? If they're angry, that just means they're afraid, but when they meet you, they won't be. I cannot wait to watch you two do your thing."
- Toby before going into Riverbend, "
Warlords
"





"I don't want to be on the shelf and I don't think you're 
stupid
!"
- Toby pretending to be scared of Ian, "
Warlords
"





"Oh man, I don't do that anymore, Lance. (…) I like being retired. I get up, I meditate, and I find people who need help and give 'em a second chance. It's 
Zen
. It feels great."
- Toby to Lance about wanting to stay retired, "
Warlords
"





"You um... you tired of living, Lance?"
- Toby threatening Lance, "
Warlords
" 





"Okay, okay, so we go in like we're making first contact and since they're religious... (…) And what about then things turn and I have to feel them what's what?"
- Toby discussing the plan with Lance, "
Warlords
"





"The guns in the cargo you hijacked. The ones that you massacred my soldiers to get too. Where are they? (…) You just lied to me."
- Toby interrogating Ian, "
Warlords
"





"Ready the shelf warlord. Top shelf, dead center, how does that sound? Right above Billy. Hey! Hey, where'd you go huh? All that talk and you 
died so quick
."
- Toby taunting Ian's corpse, "
Warlords
"





"Don't look at me like that. He's a 
damn animal
."
- Toby to Aaron after he kicks Ian's corpse "
Warlords
"

 of it. 
Snuffing out threats

Warlords
"





"I turn my back for one 
goddamn minute
!"
- Toby after Gabriel escapes, "
Warlords
"





"Residents of the Complex. You have been deemed 
enemies
 of the Commonwealth. One of you has stolen from us. That cannot be stand. Bad news is, your warlord is 
dead
. The good news is, you can still make things right. Give us what's ours and we'll leave! That'll be that!"
- Toby to the residents of Riverbend, "
Warlords
"





"Location secured brother. (…) We're searching floor by floor, the residents haven't been very 
cooperative
. (…) Yeah well, small taste of some law and order will help them remember."
- Toby radioing Lance, "
The Rotten Core
"





"Anyone you find, they refuse to give you something useful you just 
pop them
 in the head and move on. We find our guns in the next hour or we burn this place to the ground."
- Toby to his soldiers, "
The Rotten Core
"





"Just enough of this 
shit
! What are you even thinking? Huh? Just turning on me, on the Commonwealth, for what? Some 
tenement warlord
 and all these thieving followers? I just- I really thought you were 
smarter
 than all that!"
- Toby after cornering Aaron and Gabriel, "
The Rotten Core
"





"All troopers up to the roof now! 
Commander needs assistance
! (…) Oh ho, okay, okay. Woo. That's good. Wisdom to know the difference right?"
- Toby to Aaron and Gabriel after he has been cornered, "
The Rotten Core
"





"Look, things just got a little out of hand. We all just need to... take a 
breath
, all right? Listen... listen, we just need to talk things-
- Toby to the group before he is shot off the building by Aaron, "
The Rotten Core
"
