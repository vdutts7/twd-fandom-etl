After that, we decided to protect ourselves, no matter what. No matter who we crossed, we would 
kill
 on sight. We left our old home with just the 
clothes
 on our backs. And then we found this 
place
. We would stay hidden. And we would stay 
alive

Overview
[
]


Natania has shown herself to be a highly intelligent, caring, and stubborn woman who is a determined survivor and a strong leader to those in her group. Natania has shown extreme devotion to the safety and well-being of her people and family, and she appears to be willing to do anything in order to keep her group safe from danger, even if it includes resorting to violence.

After losing a majority of her group to 
Simon
 and his group following their failed rebellion, Natania grew into a more hardened and paranoid individual and she refused to allow her group to be enslaved and punished again and therefore escaped Negan's tyranny with her group and built a new community, 
Oceanside
. Natania, however, remained fearful of the Saviors and she viewed them as being unstoppable and therefore to prevent the Saviors from finding her group again, any stranger that encountered her group was slaughtered on her orders. She completely refuses to join 
Rick
 and his 
people
 in fighting the Saviors as she refuses to lose to them again and simply allows them to rob her and her people of their weapons, showing that she is willing to make extreme sacrifices in order to avoid conflicts with the Saviors again.

Eventually, her stubbornness and cruelty towards outside members of her group would lead to her death at Enid's hand.

Location Unknown
[

Nothing is known about Natania's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had at least one daughter and two grandchildren.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


Natania, her daughter, and her two grandchildren survived the early stages of the outbreak and eventually formed a community of survivors situated at Hollowbranch where they enjoyed a peaceful existence under Natania's leadership. Unfortunately, her group would be discovered by a large, hostile¬†
organization of survivors
¬†led by 
Simon
 (who later became 
Negan
's ruthless and sadistic second-in-command) and under his orders, Natania and her people were forced to gather and provide supplies for them under threat of death. Eventually, under her orders, the group initiated a rebellion to fight back against their oppressors. However, due to being outgunned and outnumbered, their group was defeated and suffered many casualties, with Natania's daughter being among them. As punishment for their defiance and to deter any further resistance, Simon had his group murder every male survivor above the age of 10, with Natania's grandson being executed by a woman named Arat.

Following this and being unwilling to continue working for Simon and his group, Natania and her group, consisting mainly of females now, fled their community and established a new home at a location called 
Oceanside
 and reestablished their community hidden from them. In order to prevent Simon and his group from finding them again, Natania ordered any survivor who happened upon the community to be immediately killed in order to maintain the secrecy of their new home.

"
Swear
"


When a stranger named 
Tara
 stumbles upon Oceanside,¬†Natania allows her to live after not deeming her as a threat and because she spared 
Beatrice.
 That night, the women have supper and attempt to persuade Tara to stay with them in Oceanside. However, Tara wants to go back home to her 
girlfriend
 and the women offer to escort Tara back to the bridge where she last saw her companion 
Heath
.  After Tara reveals that her group killed a group of bandits at a 
satellite station
, Natania secretly orders Beatrice and 
Kathy
 to kill her. The next morning, Natania bids farewell to Tara as she is escorted into the woods. However, Cyndie disobeys her grandmother and helps Tara escape safely.



"
Something They Need
"


In the following weeks, Tara leads her 
group
 to Oceanside to gather guns from the community's armory. When bombs begin to go off in the outskirts of Oceanside, Natania is held hostage by Tara in her house along with Cyndie. She begs them to talk to 
Rick Grimes
, her leader, and join their resistance. When Rick and the other¬†Alexandrians¬†set off bombs on the outskirts of the community, Natania and Cyndie manage to subdue Tara and take her as their hostage.

As Natania holds Tara at gunpoint and refuses to accept Rick's proposal, Cyndie realizes her grandmother is mistaken and knocks her out. After the Survivors and the Oceansiders join forces to help defend the community from walkers, Natania still refuses her people to join the war but angrily allows the Survivors to take their guns.
