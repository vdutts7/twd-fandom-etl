Overview
[
]


Olivia is a kind-hearted, soft, and sweet woman. Like most of the Alexandrians, she is a weak survivor due to her lack of experience outside the walls. During the 
Wolves
' attack it's revealed that she doesn't know how to shoot a gun. She is shown to be easily pushed around, as she is unable to prevent several residents from raiding the food of the pantry.

Overtime, Olivia is shown to become more brave. She helps the group clear out a giant herd inside 
Alexandria
. However, she is still shown to be quite timid, as she is very intimidated by 
Negan
. She is the victim of many demeaning jokes from Negan, causing her to cry. Eventually she gains the courage to slap him in the face.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Not much is known regarding Olivia's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had worked seven years at a coffee shop and cured meats in her basement. She also attended school for hotel and hospitality training.
[1]




Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Olivia joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where, upon being interviewed by 
Deanna
, she was appointed as the weapons and supplies inventory manager.

When a lonely girl named 
Enid
 arrived at the community, Olivia granted her asylum in her house and they lived together.



Season 5
[
]


"
Remember
"
[
]


After 
Rick
 and 
Rick's group
 arrive in Alexandria, Olivia collects their weapons and stores them at the armory while joking that she should have gotten a bigger cart for the guns. Later that day, she witnesses the fight between 
Aiden
 and newcomer 
Glenn
 at the town's gates.



"
Forget
"
[
]


Olivia is woken up early one day by newcomer 
Sasha
 to gain access to the armory. As they head to the weapons locker, she talks about her previous job and asks for a leg from a boar to cure meat if Sasha comes across one in the woods. Later that day, Olivia is with newcomer 
Carol
 in the pantry gathering ingredients for Carol to make cookies and then signs out a couple of weapons for 
Tobin
 and another man. That night, she attends Deanna's welcoming party for the new arrivals and socializes with the other residents and the new arrivals.



Season 6
[
]


"
First Time Again
"
[
]


Olivia is at the armory with Tobin, 
Spencer
, and 
Francine
, listening to 
Carter
's plan to kill Rick and take over Alexandria. When Rick discovers the complot, everyone accuses Carter of being the only culprit.



"
JSS
"
[
]


Olivia is at the pantry with Carol, 
Erin
, and 
Shelly
 talking about different recipes. When 
the Wolves
 attack Alexandria later that day, Olivia hides in a closet at the armory until she is found by Carol, who enters to gather guns. Before leaving, Carol arms Olivia with a gun and instructs her to shoot anyone she doesn't know who tries to break into the house.



"
Now
"
[
]


Having survived the assault made on the community by the Wolves, Olivia is one of the many townspeople by the front gate, listening to the growing horde gathering outside the walls. She appears to be very concerned about the situation and listens to Rick and 
Aaron
 as they address the crowd. Afterwards, Olivia unsuccessfully attempts to prevent several residents from raiding the food of the pantry, though eventually Spencer steps in and is able to calm everyone down. Later that day, she watches in horror as 
Jessie
 is forced to put down a zombified 
Betsy
.



"
Heads Up
"
[
]


Olivia is sitting on the staircase of the armory reading a book when suddenly she hears a noise from the pantry. She investigates the pantry and finds that a shelf toppled over. As she begins to clean up the mess, 
Ron
 sneaks behind her and steals some bullets from the armory.



"
No Way Out
"
[
]


Olivia takes shelter inside 
Eric
's house along with him when the herd invades the community. That night, they witness Rick and other residents slaughtering walkers in the streets and are inspired to join the group where they battle the entire herd for hours until dawn when all the walkers are finally killed.



"
Twice as Far
"
[
]


Several weeks after the invasion, Olivia opens the pantry as usual for residents to come by to retrieve rations. After 
Denise
's death, she helps prep the weapons carts to be taken out for an unspecified use by the townspeople.



Season 7
[
]


"
Service
"
[
]


Olivia opens the door of the armory when 
the Saviors
 arrive as she was expecting them to come by eventually. She hands over the inventory to 
Arat
 and watches as they take all of the weapons. However, things get heated as Arat reveals two guns are missing, and her life is threatened by 
Negan
 if those guns are not turned over. As Rick holds a meeting with the townspeople, Olivia is held hostage by Negan. Eventually, the guns are found and a tearful Olivia is released.



"
Sing Me a Song
"
[
]


When Negan returns to Alexandria to deliver back 
Carl
, Olivia answers the door. Negan asks her about Rick's whereabouts, and Olivia nervously tells Negan that Rick is out scavenging and might not return that day. She adds that she and the other Alexandrians are practically starving due to the Saviors taking their supplies, prompting Negan to make a comment on her weight. Olivia starts crying, and Negan apologizes and offers to have sex with her while they wait for Rick. In response, Olivia slaps Negan, but he laughs it off before taking a tour of Rick's house after ordering her to prepare some lemonade.



"
Hearts Still Beating
"
[
]


While waiting for Rick's return to Alexandria, Olivia, besides taking care of 
Judith
, is forced to obey to Negan's personal demands. When Tara brings her some lemonade powder from her kitchen and offers to take her place in watching over Judith, Olivia declines since she already promised that to Rick and walks inside the Grimes' house where she makes lemonade and sits down to eat spaghetti along with Judith, Carl, and Negan. 

Later that day, when Negan and Spencer play pool, Olivia watches on the porch with Carl. After Negan kills Spencer, 
Rosita
 attempts to kill Negan and accidentally shoots 
Lucille
 instead. As a result, Negan demands Rosita to tell him who made the bullet. After lying twice, Negan orders Arat to "
kill someone
", and Olivia is promptly shot in the face despite Rosita's pleas.
