Overview
[
]


Terry seems to be an affable and humorous individual. He was very close with 
Michonne
 and 
Mike
, the latter whom was his best friend. However, one day when Terry and Mike got high, walkers attacked their camp and killed Michonne's 
son
 and themselves. As punishment, Michonne kept Terry and Mike as walkers.



Pre-Apocalypse

Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


Little is known about Terry's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was good friends with 
Mike
 and Michonne. He does appear to have had an interest in art, and as evidenced by a conversation during a dream, his tastes differed from that of Michonne's.

Seed

After Michonne comes back from her supply run for medicine, she enters the local game cooler where Michonne, Andrea and a reanimated Mike and Terry have been taking refuge in.

After a helicopter crashes, Andrea and Michonne go to investigate it. Michonne chains the reanimated Mike and Terry to a tree. A group of armed men arrive, and Michonne and Andrea hide in the bushes to watch them. Mike and Terry begin to make too much noise, and Michonne decapitates them to prevent their location being compromised leaving their reanimated heads on the ground.

The reanimated heads of Mike and Terry are later are being experimented on by 
Milton Mamet
 in his laboratory. Milton tells him about Michonne's walkers, about how they starved and were being used as camouflage.

the Governor's apartment
 waiting to kill him, she hears a rustling and discovers a aquarium full of decapitated walker heads including Terry's zombified head.

The episode opens with a flashback to when Michonne and Andrea were camping in the winter. As the two eat, Andrea asks about her pet walkers, Mike and Terry.
