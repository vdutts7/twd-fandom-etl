Overview
[
]


Emmett is an intelligent doctor and seems to be one of the friendlier people at the 
Sanctuary
. He was originally part of the 
Hilltop Colony
 with his 
brother
, but was taken by the 
Saviors
 to be their doctor. Since then he has been loyal to Negan. He's very friendly to 
Sherry
 and 
Dwight
. However, despite being nothing but nice to Dwight, after Sherry escapes with Daryl, Dwight frames Emmett being the one who let her out. Emmett begs for Negan to not burn him and even falsely confesses to a crime he didn't even commit. Though initially it seems like Emmett is let off the hook, Negan burns him in the furnace.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


Emmett grew up in Virginia alongside his brother 
Harlan
, where together they enrolled in Medical school where throughout their studies they gained a distinct education regarding medical methods and procedures. While Harlan became an 
obstetrician
, Emmett became a pledged physician.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Emmett and Harlan survived the early stages of the outbreak and took residence in a 
FEMA
 camp where they were later evacuated to a safe-zone named the 
Hilltop Colony
, upon where Emmett settled into the farming community where he became integrated with the fellow residents, most notably 
Gregory
 and 
Paul Rovia
, and thus became a prominent member. It's possible he also served as one of the community's doctors. 

Emmett was present at the time of the arrival of 
the Saviors
, a notorious group of survivors who demanded half of the Hilltop's supplies in exchange for leaving the farming community unscathed. Though initially reluctant to comply the Saviors demonstrated their motives through publicly executing a 16-year-old resident 
Rory
. Following this barbaric event, the colony entered into a period of dread and submission and thus were forced to comply under 
Negan Smith
's rule, were due to their limited resources and manpower they were unable to rebel against their savage oppressors.

At some point after this event, Emmett was forcefully separated from his brother and was taken away to the Sanctuary to serve as the Saviors' main doctor at their headquarters. 



Season 7
[
]


"
The Cell
"
[
]


Dr. Carson is finishing up an examination with 
Sherry
 regarding a possible pregnancy when 
Dwight
 enters the room with 
Daryl
. He tells Daryl that things will get better and that 
Negan
 will take care of him as he tends to his wounds.



"
Sing Me a Song
"
[
]


Dr. Carson is present when Negan makes an example out of 
Mark
 and tends to his injury after he irons his face as punishment for breaking the rules.



"
Hostiles and Calamities
"
[
]


Dr. Carson attends Dwight after he is beaten by a group of Saviors following Daryl and Sherry's escape. He discusses getting to know Sherry when he performed check-ups for her. When Dwight returns from a run later that day, he has his bandages replaced and listens as Dr. Carson shares his opinion on if he thinks Sherry is the one who let Daryl go. He changes his bandage and at one point Dwight puts Sherry's note in his desk to make him take the blame.

When the Saviors and workers surround the furnace, Negan turns and whacks 
Lucille
 against Carson's shoulder. He shows him the note from Sherry, which reads: "Goodbye. Honey". Dr. Carson accuses Dwight of lying, but he quickly folds and falsely confesses when Negan threatens him with the iron. He begs Negan to not iron his face and apologizes to him. Negan stares intently at 
Eugene
 before he grabs Carson and throws him face-first into the furnace, killing him.
