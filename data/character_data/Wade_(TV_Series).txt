Overview
[
]


Very little is known about Wade, except that he is a high-ranking member of the 
Saviors
 and is very loyal to them. He is the Savior to lead the hunt for 
Dwight
, 
Sherry
, and 
Tina
 and is extremely condescending when they find them. However, he does seem to care about the lives of his men and is willing to retreat if it means saving them. After one of his men, 
Cam
, is bitten by a walker, Wade quickly comes to his aid and amputates his arm, before calling off the mission despite how close they are to capturing Dwight's group. He also has a somewhat sarcastic and monotone attitude, telling the Savior on the radio they're leaving because, 
"Cam got a boo-boo,"
 and tells Cam to walk it off.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Wade's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Wade somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as one of Negan's personal lieutenants. Over time, Wade aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 6
[
]


"
Always Accountable
"
[
]


Wade is the leader of the search party hunting for 
Dwight
, 
Sherry
, and 
Tina
. While looking for them, 
Cam
, a member of his party, is distracted by 
Daryl
 and gets bitten on the forearm by a walker. Wade then amputates Cam's arm and takes him away after taking his watch as well.



Season 9
[
]


"
Who Are You Now?
"
[
]


In the many skirmishes against the Saviors, including the various battles during the All Out War, hundreds of Saviors have been killed. While Wade has not been seen since the incident in the woods, it can be assumed he was killed during the war at some point by the Militia.

 promised that he would make a return as Wade in
