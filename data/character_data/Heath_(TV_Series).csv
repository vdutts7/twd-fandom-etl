,,"Heath has been described as an intelligent, cynical, and serious-minded guy with a level of disbelief and dislike for the stupidity he often encounters. The only thing he has that passes for humor is his occasional sarcasm. He is not angry or ill-tempered; he just thinks that people can be (and often are) very dumb. If pressed, he would reluctantly admit that he thinks most people have the potential to be good. Heath represents the divide between that of the Alexandrians and Rick Grimes ' group, as, despite his experience in supply runs, he has not yet faced the horrific circumstances that Rick and his group have experienced, causing some friction between the two groups. Despite this, Heath has proven to show great care, determination, and loyalty towards his fellow survivors as shown by refusing to leave Scott and Annie behind and generally believes in safety in numbers. Heath, like Glenn, was shown to be very hesitant to kill another living person, as he was initially unable to do so when they raided the Savior's compound. Seeing his hesitation, Glenn, who had just killed a person for the first time, did it for him rather than force Heath to try to bring himself to do it. But, he later showed that he is willing to kill, but it was only done in the heat of the moment when he was almost killed. Unlike the man he couldn't bring himself to kill, it was in self-defense rather than while his victims were sleeping.",Nothing is known about Heath's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"From the early start of the outbreak, Heath had been participating in supply runs providing him with the knowledge and capability to operate in severe situations. At some point later, Heath made his way to the Alexandria Safe Zone where he settled into the community, and upon being interviewed by Deanna Monroe he was officially assigned as a supply runner alongside Scott and Annie of whom the three became close friends as well as a prominent supply run team and thus became an effective asset to the community. During an early scouting Heath's team was assigned to survey the area around Alexandria where they discovered a large camp near a quarry which had been overrun with around 'a dozen' walkers which had been blocked by several trucks. At some point after being separated from Tara, Heath was captured by the Scavengers and traded to the Civic Republic Military in exchange for supplies.","This list shows the victims Heath has killed: Young Boy (Zombified, alongside his fellow Alexandrians) 5 unnamed Saviors (Alongside Glenn ) Numerous counts of zombies","For a more in-depth look at Heath's relationships, read here: Heath (TV Series)/Relationships",,"For more images of Heath, please visit Heath (TV Series)/Gallery .","The casting call for this character used the name Delvin . Heath was described as ""Early 20s. African-American.
