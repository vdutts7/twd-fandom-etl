Overview
[
]


Dog is brave and loyal to his allies who he has grown an attachment too. He never shies away from danger and always listens to his owner, 
Daryl Dixon
. To his enemies, Dog can be quite vicious, going in to bite them if it means protecting his allies.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


Dog was born in 2016 by his mother, who was part of a group of former U.S. military soldiers surviving in the post-apocalypse. Dog was born on the day when their group was overrun and escaped with a woman, 
Leah
, and her adopted son, 
Matthew
. Leah found a cabin in the woods, but then discovered that Matthew had been bitten. He later died, was put down by Leah, and buried on the land. Leah then named the pup Dog and was her only companion. At some point after he was born, his mother also died. 

A couple of months later, as a puppy, Dog ran off and found a man named 
Daryl Dixon
 camped out by a nearby river.



Season 9
[

"
Stradivarius
"
[
]


At some point after 
Rick Grimes
' apparent death, 
Daryl
 went to live in the woods and found the dog, eventually adopting and raising it. He merely names him "Dog".

Six years later, Daryl escorts 
Carol
 and 
Henry
 to his camp by a dam. As he feeds Dog, Carol asks him when was the last time he ate. 
"Dog ate yesterday"
, he says and walks off.

At night, as Carol gives Daryl a haircut, Dog leaves to walk around. Later, as they have dinner, Henry asks Daryl how he got his scar on the eye but he ignores him and leaves to find Dog.

Henry tails Daryl and finds a 
walker
 instead. Daryl shows up and asks if he was following him. Suddenly, Daryl hears Dog barking wildly nearby and rushes over to find it stuck in a trap and surrounded by walkers. Daryl picks off the walkers to save Dog and before a walker can bite him, Henry jumps in and saves him. 
"I told you to stay back"
, Daryl scolds. Back at the camp, Daryl pets Dog as he talks with Henry about moving to 
Hilltop
. 

In the morning, Daryl loads up his bike for Hilltop and Carol seems overjoyed she convinced him to come. They drive to Hilltop with Dog riding with Carol and Henry on their cart. Later, they arrive at Hilltop and hug 
Tara
. 
Aaron

Eugene

With Dog leading the way, Daryl, Aaron, and 
Jesus
 head out to find Eugene.

At an abandoned building, Daryl locks Dog in a closet with Lydia to protect her in case 
the Whisperers
 get past them. As Henry is almost killed by a Whisperer, Dog begins growling so a desperate Lydia breaks down the door for him to save Henry. Dog tackles the Whisperer off of Henry and begins savaging him, allowing Henry to finish the job by bashing the Whisperer's head in as Dog attacks. After the Whisperers are defeated, Daryl and his group leave for 
Alexandria
 to get Henry medical attention before they move on again.

Negan immediately follows after Judith, finally finding her by following Dog's barking to where he has gotten tangled up.

The next day, as Daryl wanders through a field, the Reaper follows him, spotting Dog nearby as well, sniffing around the grass. Hearing Dog's barking, Daryl finds him with the Reaper who is holding Dog by the collar and Daryl orders the Reaper to let Dog go, drawing his knife. The Reaper releases Dog and removes her mask, revealing herself to be
