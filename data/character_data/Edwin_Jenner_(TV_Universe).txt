Overview
[
]


Despite only appearing in two episodes, Edwin was shown to be a highly intelligent, determined, and caring person who was dedicated to his career as a virologist and was also a loving husband to his beloved wife, Candace. In contrast to his colleagues who either fled the CDC during the start of the outbreak or took their lives, Jenner chose to stay behind and work for as long as he could, although it was later revealed that he only did this at his dying wife's request, not because he wanted to.

Despite being safely sheltered from the apocalyptic hell occurring outside the CDC, Jenner was extremely well aware of the utter horrors and cruelty of the new world and viewed it as being mankind's extinction event and that staying alive was pointless as a painful death was inevitable. Jenner believed so strongly in this that he attempted to trap Rick and his group in the failing, set-to-detonate CDC complex to offer them a peaceful death, although after hearing their protests to try for as long as they could, Jenner agreed to give them a chance. He appeared pleased that the group managed to escape before meeting his demise alongside 
Jacqui
.

As revealed in a video message, before his wife's death, Jenner was far more optimistic and excited about his research into stopping the 
Wildfire Virus
. Jenner goes so far as to tell his French colleagues in the video message that 
"the day will come when we beat this"
, something that his wife kept telling him. Jenner's more subdued, depressed and suicidal state appears to have been brought on by Candace's death.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


Edwin worked alongside his wife, 
Candace Jenner
 and the computer-AI 
Vi
 at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. He knew a fair deal about the building and facility as well as safety protocols and decontamination steps.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the onset of the outbreak, Jenner, alongside his wife, and their colleagues in the CDC attempted to find a cure to reverse the outbreak however the situation only worsened despite their efforts and many of his colleagues either fled the CDC to be with their families or committed suicide. 

At some point, Candace was bitten and infected and decided to donate her body to be studied in the hopes of developing a cure. Before her death, Candace begged her husband to keep trying to find a cure for as long as he could and Jenner reluctantly agreed at his wife's request. Candace then died and Jenner put her down. He recorded her death and reanimation time, timing it exactly as two hours, one minute, seven seconds. 

For the next 63 days, Jenner worked completely isolated in the fortified CDC trying to develop a cure, having only the CDC's main computer VI for interaction. During this time, he lost all contact with the outside world and was unaware if there were other research facilities still functioning however he learned that scientists in France were the last to hold out. He also armed and trained himself with discarded military weapons.

"
Wildfire
"


Dr. Jenner was seen making video log entries about his work and research while working with samples in order to find a cure. On day 63 of the global outbreak, after starting the day's work to find a cure, Jenner reached for something and accidentally tipped a vial over, the acidic contents of which landed on an exposed tissue sample. This caused toxic fumes, causing the lab to go into a full decontamination mode which destroyed the last remaining specimen. In despair, Jenner decided to get drunk on wine and was contemplating shooting himself in the head. When the Atlanta group showed up at the CDC's doors, he reluctantly let them in after watching survivor 
Rick Grimes
 face the security camera and beg for someone to let them in.



"
TS-19
"


Edwin met the survivors in the lobby of the CDC and demanded a blood test from all of them to check if they have been infected, saying that it was standard procedure and locked down the front doors permanently. After clearing everyone, he invited them to make themselves comfortable, showing that they had electricity, food, beds, and hot water, all amenities that the survivors have not had for a long time.

Later, everyone dined with Edwin and they bombarded him with questions. In answer, he brought the group to the control room and talked about the CDC and how he was the last researcher alive after the rest of the doctors and staff committed suicide - as Jenner put it, "opting out...".

From the control room, Jenner showed the Atlanta survivors a video of "Test Subject 19's" brain, which offered a picture of the infection and how it affected a person's brain before, during, and after death. It was later revealed that TS-19 was his wife, Candace, the head of research at the CDC who was infected and devoted her failing body to research in an attempt to find a cure.

When 
Dale Horvath
 asked about the countdown timer on the wall, Dr. Jenner replied that it was counting down to when the generators in the basement would run out of fuel, prompting an explosion set to destroy the entire CDC. Jenner then closed the doors to the computer lab. The survivors panicked and attempted to flee, but Dr. Jenner sealed the exit doors of the control room, reminding them of his words when he let them in ("When I close those doors, they won't open again."). He claimed that it was no use anyway since he could not do anything to open the doors to the outside. This caused outrage from the trapped group. He tried to comfort them, saying that the explosion would be peaceful and virtually instantaneous, and Shane attempted to kill him.

Jenner relented after Rick and Carol made a passionate argument and unlocked the control room doors, allowing the survivors to try and find a way out. Before Rick left with the rest of the survivors, Dr. Jenner whispered something inaudible to the audience into his ear. 
Jacqui
 was the sole member of the Atlanta group who decided to stay behind with him as the building explodes. 
Andrea
 also decided to stay, but 
Dale
 convinced her to come with the rest of the group. Dr. Jenner and Jacqui proudly watch the group on the monitors escaping the building, and together they hold hands as the building explodes, killing them both.

"
The Last Light
"


In 
France
, a female 
scientist
 watches a recorded message of Jenner talking about the difficulty that the CDC is dealing with with samples of the zombie contagion. He also expresses awe at the work that the French scientists have done with cardiac plaques in their experiments. The scientist is interrupted by a 
man
 who kills her from what the woman and her fellow scientists have done.

After the woman's death, the recorded Jenner asks for more information about the 
"variant cohorts"
 that the French scientists had mentioned in their last communication, something that the scientists in America haven't seen anything close to. Jenner expresses hope that the day will come when they beat this thing which is what 
the other
 Dr. Jenner, who is smarter than Jenner, keeps telling him. Jenner signs off as the woman reanimates into a faster, stronger and more aggressive kind of zombie than in the United States.

Trivia
[
]


The name Edwin Jenner is a nod to Dr. Edward Anthony Jenner, the English researcher who discovered the smallpox vaccine in 1796.


In 
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct
, at the Atlanta football stadium where the evacuation is taking place, radio communications can be heard from the first helicopter taking off stating that a person named "Jenner" has been evacuated.


The episode title "
The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
" is a reference to Edwin's words to Rick after he thanks him for saving his group's lives by allowing them to escape the CDC.


Edwin is the last character to die in 
Season 1
, along with 
Jacqui
.


Despite being a scientist, Jenner does not rule out the possibility that the walker virus is of supernatural origin as seen when Jacqui suggests "the wrath of God" is a possible cause of the virus to which Jenner replies 
"there is that"
.


Edwin is one of the two 
TV Universe
 characters to appear in both 
The Walking Dead
 and 
World Beyond
, the other being 
Anne
.


Jenner's appearance in 
World Beyond
 aired exactly 11 years after his final appearance in 
The Walking Dead
.


Jenner has the last line in 
World Beyond
, saying goodbye in French in a video message to his colleagues in France.


Noah Emmerich
's guest appearance credit for "
The Last Light
" occurs directly after the mid-credits scene in which he appears, likely to keep Jenner's return a surprise.
