Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Katy somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which she subsequently joined.

Katy aided her group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to 
Negan Smith
's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.

Monsters

Katy is tied up and sorted into one of four chain gangs. She and the other prisoners of war are transported along a rural highway to the 
Hilltop
 when a swarm of walkers falls down a hill where they attack the Saviors and militia. In the chaos, a chain gang flees. Katy calls for the Saviors in her chain gang to follow them, and attempts to flee, but 
Alden
 subtly trips her, heeding the chain gang's escape. As a result, they are unable to flee and taken back into custody. After arriving at the Hilltop, they are let inside and corralled into two trailers in the back of the settlement.

The King, the Widow, and Rick
"
[

Katy is among the captured Saviors sitting outside the Hilltop as their fates are discussed by 
Maggie
 and the others. Ultimately, she is allowed to stay at the Hilltop in a makeshift prison that was built when Maggie chooses to side with 
Jesus
 over 
Gregory
. However, she and the others are only being kept alive as bargaining chips and will be killed off if there are no prisoners to be released by the Saviors.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"
[
]


Katy and the other Saviors remain in the prison when Maggie demands 
Dean
 to be let out. She watches as Alden attempts to dissuade Maggie from what she's about to do, but Maggie suddenly shoots Dean in the face, killing him. Katy and the others watch on as Maggie threatens Alden and Dean's body is taken away.

When 
Simon
 confronts the survivors at the Hilltop, the survivors bring out Katy, 
Jared
, Alden, and the other Saviors onto the balcony, to show that Maggie has bargaining power of her own. However, she and the others are abandoned by Simon before the Saviors launch their attack. She is among the people wounded with an arrow before bring evacuated inside the Barrington House. The next day, Katy is back in the makeshift prison with the other Saviors when she turns and attacks several Saviors. In the ensuing chaos, the rest of the Saviors escape the Hilltop. The zombified Katy is later found and put down by 
Siddiq
 when he checks on the prisoners.
