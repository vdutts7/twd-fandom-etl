When my

Overview
[
]


David is a caring and selfless man, who does what he can to protect his family. In the early stages of the outbreak, he had saved his 
daug
hters
 and 
granddaughter
 and protected them as long as he could before his lung cancer got the better of him. Even when sick, he still puts his family before himself, always trying to cheer them up. Eventually he dies from his illness and is put down by 
Philip Blake
.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Little is known about David's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he has two daughters, 
Tara
 and 
Lilly
, and a young granddaughter, 
Meghan
. David once served in a war and worked as a Gorbelli's food truck driver. At some point before the outbreak, he was diagnosed with 
lung cancer
. When he first heard about the outbreak, he was working and managed to pick up Meghan, Lilly, and Tara before barricading them inside of an apartment building in a small town.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Season 4
[
]


"
Live Bait
"
[
]


Lilly mentioned to 
the Governor
, at this time known as the pseudonym 
Brian Heriot
, that, when the outbreak first began, David drove his food truck to pick-up his daughters and granddaughter from their work and school and the family was able to survive off of the non-perishable foods that were in David's truck at the time.

Following the apocalypse, David lived with his daughters Tara and Lilly, and his granddaughter, Meghan. He had 
lung cancer
 and was not expected to live as long as he had. He died in bed at home. Due to their seclusion and consequent inexperience with walkers, his daughters were not aware that everyone turns regardless of the cause of death, so he turned and attacked Tara. The Governor put him down. After that, they buried his body and left the apartment.

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Don
.
[1]


David was described as "A sometimes grumpy man between the age of 50 and 70 years old who has a granddaughter."


He is one of the few people to have died of natural causes.
[2]


It is possible that David served in the military alongside Bill Jenkins as he refers to him as his "war buddy" and a photo of them can be seen in uniform in Bill's apartment.


He is the only person the Governor shows remorse for after killing.


David is one of five known cancer patients in the TV Series, with 
Michael Coleman
, 
Molly
, 
Lucille Smith
, and 
Ezekiel Sutton
 being the other four.


A Gorbelli store is seen in 
The Walking Dead: Onslaught
, which is the company that David worked for.


David is one of the two most used names in the 
TV Series
 with it being used four times, tied with 
Michael
. This character is the second character introduced to be named David.
