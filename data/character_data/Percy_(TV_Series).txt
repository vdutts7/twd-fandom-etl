Overview
[
]


Percy is a kind-hearted old man. Despite barely even knowing 
Beth
, he is willing to help her distract the cops by pretending to be sick. Percy often gets pushed around by the corrupt cops at the hospital, such as 
O'Donnell
 and is unable to defend himself.

Crossed
"
[

Percy is seen standing outside his room, participating in a plan that he and 
Beth Greene
 made to create a distraction. After he receives some strawberries from Beth, he fakes a sudden and severe coughing fit. As Beth sneaks off to the hospital's medicine cabinet to retrieve some epinephrine for 
Carol Peletier
, a new patient at the hospital who happens to have been part of Beth's previous group, Percy continues to cough, distracting Officers 
Alvarado
 and 
Tanaka
. When Beth walks by, as a sign of mission complete, Percy stops coughing and alerts the officers that he is fine.



"
Coda
"
[
]


Percy is harassed by Officer 
O'Donnell
 but is saved from harm after 
Dawn Lerner
 tells O'Donnell to back off. After the deaths of Beth and Dawn during the unsuccessful hostage exchange, 
Rick Grimes
 lets the patients know that they can leave the hospital with his group if they wish. However, Percy, Dr. 
Steven Edwards
, and the other patients choose to stay.
