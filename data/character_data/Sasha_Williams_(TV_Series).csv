,,,"Sasha is a fierce, pragmatic and scarred woman who's a dead-eye with a gun. She is extremely practical and always leans towards the most logical decision, though beneath her rough exterior lies compassion and loyalty for her friends. Due to trauma post-apocalypse, Sasha has become extremely hardened and detached. Along with her brother, Sasha has strong morals, but often questions the safety of other survivalist groups and communities. This is shown when Carl locks she and her fellow survivors into a cell-block after they arrive at the prison, to which she panics and yells at Carl, being unaware of the nature of Carl's group, ensuring their situation is not precarious. Later, when she arrives at Woodbury, she begins to question The Governor and soon on the journey to Terminus with Maggie Rhee and Bob Stookey , as she strongly suspects their destination to be false hope, which proves to be true. She has shown leadership qualities, having been the co-leader one of the prominent supply runners for the prison, along with Daryl Dixon . Being one of the most well-known at the prison, Sasha became one of the council members, showing that she was trusted by the other members of the Survivors. Bob asks for her permission to come along and she is shown to be giving everyone else orders. Tyreese jokingly asks ""Was there ever a time you weren't the boss of me?"" On the road with Maggie and Bob, she insists they follow her lead and find a place to live by themselves, proposing a more practical approach to survival. Sasha appears to be a realist. Sasha's practicality and cynicism often clashes with the optimism of Bob and Tyreese. Bob attempts to get her to open up to people and see a broader outlook on life beyond simply surviving, and the two become a couple. After the deaths of Bob and Tyreese in a short period of time, Sasha flounders with PTSD and depression. It exacerbates when she spends time in the civil community of Alexandria, largely unaffected by the brutality of the apocalyptic world outside. Examples include her shooting the photo frames of dead families as target practice, stemming from an explosive rage of jealousy that they have not lived the horrors of the world as she has. Her alertness at the party, trying to pay attention to so much but not being able to keep track conversations and exploding at a woman who speaks of trivial matters such as her favorite meal, also highlight this. She later hunts walkers as a way of lashing out her rage over the deaths. Eventually, Sasha finds solace with Maggie's support and accepting her losses. She makes the decision that she wants to live and move on. Moving past the worst of her grief, she contributes in Rick's quarry plan on patrols with Abraham Ford . Despite her previous hostility towards him, the two form a bond and she empathizes with his own severe struggles of PTSD. She expresses concern of his actions, and says that she can see his struggles but he must acknowledge the extent of how much weight they carry with a community of people to be accountable for, and for there to be a bigger picture to live a fulfilled life, in some way. Abraham agrees and hopes for a long and fruitful life. He begins to flirt with her, and compliments her no-nonsense attitude. While she accepts his compliments, she is conscious of the fact he is still in a relationship. After several months, the two continue bonding but Sasha has decided to stop going on patrols and gives Eugene her shift so she can distance herself (aware that Abraham and Rosita are together). Abraham then breaks up with Rosita. Later, after Denise dies and Abraham and the others face another life-threatening situation, he approaches her and reminds her of what she said to him about choices, and the idea of not knowing if tomorrow will be their last day, and ""thirty years"" still not being enough. He tells her she has choices too, and she asks him to come inside, as they begin a relationship together.","Sasha and her older brother, Tyreese , both lived somewhere in Jacksonville, Florida, before the outbreak began. She was raised by her disciplined father, a war veteran. They had a neighbor called Jerry. As children, Sasha used to follow Tyreese around and copy everything he did. When she grew up, Sasha was employed as a firefighter.","During the outbreak's onset, she and her older brother, Tyreese , stayed at a bunker in their neighbor Jerry's backyard for about 7 months, until they ran out of supplies. After that, they met up with survivors Allen , Donna , and Ben and joined a larger group, which had about 25 survivors at one point. The camp was eventually overrun, and many were killed. For about 6 weeks they wandered until they arrived at the West Georgia Correctional Facility . Sasha makes her debut appearance in this episode. She, along with the rest of her group, discover a collapsed part of the wall at the back of the prison. She debates on whether or not it's a good idea to enter. She ends up following the group's leader, and her brother, Tyreese, into a broken down part of the fence leading into the prison. While they hold up in the boiler room, they are attacked by numerous walkers. In the middle of the battle against the dead, a young boy, Carl Grimes , appears and saves them. Despite the confusion, Carl guides everyone back to the cell block. Sasha is first seen in the prison's common room, where she is talking with Beth Greene about Judith . Later, she and Tyreese tell the group about how they managed to survive through the past months. She is then seen assisting Tyreese, Allen, and Ben with taking Donna's body outside to bury her. When Allen comes up with the idea of taking over the prison, Sasha and Tyreese manage to get him and Ben to give up the plan, saying that ""they're good people."" At the end of the day, Tyreese's group returns to the kitchen, attempting to convince Rick Grimes into allowing them stay, saying that they'll ""help with anything,"" and Sasha explains that they won't make it on their own, saying that it's like ""Ten Little Indians"" outside. When Rick begins hallucinating of his recently-deceased wife and yelling at "" Lori "" to get out, Sasha and the rest of them leave the prison (believing Rick was yelling at them). Sasha and her group run into Andrea during her return to the prison. Milton and Andrea tell them about Woodbury , and Milton offers to take them there. She and the group arrive in Woodbury, and mention the prison during a conversation with The Governor . Tyreese says he can provide some details about the layout of the prison. Throughout this discussion, she is continuously stared at by The Governor. Sasha and Tyreese are seen guarding the wall and Sasha makes fun of how poor a shot Tyreese is when Andrea comes and tries to lure them away to another part of the wall. When they refuse, Andrea confesses that she's leaving Woodbury and they should too. She warns them about The Governor before fleeing. Sasha is later seen at the walker pit and witnesses the fight between Allen and Tyreese. She tries intervening to save Allen when Tyreese holds him over the pit. Sasha is seen with Tyreese and the rest of the Woodbury residents, as they prepare to move out to attack the prison, when her brother announces to the Governor that he and Sasha are not going with them, because they ""don't kill people, just walkers"", saying they are staying to protect the children, and if he wants to, they leave when he comes back. The Governor then gives Tyreese a rifle and coldly thanks them, leaving Sasha scared with his reaction. When Rick, Daryl Dixon , Michonne Hawthorne and Karen reach Woodbury, Sasha and Tyreese are told that the Governor went mad and killed all Woodbury soldiers who wanted to retreat. Later, Sasha and Tyreese are taken, along with the remaining Woodbury survivors, to the prison, where they join the group. Sasha is seen readying a vehicle with Tyreese to go on a supply run to Big Spot . Newcomer Bob Stookey asks her if he can go. She is initially reluctant to let him come along, saying he has only been with them a week. ""You were out on your own when Daryl found you. I just want to make sure you know how to play on a team,"" she tells him, but ultimately decides to let him come. At Big Spot, Sasha lays out the group's plan to get in and get out. Things go awry when Bob accidentally breaks a shelf, which lands on him. Walkers suddenly begin falling in from holes in the ceiling. Sasha is seen fighting with a pool cue alongside Michonne. Zach is bitten by one while saving Bob. A helicopter makes the roof cave in, crushing Zach and the walkers while Sasha and the others escape. She is first seen with the other ""council"" members discussing the situation at the prison and how to deal with it before she and Karen persuade Tyreese that its best to put Karen in isolation. Later she is seen helping the others deal with the walkers at the fences and is the one to spot the rat corpses suggesting that someone is feeding the walkers. Sasha is seen exiting one of the cell blocks, coughing heavily, and running a fever. Glenn Rhee and Hershel look at her with great concern. She states that she needs to find Dr. S and that she will be all right. She goes to look for him in Cell Block A where the sick people are staying, but when she find him she discovers that he is also sick. She is quarantined behind a glass barrier, which is guarded by Tyreese. They are later seen talking and she expresses her condolences for Karen. Tyreese tells her that a group went out looking for antibiotics for the sick, which he later joins to make sure she recovers. Tyreese asks Carol to look after Sasha while he is gone. Sasha gets worse as the episode goes on. Hershel tells her to take over the incubator attached to Henry , who is in the final stage of the deadly flu, while he goes to help other patients. Sasha leaves her post later for Glenn to take over. Henry later succumbs and turns. Sasha later becomes dehydrated, so Hershel performs I.V. treatment to her and she is revived. Sasha then tells Hershel that she always calculated everything to live as long as possible and is thankful for his ""stupid"" behavior, (Hershel risking getting sick to save the flu infected survivors). At the end of the episode Sasha is cradled by the recently arrived Tyreese. It is not shown, but it is inferred that she was given the injection to stop the flu. Sasha's condition has improved. However she still hasn't made a full recovery, as she nearly faints while speaking to Bob. She tries to thank him, to his disapproval, because she does not know of his actions during the run. She is later seen with Bob and Maggie shooting at The Governor's men. Bob is shot and the trio is left behind as the bus drives away. Sasha doesn't seem too worried and says they'll figure it out. Sasha is seen on a river bank in the forest with Maggie, bandaging Bob's shoulder. She objects to Maggie's plan of going to look for Glenn and the prison bus, but after Bob decides to go with Maggie, she follows. They later find the bus, now filled with the undead prison occupants, which they proceed to clear out. Sasha is with Bob and Maggie fighting off walkers in fog. Sasha sees that Bob has been attacked by a walker on his arm and shows deep sorrow, believing he has been bitten. Bob reveals the walker got him on his bandage and the three cheer in relief. Sasha disagrees with Bob and Maggie about going to Terminus , citing practical reasons for survival and questioning the stability of the place, and whether it is truly a safe haven. She tries to convince Bob to find a safe place to stay but he still wants to go to Terminus with Maggie. Bob believes Sasha is simply afraid to take a leap of faith to find out whether Tyreese is dead or not. Sasha tries to insist she is not afraid. When Bob and Sasha find out Maggie left for Terminus they go after her. Sasha finds a safe building and she tries to convince Bob to come with her, but Bob kisses her and goes after Maggie. Sasha, now alone, begins to cry but then looks out of the building window and sees Maggie. Sasha and Maggie fight off walkers. Maggie convinces Sasha that they can get to Terminus and she knows Sasha is afraid of the dangers, but makes her aware of what she is risking it for. Sasha admits she is afraid, then agrees to come, much to Maggie's happiness. The two then go after Bob and the three reunite to go to Terminus. Glenn and Abraham Ford 's group continue along the tracks, uncovering more bloody messages from Maggie, Bob and Sasha. After Glenn and Abraham's groups part ways at a mountainside railway tunnel, Sasha and her group later meet with Abraham, Rosita Espinosa and Eugene Porter on the other side. The six return to the railway tunnel that Glenn and Tara entered in pursuit of Maggie and save the two from advancing walkers. The group decides to settle down in the tunnel that night and Sasha learns of Abraham's mission and Eugene's claims. She agrees to go on with the group to Washington, but only after arriving at Terminus to see if Tyreese has made it. Bob agrees with her, on both counts. The following day, Sasha and the rest of the group arrive on foot at Terminus. After easily entering the compound's perimeter, the group eventually come upon a middle aged woman, Mary , cooking in a courtyard. The woman smiles and introduces herself, telling them she'll get them settled before offering them a plate of food. Sasha appears in the train car at Terminus when Rick, Carl, Michonne and Daryl enter. Sasha helps prepare weapons to attack the Terminus guards. When Eugene starts talking about protecting himself so he can cure the virus, Sasha questions him, causing Eugene to reveal his intentions to the group. As Terminus is under attack, Sasha escapes with the other survivors. In the woods, Sasha shares an emotional reunion with Tyreese and happily walks alongside him as the survivors make their journey away from Terminus. Sasha is seen playing a game with Bob called 'good out of the bad'. After a few rounds they kiss. Sasha is present when the group find Gabriel and he leads them to his church . Sasha goes with Bob, Rick, Michonne and Gabriel to the local food bank to look for supplies. When they discover the floor has fallen through, Sasha creates a plan to use the shelves to block them away from the walkers to take them out more easily. When Bob is dragged under the water by a walker, Sasha rushes to help him. Later in the church, Sasha and Bob are sat together during Abrahams speech. After the speech she leaves to go hold Judith, giving Bob one last kiss before he leaves the church. Sasha is first seen wandering in the woods, looking for Bob after he goes missing. Rick and Tyreese bring her back inside. Sasha assumes Bob, Carol and Daryl's disappearances are connected to Gabriel, so angrily confronts him with a knife. She listens as Gabriel breaks down and admits his sins. After Bob is dumped outside, she rushes to him, enlisting Tara and others to carry him inside. She is shocked by what has happened to his leg and offers him medicine, but he refuses and reveals his bite. Sasha stays by Bob's side when he is moved into Gabriel's office. When Rick, Maggie, Glenn, Abraham, Tara and Michonne plan to leave the church and kill the cannibals Sasha volunteers to go with them. Tyreese tries to persuade her to stay with Bob for when he wakes up but she refuses. When they ambush the cannibals, Sasha kills Martin by stabbing him repeatedly in the chest. Sasha is present as everyone says their goodbyes to Bob, holding his hand before leaving him alone with Rick and Judith. Sasha is then with Bob when he wakes up from a dream about her. Sasha gives Bob one last smile and asks him ""What's the good that comes out of this bad?"". Bob then dies and Sasha starts crying, readying her knife to stop him reanimating. Tyreese then walks in and takes the knife from her, not letting her go through this. Sasha is then seen wearing Bob's jacket over his grave, making a makeshift gravestone from twigs and rope. Sasha stays at the church to help find Carol and Daryl, instead of going ahead to Washington with Abraham and his group. Sasha is severely troubled by Bob's loss and opens the episode by hacking apart a pew in Father Gabriel's church, while Tyreese comments to Daryl about how hard losing him was. Sasha is wearing Bob's green military jacket while she helps fortify the church. In the truck, on the way to the hospital in Atlanta, she refuses Tyreese's attempts at consoling her, but later on when she tears Bob's jacket while unloading equipment, she accepts his help. There is a moment when Officer Lamson first says his name is ""Bob,"" and we can tell that might be very meaningful to Sasha. She guards him and gets to know him while they wait for the plan to come to fruition. Bob Lamson tells her about a friend of his that he was replaced with that took the last load of survivors to the evacuation center, and that he recognized his animated corpse, fused with the blacktop on the way into the area. He asks Sasha to take care of him, and she asks where the zombie is. They go together about to the other side of the factory floor and he tells her where his friend is. When she lines up the shot, though, he slams into her, knocking her unconscious on the window, and runs out the door, with his hands still bound. Sasha survives the attack by Lamson and is seen on the roof-top with Tyreese as they watch over Rick, who is making himself known to the police officers at the hospital. Tyreese confesses to Sasha that he previously had the chance to kill Martin, the Hunter Sasha murdered, but didn't. Tyreese then asks what happened to them and wonders if they're still the same as they were as kids. Sasha dismisses this and tells him that he is still the same, which is a good thing, but she can't be anymore. The two then proceed to watch over Rick. Sasha shoots an incoming walker, revealing to the officers that Rick has people covering him. Sasha later accompanies Rick and the others as they meet with Dawn Lerner to exchange prisoners. It goes smoothly, and Carol and Beth are returned safely, but Dawn insists that Noah return to the hospital. Her insistence results in tension, but Noah agrees to prevent further bloodshed. Dawn makes a snide remark to Noah, which angers Beth, who attacks her with a pair of scissors. Dawn reacts instinctively and shoots Beth in the head, killing her instantly. Sasha and the others witness this in shock and horror. Daryl, enraged, shoots Dawn in the head, killing her as well. Officer Shepherd defuses the situation and tells them that Dawn was always the problem. The group are invited to stay at the hospital, but Rick refuses and in return demands that anybody who wants to leave the hospital be allowed to do so with him. Only Noah agrees to leave. The group depart the hospital just as Maggie, Abraham, Glenn, Michonne and the others arrive. Sasha watches on in helplessness as Maggie sobs hysterically at the sight of Beth's body, which is being carried out of the hospital by a devastated Daryl. Sasha is seen towards the end of the episode. After Tyreese is bitten, has his arm amputated and dies, she is seen near the end of the episode at his funeral, receiving a shovel by Daryl to finish burying her brother, Tyreese. However, due to her catatonia, she is unable to bury him and staggers away from his grave in despair. Sasha is first seen looking for water in the forest, finding a dried up stream containing several dead frogs. She then reunites with Maggie and Daryl before rejoining the whole group. She then talks to Michonne as the group are walking, talking about how she could take on the walkers following them and how she is not like her brother. When the group plans to take out the walkers behind them by pushing them off a cliff, Sasha joins in the effort. But she decides to not follow the plan and begins stabbing walkers instead, extremely angry whilst doing it. In her rage she almost stabs Michonne and cuts Abraham on his upper arm. Michonne then pushes her to the ground to stop her. Whilst walking, Abraham offers Sasha some alcohol he found but she refuses. Sasha is next seen killing four dogs when they were about to attack the group on the road. After collecting firewood, she tells Noah that if he doesn't think he will make it he wont. When water is mysteriously left for them and it begins to rain, she is one of the only people not to seem happy about it, along with Daryl and Maggie. The group then find a barn to shelter in from a storm, where Sasha sits alone in the corner. When a herd attacks the barn, Sasha is the third to get up and try to hold the door, after Maggie and Daryl. The group is just barely saved by a timely tornado that wrecked the herd of walkers. The next morning, Daryl and Maggie discuss Sasha's brother before Maggie wakes her up and takes her outside. The storm had destroyed the woods nearby, impaling and crushing walkers. The two girls head to a field and sit on a log, watching the sunrise. Sasha explains that she doesn't think she can survive, but Maggie persuades her she can. Her and Maggie are then approached by a stranger asking for Rick, when the music box starts playing. Sasha brings Aaron into the barn, carrying his backpack and vouching for him being safe. She rides on the RV for both legs of the journey to the Alexandria Safe Zone at night. She remains silent during Rick's argument with Aaron regarding where he could be sleeping. The following morning, she gets out of the RV and enters Alexandria. Sasha appears throughout the episode, first killing a walker just outside the gate. She is one of the only people not to be assigned a job by the end of the episode, along with Daryl. Sasha goes outside the wall and shoots framed photographs as target practice. When she returns, she asks the leader, Deanna Monroe , if she could be lookout and volunteers to take as many shifts as possible. Deanna picks up on that and asks why she wants to be lookout so desperately, but Sasha is interrupted by Rick. Deanna says she'll think about it if she comes to a welcome party for her and the other new arrivals. However, the atmosphere makes her uncomfortable as the guests worry about little matters such as pasta makers and begins reliving experiences with Tyreese, Bob and Beth and their subsequent deaths before out-bursting at an Alexandria resident and storming off. The next day as she stands near the gate she tells Deanna that Alexandria ""isn't real."" Deanna disagrees with her before handing Sasha a box of ammunition and lets her out the gate. Sasha is seen at night in the tower, taking out a walker which is heading towards Alexandria. The next day she is no where to be found, hence Michonne and Rosita going to look for her. She has been hunting walkers in the woods all day when they find her. Walkers attack and the three women fight them off. When Sasha runs out of ammo in her clip, she uses her knife. A walker tackles her to the ground and she loses her knife. Whilst reaching for it, Michonne takes it out with her gun. She smacks away Michonne's hand when offered a hand up. She breaks down and tells them they can't help her and feels guilty for Noah's death. Later during Rick's fight with Pete, she is back in the tower, sniping walkers again. Sasha is first seen carting walkers individually into a mass grave alone, outside Alexandria. She then lies in the grave in silence, overcome with mixed emotions. Sasha is later seen sitting quietly in Alexandria's chapel, when Gabriel walks in. She asks him if he can help her rid her wild emotions, to which he replies ""No"". Gabriel accuses her of killing even when she had no reason to or it wasn't in self-defense, and aggressively throws guilt on her shoulders. Not wanting to believe this, she shouts repetitively, ""STOP! STOP!"", before the two have a brief fight. Sasha ultimately wins this fight and points her weapon at Gabriel, who is lying on the floor with Sasha keeping him down with her foot. Maggie walks in and defuses this situation, and the three of them are later seen in a circle in the chapel, praying. In the flashbacks after the prayer circle, a level headed Sasha, on her way home, spots a drunken Abraham. Abraham gestures a friendly peace sign which she returns before walking on. In a meeting held by Rick on handling the zombies in the quarry, she volunteers to help Daryl who she knows will need assistance, and Abraham then volunteers to go with her. Sasha is later seen on a road with the Survivors. Abraham approaches her and asks her if she is doing it because she wants to die, and Sasha smiles, saying, ""No"". In the present, Sasha is seen with Rick and his entire group at the quarry. When the truck holding one of the exits closed begins to fall, Rick announces to everyone to get into their positions as the plan is now in place. Sasha and Abraham both get into a red car and begin to drive off and help Daryl lure the walkers away from the quarry. In the car Abraham asks Sasha if she is okay, and she reiterates that she is, and she's ""trying"". Responding to her previous comment earlier, she says that ""doing something as big as this [is] living"". They arrive at the wall and with the help of Daryl, they slowly begin to lure the walkers away onto the road. Abraham, who notices that some of the walkers are leaving the herd, gets out of the car and begins to kill a few of the stragglers, much to Sasha's protesting. He gets back into the car smiling and Sasha questions why he would do something so reckless. Abraham then goes on to describe the deaths of Reg and Pete Anderson in gruesome detail. Sasha then acknowledges Abraham's erratic behavior and his death wish. Both then hear the loud horn coming from the safezone but they still try and attempt to lure the herd away. Still leading the herd of walkers away in their vehicles, Sasha, Abraham, and Daryl all discuss plans to get the herd away from Alexandria without any casualties. Sasha says that the herd could stop them if Daryl goes ahead as he suggested. As Daryl speeds off, Sasha and Abraham yell for him not to go ahead. Later, Sasha listens as Rick alters the plan. He tells Daryl to go back to Sasha and Abraham. At the end of the episode, Sasha and Abraham meet Daryl on the road in their vehicles, continuing to deter the herd away from Alexandria. Sasha first appears in the car with Abraham riding alongside Daryl. The group of 3 have successfully lured nearly half of the quarry zombies 20 miles away from Alexandria. Just when Sasha and Abraham begin to drive back to Alexandria, they are opened fire upon by an unknown group of survivors. Sasha and Abraham both drive away to which they get separated from Daryl. Sasha crashes the car into the woods to fool her attackers. Just then Sasha and Abraham both emerge from the woods and proceed to shoot the two attackers in their car. Abraham prepares to go after the other attackers but Sasha stops him saying there could be more of them. Sasha and Abraham both head to a nearby town where they spot a lone zombie, Abraham states he wants to go after the zombie but Sasha stops him again and says that they don't want to leave a trail for the attackers to follow. Abraham and Sasha head into a nearby building before Sasha writes ""Dixon"" on the door in an attempt for Daryl to find them. Sasha and Abraham both rest in the house to which Abraham notices a walker behind a glass wall to which he wants to kill. Sasha then goes on to talk to Abraham about his behavior and his killer instinct and that he can change and not have to be so reckless to which he understands. Sasha offers to stay on watch for the night but Abraham says he will so she can sleep. Abraham later comes back to the house the next morning in an army dress suit with a RPG, cigars and a case filled with Rockets. Sasha is shocked and amazed at Abraham's discovery and she complements him for his find. Abraham then tells Sasha that he likes her and wants to get to know her better. Sasha accepts with reminding Abraham to focus on the situation at hand. Sasha notices an oil fuel truck outside the house and smiles when she sees Daryl. Sasha is present with Abraham and Daryl driving back to Alexandria when they hear a voice on their radio calling for help. Sasha is seen in a post-credits scene with Abraham and Daryl. Their truck is stopped by a gang on motorcycles. They tell them to get out the truck and hand over everything they have, because it now belongs to Negan . As Sasha, Abraham and Daryl are driving back to Alexandria in the fuel truck, they are stopped by a group of armed men on motorcycles. The leader of the gang informs the trio that their guns and truck now belong to a man named Negan before taking their sidearms. He orders one of the men to take Daryl to the back of the truck and inspect its cargo while Sasha and Abraham stay behind. After some conversation between Abraham, Sasha and the leader of the gang, as the latter is threatening to shoot them, the whole group of bikers explodes. Daryl then comes out from behind the truck holding an RPG, having subdued and killed the biker who went to check cargo with him, and leaves with Abraham and Sasha Later Sasha and Abraham suddenly appear. Standing on top of the fuel truck, they're able to gun down the walkers and save Glenn. Sasha then helps the Alexandrians and Rick fight the mega walker herd, eventually succeeding. Sasha is then resting outside of Denise's infirmary after the bloody battle. Two months have passed. Sasha continues bonding with Abraham. As Abraham tells her that he will see her tomorrow after they finish a run together, she tells him that she has changed from patrols back to guard duty again, and has given her job with Abraham to Eugene, who Sasha says wants to help out more. Abraham seems slightly saddened by this, but she offers another friendly peace sign gesture, which he returns and walks on. Briefly later, Abraham is in bed with Rosita and is thinking about Sasha, suggesting his romantic feelings towards her. Sasha speaks to Rick and Michonne, asking if they have food, to which Michonne disappointingly responds that they do, for another month. At the meeting, Rick proposes the idea of an attack on the Saviors , the group of people who tried to kill her, Daryl and Abraham on the road. She agrees to go with the others to their main base. Inside the main base, Sasha works on breaking into a door after scoping the area. She is with Abraham, who has since broken up with Rosita. One of the Saviors opens a door behind Abraham and sees them and instantly slashes at Abraham. The man lunges at Abraham but he pushes him off in Sasha's direction. Sasha stabs him repeatedly, but before he falls to his death, he reaches for the alarm and it goes off. Then, the group openly engage in combat against the alerted Saviors, killing about 20 of them overall. Sasha shoots one in the abdomen and leaves by morning with the others. Sasha is seen keeping watch and nods at Eugene daily when he arrives to take his shift. Later on, Abraham approaches her on her porch and reminds her of what she said to him about him having choices, and says that she has them too. She then invites him inside. Sasha then watches Rosita cover Eugene's shift due to his injury. Sasha and Abraham continue bonding, as she climbs down the ladder from the guard post to give him a cigar. Rosita watches on, acknowledging the attraction between the two. Later, Rick panics when he learns Carol has left the community on her own, exiling herself. Sasha tells Rick that she did not see anyone through her 12 to 6am shift, and nobody else did. He then goes out to find Carol, but tells Sasha and the others to stay back in the community. Sasha remains with Rick throughout much of this episode in the RV and takes care of Maggie, who had come down with a sickness. When the RV is stopped on the road, Sasha goes with the others out of the vehicle to display their weapons to the Saviors ordering them to surrender. She gets back into the RV upon Rick's refusal to surrender. She consults the map to determine the fastest route to the Hilltop. Later on, Abraham and she occupy the front of the vehicle. Abraham asks her if she believes that Maggie had made the right decision in deciding to become pregnant. She replies that she does not think she would make her choice and she is unsure if she is ready to have children. Abraham jokingly tells her that he is ready to have kids immediately. Sasha moves closer to him and kisses him, much to Abraham's delight. Before she can do anything further, the RV is blocked once again by a group of Saviors. After leaving again and being stopped again, the RV comes to a rest in front of a chained up group of walkers. Sasha and Eugene recognize a few articles on the walkers' bodies as belongings of Michonne and Daryl. When they are shot at from atop a hill, Abraham covers them while she and Rick dispatch the walkers in their way. Eugene volunteers to drive the RV alone while the others go on foot in the dark to try and sneak their way to the hilltop. When the Saviors announce their presence via a round of whistling, Rick calls for them all to run. Sasha lets the others carry Maggie while Sasha runs with her pistol drawn. She quietly surrenders when over seventy Saviors surround them, reveal the second captive group of the Saviors and she watches in horror as Negan Smith , the leader of the Saviors, decides which of her group to beat to death. Then he selects his victim and brutally kills an Alexandrian. At this point, it is unknown if Sasha is the victim or not. It is revealed that Abraham was selected, and Sasha watches helplessly as he is brutally beaten to death. Sasha, along with the rest of the group, reacts in shock and horror at the deaths of Abraham Ford and Glenn Rhee . When the executions have finished, Sasha is forced to stay behind with the remaining survivors until daybreak while Negan takes Rick away in the RV to an unknown location. Sasha watches on helplessly as Negan returns with Rick who then threatens her life if Rick does not obey Negan's command to amputate Carl's left arm. After Negan is satisfied, he stops Rick from performing the amputation believing he has become submissive and thus spares Sasha's life along with the others who were also threatened. When the Saviors leave, Sasha volunteers to assist a mourning Maggie in getting to the Hilltop to seek her appropriate medical needs. Sasha then approaches a distraught Rosita and the two lament over Abraham's corpse along with Eugene who is also devastated by the loss. Sasha waits for Maggie outside Dr. Carson’s trailer. She comes outside and asks where Glenn and Abraham are buried. At the graves, Sasha gives Maggie Glenn's pocket watch. She places it on Glenn's grave as a marker. Sasha tells her she could only find a cigar for Abraham. Sasha offers to stay at The Hilltop with Maggie. Jesus approaches, and places flowers on the graves. Gregory arrives and demands to know why Maggie's people didn't wipe out all The Saviors, and whether they know about his deal with Rick. He tells Sasha and Maggie to burn Glenn and Abraham's bodies and orders them to leave The Hilltop by morning. Sasha makes her bed in Jesus' trailer, where she and Maggie are staying the night. She asks Jesus to change Gregory's mind and offers to earn Maggie’s keep by scavenging for The Hilltop. Jesus gives her Abraham's brake light necklace. Sasha and Maggie wake up in the middle of the night and see fires blazing outside. Music blares from a parked car. The Hilltop gates are wide open. The trailer's door and windows are locked so they climb out through the sunroof. They see walkers flooding in through the front gate, drawn by the music. Sasha and Jesus kill walkers. Sasha tries to stop the music but finds the car sealed off with metal grates. She sees a metal hand with an extended middle finger attached to the back of the car – she realizes the Saviors are behind the attack. The next day, Gregory thanks Sasha and Maggie for saving The Hilltop but still refuses to let them stay. He slyly offers to work something out with Sasha one-on-one. They're interrupted by the sound of Saviors in the courtyard. Gregory tells Jesus to hide Sasha and Maggie in the foyet closet, but he hides them in Gregory's bedroom. As the Saviors leave, Jesus tells Maggie and Sasha that initially, he couldn't imagine anyone but Gregory running The Hilltop. ""I can now,"" he says cryptically. Maggie leaves. Sasha asks Jesus to find out where Negan lives, but to keep it a secret from Maggie. Jesus agrees to follow the truck that's heading back to The Saviors' compound. Sasha joins Maggie and Enid in Jesus' trailer. They sit around the table, take each other's hands and pray. Later, Sasha sharpens her knife while Abraham's cigar hangs from her mouth. Sasha arrives at the trailer with an apple pie. She tells Maggie that a resident's daughter thinks Maggie should run for president of Hilltop. Maggie asks if Jesus is still around as she wants him to pick up school supplies for the children. Sasha reveals he left for a supply run that morning. Maggie leaves to get milk, and Enid calls Sasha out for lying to Maggie. She guesses that she's trying to kill Negan, and tells her she is not the only person that wants to. Sasha urges Enid not to tell Maggie as she would want to help and they need to keep her safe. Sasha reunites with Rick and the others as they arrive at the Hilltop. Rosita gives her a reassuring nod, which she returns before giving Michonne a hug. Together, they all stride towards the mansion. Sasha is present when Rick tries to convince Gregory to fight against the Saviors. Jesus then tells the group it's time they met King Ezekiel. Sasha accompanies the group to the Kingdom, where they are reunited with Morgan and meet Ezekiel. After Ezekiel refuses to fight, Sasha vents to Rosita that she knew he would say no but it still pissed her off. Rosita blows her off and tells her that just because they slept with the same guy, it doesn't make them friends. On their way back from the Kingdom, they encounter a blockade of cars on the highway set up by the Saviors. Sasha helps to dismantle the explosives as a herd begins to approach. Rick asks if she and Jesus can make it back to the Hilltop on foot, and they head back. Sasha is kneeling by Abraham's grave when Rosita arrives. She asks for her help to kill Negan. Sasha agrees to help on one condition - she gets to take the shot. Rosita agrees and hands Sasha a rifle. She tells her she memorized Daryl and Carl's description of Negan's compound. Sasha says Jesus drew her a map of the compound’s exterior. Sasha says she is ready to kill him and they acknowledge that the mission will likely end in their deaths. Rosita emphasizes, ""It's a one way ticket for both of us. If it is both of us."" Sasha agrees. Sasha sharpens a blade and draws floor plans of the Sanctuary. Sasha trains the Hilltop residents with knives. Later on in the trailer, Jesus hands her a map of the Sanctuary. Sasha is sitting by Abraham’s grave when Rosita arrives and tells her she needs her help. Sasha takes some bullets hidden in a book but is caught by Jesus and Enid. He begs Sasha to delay her mission until more people can join her, but she refuses. Sasha hands Enid a bracelet for Maggie's baby and tells her to work on it while she's gone. Enid warns Sasha that she's going to tell Maggie what's going on, but she'll give Sasha a ten-minute head start. Sasha packs her bag and she and Rosita leave the Hilltop through a secret escape hatch. They escape through the woods on foot. Rosita tries to hotwire a car, to no avail. She notices Sasha's necklace and gruffly points out that she made it for Abraham. As the two continue looking for a ride, Rosita rebuffs Sasha's attempts to make small talk. Sasha suggests they hole up in a building near the Sanctuary and shoot Negan from a distance. She's sure she won't miss. Rosita argues that they should enter the compound and kill Negan on-site to ensure success. At an abandoned car lot, Sasha and Rosita climb the fence and Rosita hotwires a car. They drive off to the Sanctuary. Sasha and Rosita situate themselves in an empty building near the Sanctuary. Sasha observes the walker yard through her rifle's scope and sees Eugene monitoring the area, and giving orders. She relays the information to Rosita, who is convinced Eugene must be playing some angle. As they wait for Negan to emerge, Rosita opens up to Sasha, revealing she learned everything she knows about bombs, cars, knots etc from men she dated. They wanted to protect her but she always ended up surpassing their skills. Sasha asks if it was the same with Abraham. Rosita says Abraham saw her as she was. Rosita admits that she wasted her time hating Sasha and wishes she could've gotten the chance to tell Abraham she was happy for him. She asks Sasha if she was happy, and she says she was. She says Negan denied Abraham the chance to go out fighting, to make a point. She says that's what they all want and that no matter what happens, she has Rosita's back. Rosita agrees. Sasha looks through the rifle's scope again and sees the truck arrive with Harlan Carson . Negan finally walks into the courtyard Sasha is unable to get a clear shot. They hear Eugene on their walkie, ordering Saviors to help beef up fence security. There's a change in plans as Sasha and Rosita decide to enter the compound. That night, Sasha and Rosita kill a Savior accompanying Eugene in the courtyard and attempt to break him free. Eugene refuses and goes back inside. Sasha tells Rosita to keep watch as she slips through the fence. She closes the opening behind her at the last minute, locking Rosita out. Despite Rosita's protests, Sasha tells her it is not her time and that Alexandria still needs her. Sasha smiles before running towards the Sanctuary, gunning down another Savior before she makes it inside. Sasha, having failed to kill Negan off-screen, lies on the ground of Daryl's old cell, her arms and legs bound. A Savior named David visits and she asks for water. David gets uncomfortably close and tears her shirt. Sasha headbutts him, knocking him over. Angered, David unbuckles his pants and tries to rape her. However, Negan intervenes and reminds David that rape is forbidden before stabbing him through the neck, killing him. Sasha assures Negan that Rick did not send her to assassinate him. Negan, impressed by Sasha’s ""lady nuts,"" asks her to join the Saviors. He unties her wrists, gives her his knife and presents his proposition: she can choose not to use the knife, allowing David to reanimate and kill her, or she can save herself and use the knife against David, but she'll have to join Negan's cause. He leaves the cell. Eugene brings Sasha a blanket and pillow. He explains why he joined Negan and recommends she do the same as Abraham would want her to. Sasha glares at him and Eugene admits he wouldn't. Sasha orders him to leave as David starts to reanimate. Negan opens the door to Sasha's cell and sees that Sasha has put down David with the knife. ""You win,"" Sasha says, agreeing to join him. Negan retrieves the knife and says that Sasha needs to further convince him of her loyalty. He tells her that he knows Rick is formulating a plot against him and that he plans to enlist her help in stopping him. Eugene stops by Sasha's cell and assures her she made the right choice. Sasha sobs, convinced that she made the wrong decision. She's worried that she'll be used as a tool against the Survivors. She begs Eugene to bring her a weapon – a knife, gun or razor blade – so she can kill herself before Negan uses her against their friends. He agrees to consider her request. In the cell, Sasha's face shows resolve as she plays her angle. Eugene knocks on Sasha's cell door and slips her the suicide pill that he made for Frankie and Tanya . Sasha despairs when she realizes he didn't bring her a weapon she can use against Negan. In a dark, enclosed space, Sasha struggles to maintain consciousness. Music echoes from her earbuds as she finally drifts off. In a flashback, Sasha sleeps on a couch. Abraham wakes her and tells her that Maggie needs medical attention, and he's accompanying the Survivors on their trip to Hilltop to get her to a doctor. Sasha asks him to stay behind. In the present, Negan brings a tray of food to Sasha's cell. He assures her she doesn't have to die that day but warns that someone from the Survivors does. She asks him what he needs from her. In another flashback, Sasha sits next to Maggie in a field. Sasha continues listening to music through her earbuds. Continuing the same flashback from earlier, Sasha tells Abraham that she had a dream in which he died. In the present, Negan tells Sasha how he plans to use her in his attack against Alexandria. He insists on executing three people, but Sasha bargains him down to one. In the flashback, Sasha and Maggie continue to stare out at the field. Sasha listens to music on her headphones. She struggles to keep her eyes open. In the flashback, Sasha tells Abraham about her dream. They were at the beach, he went under water and never resurfaced. Abraham jokes that he hates the beach and gets up to leave for the Hilltop. Sasha again asks for them to sit this one out -- ""Maggie's got to take care of Maggie,"" she says. As Sasha and Eugene prepare to leave for Alexandria, he asks if she has had a change of heart regarding the ""allergy medication"". She says she has and he assures her she'll get used to life at the Sanctuary. ""No, not like you,"" she says. In the flashback, Sasha and Maggie watch the sunrise. Sasha listens to music on her headphones. In the flashback, she and Abraham kiss. He reminds her that putting their lives on the line for others is what they do and that Maggie and her baby are the future. Sasha agrees, admitting guilt for her previous statement about Maggie. They leave for their doomed journey to the Hilltop. As Negan's group mobilizes to attack Alexandria, Sasha confirms with Eugene that it will take a couple of hours to reach their destination. Eugene gives her an iPod with headphones. Sasha tells Negan that she wants to travel to Alexandria in the casket so she can rest. She requests a bottle of water. Inside the coffin, Sasha selects a song from the iPod. As music begins to play, she pops the suicide pill in her mouth and takes a drink of water. In the present, Negan opens the casket door. Sasha, now a walker, lunges at him and they fall from the truck. The Survivors takes advantage of the ensuing chaos and turns their guns on the Scavengers . As Sasha tries to bite Negan, Roy pulls her off of him and she tears into his face. Later after the battle, Maggie and Jesus track Sasha down in the woods. Jesus pins her down as Maggie tearfully stabs her in the head. Sasha is then later buried in Alexandria's graveyard with those who participated in the battle in attendance. In a flashback, Sasha and Maggie continue to sit in a field, watching the sunrise. They turn to each other and smile. While searching through the Sanctuary for supplies, Eugene Porter finds Sasha's coffin and has a flashback of the undead Sasha emerging from it. Inside the coffin, Eugene finds Sasha's music player with which he attempts to create a makeshift plane to draw the walkers away. However, Eugene's plan is foiled by Dwight . In a hallucination, Rick's back in the hospital and sees a similar door, this time reading, ""Don't Open, Dead Outside."" He walks through it and finds a pile of dead bodies of all his friends, dead and alive. Rick walks among them until he sees Sasha. She tells him none of this is real and it's time for him to wake up. ""When you put all of us together, your family, you're not going to find them because they're not lost. And you're not lost,"" she tells him. Rick wakes up again and is thrown off the horse near the, now abandoned, camp as it runs off. Sasha appears in Michonne's hallucination during the line-up where Michonne chooses who she will kill with Lucille.","Killed By Negan Smith (Indirectly Caused) Eugene Porter (Caused) Herself (Alive, Suicide) Sasha is captured and held hostage by the Saviors after trying to infiltrate the Sanctuary in order to avenge Abraham's death by killing Negan.

Sasha was never originally planned for the TV show . After the actress Sonequa Martin-Green auditioned for the role of Michonne Hawthorne , Glen Mazzara liked her audition so much they created Sasha specifically for Sonequa. On Talking Dead , Sonequa Martin-Green confirmed that Sasha's job before the apocalypse was a firefighter. Sonequa Martin-Green was pregnant during the filming of the fifth season . As the season progresses, Sasha noticeably wears baggier clothing, wearing Bob 's oversized military jacket, a large black t-shirt, Tyreese 's holster and carries a large AR-15. Her clothing remains the same from "" Four Walls and a Roof "" to "" First Time Again "". Within the context of the show, Sasha carrying the items worn by the people she loved and lost was symbolic of her refusing to let go of them, according to Sonequa Martin-Green. As Season 6 commences, Sasha has begun a recovery process and volunteers for the quarry run. Noticeably she changes her outfit for the first time since Bob's death, symbolic of her moving on from her losses. The majority of Sasha's storyline in Season 6 and 7 is based on the character Holly from the Comic Series. As of Sasha's death: None of the Williams family members are alive. None of the members from Tyreese's original group are alive. None of the characters who joined the prison community at the end of Season 3 are alive. None of the survivors of the prison flu are alive. Judith is the only character introduced in Season 3 who is still alive. She is the last character to die in Season 7 , since Maggie killed her while she was a walker . This also makes her the last walker to die in that season. Sasha is the third main character to be killed in a season finale, the first being Andrea Harrison , the second being her Abraham Ford , and the fourth being Rosita Espinosa . Sasha was the only walker in Season 7 to kill a living person. She is also the first (and currently only) main character to kill a living person as a walker. Sasha is the sixth main character to become a walker, the first being Shane Walsh , the second being Merle Dixon , the third being Hershel Greene , the fourth being Deanna Monroe , the fifth being Spencer Monroe , the seventh being Simon , the eighth being Enid , the ninth being Tara Chambler , the tenth being Siddiq , the eleventh being Alpha , the twelfth being Alden , and the thirteenth being Lance Hornsby . Sasha is the second female main character to become a walker, the first being Deanna Monroe, the third being Enid, the fourth being Tara Chambler, and the fifth being Alpha. Sasha is the third original main character in the TV Series to die, the first being Merle Dixon , the second being Beth Greene , the fourth being Simon, the fifth being Enid, and the sixth being Tara Chambler. Sasha is the second main character to commit suicide, the first being Andrea and third being Carl . However, unlike Andrea and Carl, Sasha still had the option of staying alive. The other two committed suicide to prevent reanimation after being bitten, while Sasha killed herself to reanimate as a walker. When asked about how she felt about reprising her role as Sasha for Tales of the Walking Dead , Sonequa Martin-Green said the following: "" I'd love it, I'd loooooove it. I love Sasha. I love The Walking Dead . That was my family before this family (referring to Star Trek: Discovery ). What a blessing, by the way, that I've been able to be in two situations back to back that were so familiar that have such reach. I would love to. That would be so much fun. It would be interesting, I was always interested in backstory. Of course, I am as an actor with every character that I play. But as the years went on as Sasha, I was finding so much joy in developing so much backstory that no one would ever know. That's one of the great things about being an actor in TV, is that you get to build so much life over the years and over the seasons. I remember when I decided that I was a firefighter and then built all those memories for myself. But then that started to become part of the conversation. And it was nice. It was nice to be able to create in the privacy of your own home in your own little bubble and then have that become a part of the public conversation. That was really cool to see. So, yeah, that would be great. "" [1] Sasha appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "" Lockdown "" and "" Outpost 22 "" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins. Sasha appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "" Rest in Peace "". Sasha is one of few characters to appear in every season after her death.",
