Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Betty's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had a husband, 
daughter
, and 
son
.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Season 3
[
]


"
When the Dead Come Knocking
"
[
]


During one of 
Milton
's experiments, he held up a photo of Betty and mentioned her name to an undead Michael Coleman to see if he could remember his previous life after he died and reanimated.



"
Made to Suffer
"
[
]


Betty is among those woken up by the gunshots and explosions throughout town. After Rick's group leaves Woodbury and the fight ended, Betty is summoned to the arena for an announcement. When it is revealed that Merle and his 
brother
 were captured and deemed responsible for the night's attacks, she and the others jeer and demand death for both perpetrators.



"
The Suicide King
"
[
]


Betty continues to jeer as Merle and Daryl are forced to fight each other to the death. When 
Rick
 and 
Maggie
 begin shooting and throwing smoke grenades in the arena, Betty flees the arena along with the other townspeople. The next morning, she and the other townspeople try to leave Woodbury but are not allowed to do so. She then witnesses 
Richard Foster
 be attacked by a walker and killed by the Governor in the street. Shortly after, she listens to Andrea's speech.



"
Welcome to the Tombs
"
[
]


Following the failed 
prison assault
, Betty's fate is unclear. However, she is most likely dead as it is likely she was among the Woodbury soldiers killed during the prison raid or massacred by the Governor out on the road as she was not seen with the remaining Woodburians arriving at the prison.

Trivia
[
]


Betty Coleman was never credited, but Woodbury extra Debi Hett-Kimsey confirmed she portrayed Betty Coleman in the photograph.
[2]


According to Debi Hett-Kimsey, she is not entirely sure of Betty's fate, as many of the Woodbury survivors simply vanished from the show. She was not included in the finale of Season 3. In spite of this, it would be assumed that Betty was included in the 
Woodbury Army
 and is presumed to have died in the massacre.
