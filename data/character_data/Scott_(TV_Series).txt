He then listens as Gabriel encourages his fellow Alexandrians to not be afraid of the Whisperers since they are cowards putting on an act.

Sometime later that day, Scott listens as Echo Post informs Alexandria of an incoming hundred-walker herd and wonders why would the Whisperers send forces to the gates. While starting to draft people for the scout team, Gabriel changes the plan at the last minute and chooses Scott to be part of his team on the recon mission. That night, the scout team finds the two militia at Echo Post murdered and realizes the Whisperers forced them to give false information about the herd so they would leave Alexandria and weaken the inner defense. They immediately rush back to the community. 

On their way back to the town, they ambush Beta escorting a captured Mary and Scott watches as Beta flees into the woods and as Mary tries to convince them she hasn't betrayed Alexandria.
