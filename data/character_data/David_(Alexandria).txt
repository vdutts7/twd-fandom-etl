It was early on.
 Aaron found me. 
I was alone,
 lost everything... everyone. Myself, I-- 
I wasn't crazy.
 
I just gave up on being someone, an actual person.
 Know what I mean? (...) We found Betsy on the way back to the community. She still saw me. After I thought 
I was dead and gone,
 she was my 
first friend.
 Then she was more. 
She made me more. Even better than how I used to be.
 But if I could make it back, I'd want to say 
goodbye.
 Tell her... finding her in all this, that was everything.

Overview
[
]


David is a calm and respectful man. He was the sole survivor of his previous camp which caused him to become very depressed and lonely. After he is brought into 
Alexandria
, he meets 
Betsy
, the two eventually becoming lovers. Betsy helps bring David's sanity back and he becomes a better person. David is shown to be helpful and brave as he volunteers to help deter a mega herd of walkers. When David is bitten, he shows little fear and accepts his impending doom. Knowing he is going to die, he states that he wants to see Betsy one last time. However, David becomes pessimistic and starts to think he won't make it back to Alexandria and tries to write a note for Betsy. 
Michonne
 tells him that he will make it. Unfortunately David gets devoured by walkers and doesn't make it back. This causes Betsy to become extremely depressed and eventually committing suicide.

Location Unknown

Nothing is known about David's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, David became part of a camp that was attacked by walkers and of which he was the only survivor. Over time, he felt lonely, defeated and feeling less human after losing everyone until he was found by 
Aaron
 and invited to go with him to a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
. On their way, they found and invited 
Betsy
 to join them. She quickly befriended David and made him change into a better person. The pair soon fell in love and eventually got married.



Season 6

"
First Time Again
"
[
]


David is among the volunteers to help build the wall on one of the roads to deter the mega herd in the operation to lure it away from Alexandria. When the walkers break free from the quarry and the plan is set into motion, David and the others take immediate action.



"
Thank You
"
[
]


When a part of the herd ventures away from the road into the woods due to a 
blaring horn
 coming from Alexandria, the group runs through the woods in an attempt to return to the community. As they are attacked by walkers, David is taken by surprise and is bitten on his back by a walker. Immediately accepting his inevitable fate, he tells the group they have to continue towards Alexandria no matter what. David later confesses to 
Michonne
 that he wants to return to the community so he can see his wife for one last time and be able to say goodbye to her before dying.  

While hiding inside a pet store in an abandoned town as 
Glenn
 and 
Nicholas
 head out to lure the walkers away, David grows pessimistic of his condition and writes a farewell note to his wife which he tries to hand to Michonne. However, she rejects it and assures him he will return to Alexandria himself to say goodbye. When the stray part of the herd arrives at the town, the group is forced to flee in a hurry. As they climb over some fences, David is dragged to the ground and pressed against the fence as he is devoured by the walkers as the others watch in horror and sadness. 



"
Heads Up
"
[
]


A zombified David is stumbled upon by Glenn at the fence where he died. He lifts himself off the gate and looks at Glenn briefly before Glenn sadly puts him down and takes David's note to 
Betsy
.
