[
]


Dianne is a stoic woman of few words, choosing when to chime in and voice her opinion. She is also one of action, preferring not to stand by while things go on around her, always willing to fight with her allies. She is shown to have a sarcastic sense of humor and is very loyal to the communities she lives in, proving to be a valuable asset in any kind of confrontation.

Ezekiel
's closest soldiers.

Dianne was present at the time of the arrival of a notorious group of survivors named 
the Saviors
 who operated on behalf of 
Negan
. Upon meeting, the Saviors demanded a portion of supplies in exchange for leaving the community unscathed, to which Ezekiel complied under the condition that the Saviors would never step foot inside the Kingdom.

"
Morning Star
"
[
]


Dianne joins the discussion about what should be done with the Whisperers. Lydia thinks they should run, explaining that even if the explosion at the cave took out half the horde, Alpha would still have thousands of walkers left. Earl thinks the Whisperers might bypass them and go for Alexandria first, but Lydia negates this. Jerry wishes to stay and fight instead, while Dianne agrees with Lydia, believing that they can rebuild in another location. Earl is skeptical, however, and reckons that they will never find a place as good as Hilltop. While Yumiko points out they're heavily outnumbered, Earl insists that fighting is the best course of action, and even if they die, they will die for a place that means something. Aaron points out that there are children at Hilltop, too. Daryl agrees that they should get the kids out first, and instructs the others to pack up and regroup at Oceanside.

The caravan doesn't make it far before they hit a roadblock and discover Felix and Penny (the scouts they sent earlier) dead. Daryl identifies this as one of Negan's tactics and concludes that all the other roads will be blocked, too, making a retreat impossible. The caravan returns to the Hilltop, with Daryl informing the others of the situation. Luke suggests calling Alexandria for reinforcements, but Dianne thinks that neither Alexandria nor Oceanside can get to them in time. Earl is confident that Hilltop is prepared, and tries to rally everyone for the upcoming conflict.

Dianne is seen gathered on the front lines, Kelly confirms that the horde is close. Indeed, the horde soon emerges from the bushes and approaches the Hilltop. While they are momentarily halted by the electric fence, the walkers soon break through it and approach the second line of defense. Aaron orders the survivors to split ranks. The shield-wielding survivors reinforce the makeshift barbed wire fence, while the melee weapon-wielding survivors start taking out the walkers. The archers, meanwhile, stay in the back and rain arrows on the herd.

However, they are surprised and some are impressed by the Commonwealth Army's skill in taking out a group of walkers with such precise aim and skill. After Maggie decides on behalf of her community that they will not accept a partnership with Commonwealth, some of the residents are dissatisfied, including Dianne. She discusses her beliefs with Maggie, and explains that she cannot continue to fight any longer, and makes the decision to move to the Commonwealth in hopes for a better future.

Family
"
[
]


After the death of 
the Warden
, Dianne and the others are freed from the Commonwealth's control. The morning following, Dianne helps by gathering supplies as the group prepares to attack 
Pamela Milton
, and boards one of the vehicles. She is able to aboard the train, and they eventually arrive at the depot and wait outside one of the tunnel entrances. Concerned, Dianne takes notice of two of the guards getting close, but are called off by Pamela before they notice anything. In a hurry, Dianne and the others make their way through the tunnels, and emerge into the Union Station that appears abandoned. Dianne moves quietly through the station, before Daryl realizes that something isn't right and notices it's a trap. He shouts for everyone to get down, and the Commonwealth begin to shoot the Coalition. Dianne takes cover underneath a flight of stairs, where she attempts to attack nearby enemies. Hiding with a few other members of her group, a man attempts to crawl to them for safety, but he shot down by one of Pamela's men.  

Once Judith is accidentally shot by Governor Milton, Dianne helps in escorting Daryl and the others through the city in order to reach the 
hospital

They continue to run, until they are blocked and trapped inside an alley with a hoard of walkers, as Dianne and the others notice the new walker variant climbing atop some crates and boxes. They eventually reunite with 
Jules
 and Luke before being closed in, and Dianne helps to make a way for Daryl through one of the alleys so that Judith can reach the hospital. Looking behind, Judith notices her allies being ambushed by a group of walkers, including Dianne.



"
Rest in Peace
"
[
]


While Daryl reaches the hospital with Judith, Dianne is able to break through the hoard of walkers and make her way out of the barricades and into the main city. She makes it to the 
police station
, where she helps to load supplies onto a truck, and takes off with a portion of the group as the walkers start to get closer. With the help of Mercer, they are able to get away unharmed. 

Dianne arrives at the hospital with the supplies, and waits for help as she and the others fend off incoming walkers. 
Lieutenant Rose
 arrives in another truck and reports to Mercer that they're all set: everyone is in the back and there's no one to check. The doctors have set up a safe house, but they have to hurry. Mercer calls for everyone to go, stating that they need to get Judith to 
Tomi
. Everyone boards the truck with Princess, Max, and Dianne pushing Judith's stretcher. 

Dianne arrives at the safe house in the Estates and takes notice of the people begging to be let inside. Eventually, she and her allies confront Pamela as she refuses to let anyone inside. With the walkers approaching, Dianne readies her weapon and prepares to attack Pamela's men as they refuse to cooperate. Daryl is able to convince the Commonwealth soldiers to let the people inside, and Dianne helps getting everyone inside before quickly closing the gates in time to prevent the walkers from breaking in. She then notices Pamela watching an undead 
Lance Hornsby
 at the gates as she approaches and watches him struggle. Dianne also witnesses Mercer's actions as he takes control of the situation and arrests Pamela for treason. 

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck travels through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne, and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates. Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

The following day, Dianne is one of the many sitting at a table indoors enjoying a feast. She is seen briefly talking to some of her friends and allies. One year later, it is assumed Dianne has made her home at the newly-reformed Commonwealth as she watches Governor Ezekiel and Deputy Governor Mercer give a speech to the city.
