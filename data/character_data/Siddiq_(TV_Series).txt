Later that day, Siddiq talks with Ezekiel in the infirmary when he starts coughing very aggressively. He then reveals to Siddiq a large lump on his neck.

Rosita
 but Siddiq reminds him about boundaries before leaving.

Later that day, Siddiq goes to Rosita's house to look for new clothes for Coco when he notices her lying sick on the couch. He decides to take her to the infirmary despite her objections. Upon arriving at the infirmary to find it full of sick people, Siddiq berates Dante for letting things get out of hand. He is calmed down by Rosita and rushes to prepare more herbal medications.

That night, Siddiq comforts a bedridden 
Cheryl

Siddiq wakes up in the infirmary after experiencing horrific flashbacks of 
Alpha
 killing his friends at the barn, while remembering the phrase "Open your eyes" being said to him. He finds 
Cheryl
 shaking from her fever, so he gives her a glass of water and covers her body with another blanket. He then checks up on 
Rosita
 and brings water to the other sick residents. While looking at his patients, he hallucinates seeing Alpha outside the window wearing her outfit from the fair. At night, Siddiq reads some medical books and takes notes until he falls asleep. He then imagines himself waking up to several hands grabbing him from under the couch and covering his mouth.

The next day, Siddiq and Dante are called to the cell to tend to the injuries of a 
Whisperer
 who has been taken hostage for questioning. When the Whisperer tells Siddiq he remembers him from the barn and starts to taunt him, Siddiq becomes nervous so Dante suggests him to head outside. As he leaves, Siddiq looks at the pointed spikes on the stairs and has a flashback to Alpha brutally decapitating 
D.J.
 in front of him. He then heads back to the infirmary to tend to a bedridden Rosita. The two of them joke about their fling and reflect on them being parents in the new world. He nearly kisses her until she has a coughing fit so he gives her more water before leaving to check on his other patients. Siddiq goes to Cheryl's room and they chat about how he needs to remain strong for the others.

Later that day, Siddiq arrives along with the others at the cell to help the Whisperer who suddenly starts convulsing. When Dante holds him, he spits blood onto his shoulder before dying from the poison. Siddiq then finds a jar of hemlock in the medical backpack and accuses Dante of killing him. However, Dante lies and says he was responsible for packing it. A while later, Siddiq goes to Cheryl's room to check on her but finds it empty and encounters Dante digging a grave as her covered body lays nearby. He walks away upset and then experiences more flashbacks from the pikes. Unable to stop them, Siddiq jumps into the pond. He remembers being told to open his eyes as 
Enid
 is decapitated. Rosita then jumps into the water and pulls him out.

Shortly after, Rosita questions Siddiq about what's really going on in his mind. He breaks down and explains he can't escape his memories about the night their friends were killed by the Whisperers. She assures him that he is doing everything he can but he says he feels he failed Enid and that he misses her. Rosita demands he pull through and fight it for her and Coco and everyone else. While talking about the sickness, Siddiq realizes that the water is what is making people sick. He heads to inspect the water pumps and after discovering one of the levers had been tampered with, he begins throwing things around out of frustration and anger.

That night, Siddiq gazes out the window in his house when Dante arrives to comfort him. He explains that everything is going to be okay because Alexandria is a special place, before declaring that Siddiq is his friend. He then starts clicking his tongue, which triggers Siddiq back to the 
beheadings
 and makes him realize that Dante was the Whisperer forcing him to watch as his friends were killed. They soon start fighting in the room as Siddiq tries to reach for a machete. Dante tackles him to the ground and puts him in a chokehold. 
"I didn't want this! Not you! Not like this. Close your eyes... Close your eyes,"
 Dante tells Siddiq in sorrow as he chokes him harder until he falls dead.

Rosita
. Though Dante lies about Siddiq's whereabouts, Rosita quickly grows suspicious and Dante attacks while Siddiq reanimates. Drawn by his daughter's cries, the reanimated Siddiq nearly attacks Coco. However, Rosita manages to overpower Dante and puts Siddiq down with Dante's knife to the head before he can hurt anybody.

The next day, Siddiq is buried in the Alexandria graveyard and a funeral is held by Gabriel who recites a passage in his memory as Rosita and the residents mourn his death.

Siddiq appears in Michonne's hallucinations, where Siddiq tells her to picture the sun. Michonne is at first glad to see him, but he starts blaming her for his death, as well as the deaths of Rick and Carl. Siddiq then asks what will happen to his family with him gone. Michonne tearfully states that Siddiq is her family, but the latter replies "this is what it feels like to be your family".

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Abbud
.
[4]


Siddiq was described as "An innately likable Muslim American whose nerves are, let’s say, jangled, because he’s flown solo for too long in Zombieland."


His mother and him believe that killing the 
walkers
 will "free their souls", allowing the dead to be at peace.


He is the only character known to purposely count how many zombies he kills.


Siddiq is arachnophobic, as he states in the episode "
A New Beginning
" that he is afraid of spiders. Interestingly enough, 
Avi Nash
 (Siddiq's actor), is afraid of spiders, as well.


He is shown to be suffering from PTSD after the events of "
The Calm Before
".

Avi Nash admitted in an interview (shown on 
Talking Dead
 after episode "
Bonds
") that Siddiq does suffer from PTSD and said that Siddiq is a threat.

In

The World Before
", Siddiq is credited as

, giving him two In Memorium appearances following his death in "
Open Your Eyes
".


Siddiq is one of four main characters to not be killed by a main character or walkers, the others being  
Beth Greene
,
