Trivia






Overview


Jody's personality is not well-known and his morals are generally left ambiguous. He takes part in the 
Governor
's attack on the 
Prison
, showing he can be ruthless. Later, Jody is found by 
Carl
 and 
Hershel
 in the woods and surrenders. Hershel orders Jody to drop his weapon which Jody seemingly is about to comply too. However, his behavior is quite shady and suspicious, as instead of immediately dropping his weapon, he instead slowly moves towards Carl and tells him to take his weapon. Carl shoots Jody before he can do anything else, leaving it unknown whether Jody would've tried something or was genuinely going to surrender. Jody's death stuck with Carl for the rest of his life. Before his own death, Carl expresses regret for killing Jody and has thought about it everyday.



Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Jody's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse


Nothing is known about Jody's life after the outbreak, except that he had taken shelter in 
Woodbury
 and enlisted in 
the Governor
's army to fight 
Rick Grimes
' group at the prison.



Season 3


"
Welcome to the Tombs
"


Jody is seen as part of 
the Governor
's army, in which they assault the prison. He enters the prison's tombs and after being fired on and nearly attacked by zombies, he flees outside.

Jody runs into the woods where 
Carl Grimes
, 
Hershel Greene
, and 
Beth Greene
 are hiding. Jody is caught by the group and ordered by Hershel to drop his weapon. Jody complies and surrenders, but Carl, nonetheless, coldly shoots him in the head and kills him, much to Hershel's horror.

Later on, Hershel informs 
Rick
 what Carl did to Jody, and Carl later explains to Rick why he murdered Jody, claiming that it was for the safety of the group, using 
Dale Horvath
's, 
Merle Dixon
's, and his mother 
Lori
's deaths as examples of ones that could have been prevented by killing beforehand.



Season 8


"
Honor
"


Carl tells Rick and 
Michonne
 about his murder of Jody and how he killed Jody as he was surrendering. Carl expresses regret for killing Jody and states that he's thought about it every day since and how easy it was for him to do.
