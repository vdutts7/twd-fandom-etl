,,,Nothing is known about Adrienne's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"Adrienne survived the early stages of the outbreak and eventually found herself as a member of a large group of survivors led by a woman named 
Natania
. Unfortunately, her group would be discovered by a large, hostile 
organization of survivors
 led by 
Simon
 (who later became 
Negan
's ruthless and sadistic second-in-command) and under his orders, Adrienne and her people were forced to gather and provide supplies for them under threat of death. Eventually, under Natania's orders, the group initiated a rebellion to fight back against their oppressors. However, due to being outgunned and outnumbered, their group was defeated. As punishment for their defiance and to deter any further resistance, Simon had his group murder every male survivor above the age of 10 in Adrienne's group. It is unknown if any of Adrienne's family were among the casualties of the rebellion or subsequent massacre.
Following this and being unwilling to continue working for Simon and his group, Adrienne and her group, consisting mainly of females now, fled their community and established a new home at a location called 
Oceanside
 and reestablished their community hidden from them. In order to prevent Simon and his group from finding them again, Natania ordered any survivor who happened upon the community to be immediately killed in order to maintain the secrecy of their new home.
