“


We were at a refugee center together and there was a fire. People were just trampling over me. Sam saved my life. We didn't know each other before. It didn't heal right, but it healed. And we found each other. It was worth it.

Overview
[
]


Ana, like her boyfriend 
Sam
, is an unusually trusting and optimistic survivor. She is shown to be quite generous, offering  
Rick
 and 
Carol
 fruit. It is revealed that she and Sam met after he saved her when her leg got trampled. She is not combat-proficient and has stated to take around 5 or 6 shots just to kill a single walker. She and Sam insist on helping gather supplies despite their poor condition. Rick argues against this, thinking they are unfit to go scavenging, but she and Sam convince him. Unfortunately, Rick is proven to be correct when Ana is later found devoured by walkers.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Ana's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Unknown Refugee Center
[
]


Sometime before the events of the episode "
Indifference
", Ana and 
Sam
 were at a refugee center when a fire broke out. The resulting mob of refugees escaping the fire trampled over Ana, leaving one of her legs crippled. Sam saved her from further injury from the mob, an act which resulted in a close relationship between Sam and Ana. Her leg, however, did not heal correctly, causing her to have trouble moving quickly. Ana and Sam were then separated from their original group, leaving them to rely on each other for survival.



Season 4
[
]


"
Indifference
"
[
]


While scavenging for supplies in a neighborhood, 
Rick
 and 
Carol
 find Ana with Sam in a house, trapped in a bathroom because they could not kill the 
one walker
 outside. After Carol killed the walker, Ana and Sam, in gratitude, offer them fruit they found in the house. Carol then fixes Sam's dislocated shoulder, to which Ana is grateful for. When asked why they couldn't kill the walker, Ana and Sam admit that they aren't very adept in killing "
skin-eaters
", and were "trying to play it safe" since it was only the two of them now. Rick then asks them the three questions (the same ones he asked 
Clara
), and he and Carol allow them to be part of the 
prison
 group. Despite Rick's reluctance, Ana goes to get fruits from the nearby greenhouse to prove her worth as a new group member. Rick and Carol later find her severed leg and, in the distance, her body being devoured by 
walkers
.

As Rick and Carol begin returning to the meeting place, at which they were to meet with the young couple, they come across a lone basket and scattered fruit on the ground. Upon further investigation they find Ana's severed leg and, in the distance, her body being devoured by walkers. 

It is not known who or what caused her leg to be severed, and whether her severed leg was what killed her or prevented her from escaping nearby walkers.
