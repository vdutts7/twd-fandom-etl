""","Richards was portrayed by Darian Fisher while Dalton Louis Simons portrayed the charred, reanimated Richards.

A second actor was used to portray the charred, reanimated Richards due to time constraints in filming Fisher's scenes and then getting him ready in full makeup and prosthetics for the latter scene.


Not all of the scenes involving Richards made it into the final episode including when he was standing at the top of the wall, listening to the Wolves attack Alexandria and having Molotov cocktails thrown at him.
