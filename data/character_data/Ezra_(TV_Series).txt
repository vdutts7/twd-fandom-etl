You know Ezra, your 
dad
 saved this from 
Hilltop
 when it burned, because he knew how precious it was to me. But there's something actually more precious and that that is your family. So this leash is yours on two conditions. One, that is always makes you as happy as it made me and two, that you honor 
Shiva
's memory.

Post-Apocalypse


Virginia


At some point after the end of the 
war
, 
Jerry
 and 
Nabila
 had three children, with Ezra being the oldest.

In 
the Kingdom
, Ezra spends time with his family as everyone is setting things ready for the fair. He and his sister then wave at Jerry as he leaves on a deer hunting mission.



"
Chokepoint
"


After Jerry and a squadron of Kingdom soldiers return from a mission, Ezra runs up to his father and hugs him.



"
The Calm Before
"


Ezra releases some doves as Ezekiel finishes his speech and Jerry announces the start of the fair. At the fair, he plays with his sister and father. At night, he and his family attend the theater and watch the movie.



"
The Storm
"


Several months after the fair massacre, the Kingdommers are forced to abandon their fallen community due to an incoming blizzard and move to the Hilltop. When snow starts falling later that day, Ezra and the convoy is forced to take shelter inside the Sanctuary for the night where he and his family rest and stay warm.

Later that night, the convoy leaves the factory and is forced to cross into Alpha's territory. When they encounter a frozen lake, members of the group kill walkers that emerge from the snowbanks before the whole convoy manages to escape safely across the ice where Ezra and his siblings are embraced by their parents, who are glad for their safety. The next morning, the convoy finally arrives at the Hilltop where Ezra spends time with his family in their new community.



Season 10


"
Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Ezra is brought alongside some children to see the beach for the first at Oceanside while the militia trains. Afterwards, he and his sister play with R.J. and Judith in the sand. When a satellite falls from the sky later that day, Ezra and his sister are protected by Jerry.



"
Morning Star
"


Ezra is among the children and parents to be evacuated from Hilltop. However, the caravan is prevented from reaching Oceanside after reaching a roadblock consisting of a fallen tree, the doings of the Whisperers. The caravan turns back to Hilltop, along with the bodies of murdered scouts 
Felix
 and 
Penny
. That night, he takes refuge inside Hilltop along with his mother and siblings as well as with the other children and civilians as the coalition soldiers fight against the Whisperers and their horde.



"
Walk With Us
"


The Whisperers attack the Hilltop Colony with their horde and flaming arrows - setting fire to the Colony. 
Ezekiel
 began to lead the children out of Hilltop - including Ezra - but could not locate Judith. 
Earl Sutton
 was able to locate Judith and took charge of Ezra and the other children while Ezekiel fought at the Hilltop.

Earl brought Ezra and the other children to a safe-house in the woods awaiting for their parents while he continued to suffer from the bite from a walker on his arm. He refilled Ezra's water cup and reassured the children that their parents would be proud of them. While Ezra and the rest of the children remained together, Judith took care of Earl in the backroom before he could turn and harm the others. When Ezekiel, Daryl, and Jerry find the shack in the woods, Ezra and his sister reunite with their father.



"
Look at the Flowers
"


Ezra is at the rendezvous with the rest of his family recovering from the Hilltop battle and awaiting for more survivors to arrive.



"
A Certain Doom
"


Ezra is among the Hilltop survivors to relocate to an abandoned hospital referred to as the "
Tower
" where he and his family, and dozens of others, seek refuge on the upper floors of the hospital. As a group of survivors enact a plan to lure the herd away, others defend the hospital from the Whisperers and snipe as many as they can from the windows. When the Whisperers eventually break into the hospital, Ezra and the others are evacuated safely from the hospital via the elevator shafts and basement tunnels. After 
Beta
 and the Whisperers are wiped out, the remaining survivors congregate in the woods where the injured are treated and families are reunited. Ezra sits with his mother and siblings as 
Bertie
 greets them and chats with the family.

late brother
.
