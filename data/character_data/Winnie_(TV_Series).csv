However in actuality, Winnie, like the rest of her group, is a brutal, ruthless, and hardened survivor who was brainwashed by Jocelyn to become a remorseless killer. She shoots Daryl in the chest and painfully burns Michonne . She is shown to be completely loyal to Jocelyn and follows her orders without question. After Jocelyn's death, Winnie is shown to be shocked. She is then ordered by Mitchell to kill all of the children. However, Winnie seems to be quite hesitant about this and stops to look at Michonne when she calls out her name. After the death of the rest of her group, Winnie ultimately doesn't follow through with killing the children and cries at the sight of her dead friends. She runs away and is never seen again.",Nothing is known about Winnie's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"In a flashback, Winnie, Jocelyn , and Mitchell are found by a group from Alexandria in the woods and are brought to the community.
