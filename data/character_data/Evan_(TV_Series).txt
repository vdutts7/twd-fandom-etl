Overview
[
]


Evan is as a member of the 
Saviors
 and is among those captured from the 
Satellite Outpost
. After 
Simon
 shows that he doesn't care about the 38 captured Saviors, Evan becomes disillusioned with the Saviors. When he and some others escape 
Hilltop
, they begin to question where to go. After 
Rick
 gives his offer to have them come back to Hilltop, he and many others begin to consider the option. However, this is revealed to be a trick to lower their guard. After they are freed, Rick and 
Morgan
 proceed to kill the Saviors. Enraged by this, Evan tackles Rick and attempts to avenge his fellow Saviors, but ends up being subdued and thrown into the 
walkers
.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Evan's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Evan somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined.

Evan aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 8
[

"
Still Gotta Mean Something
"
[
]


Having escaped from the 
Hilltop
, Evan and the other escaped Savior prisoners capture 
Rick
 and 
Morgan
 near the 
abandoned dive bar
 they are resting at. With injured comrades, the Saviors argue over what to do, particularly as Rick reveals that a herd is on the way. 
Jared
 insists on killing them and to head to the Sanctuary when Rick offers the Saviors a chance to return to the Hilltop and join the community, in which Evan and a few others seem to seriously consider Rick's offer.

As the herd attacks the bar, Evan watches in horror as Rick and Morgan kill all of his fellow men in an act of betrayal. Evan angrily attacks Rick and tries to take his hatchet, but is subsequently pushed away by Rick into the path of oncoming walkers, who devour him alive.
