Location Unknown

Not much is known about Enid's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she was living with her parents. She also used to cut her 
father
's hair.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Enid and her parents had been surviving on their own for an extended amount of time. While trying to jump-start their car, Enid's parents were killed by a swarm of walkers, leaving Enid by herself. Following their tragic deaths, she wandered in the wilderness for several months, and in order to survive, she followed her own mantra and had to recur to basic survival methods, such as eating what she could gather and sometimes wild animals like turtles.

Eventually, Enid wandered up to the gates of the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
, albeit reluctantly, and was welcomed in by the community. She lived with 
Olivia
 during her stay, and it took her three weeks to say a single word to anyone because of the shock that she had experienced outside. As time passed by, Enid entered into a relationship with 
Ron Anderson
 and, because she was convinced that Alexandria would fall sooner or later, she started to sneak out of the community and spend time wandering around the woods to remind herself what the actual world was like.

Remember
"

Eight months after her arrival at the safe-zone, Enid lingers outside the walls when 
Rick Grimes
' group approaches the safe-zone gates. 
Carl
 looks around and sees her watching from one of the burnt houses. When Ron introduces Carl to 
Mikey
 and Enid, she acts cold towards Carl, after noticing he is overwhelmed by his new environment, and simply keeps reading her comic book on the bed.

Later that day, Enid climbs over the fences and sneaks out of Alexandria into the woods. Carl tries to follow her, but she gives him the slip and goes to an unknown place. When Enid returns to the community, she witnesses the confrontation between newcomer 
Glenn Rhee
 and 
Aiden Monroe
. Carl then asks her if she doesn't like him, but Enid ignores him. 



"
Try
"
[
]


When Enid leaves the community again, Carl tries to follow her again but appears to lose sight of her. She suddenly calls him out from an unseen location, saying that he is too loud. He tries to persuade her to go back, but she tells him that he scares her. Enid then invites him to run along with her into the woods.

While they are resting, Carl tries to ask about her past, but Enid just remarks that they belong outside the walls. A group of walkers approach and they hide inside a hollow tree trunk. She says that the world belongs to walkers now, and the survivors are just living in their world. He briefly touches her hand and leans in to kiss her, but stops, and Enid teases him that he is afraid of her too. When they return to Alexandria, Enid witnesses the brawl between Rick and 
Pete Anderson
.

Wolves
 infiltrates Alexandria and brutally slaughters its citizens. Carl believes he is under attack, but opens the door to find Enid, who is shocked to see him pointing a weapon at her. She tells Carl that she is leaving Alexandria and came to say goodbye. Carl refuses to let her go outside and makes her help him protect his sister 
Judith
 from the Wolves. Whilst on guard, Enid tells Carl that Alexandria is too big to protect everyone. Carl tells her not to tell him goodbye, to which Enid replies that she won't.  

When Ron is being chased by a Wolf in the streets, Enid and Carl leave the house to help him. Carl shoots the Wolf and tells Ron to come inside for protection, but Ron refuses due to his strained relationship with Carl and leaves. Sometime after the attack, Enid keeps her promise to Carl and quietly leaves the safe-zone, only leaving behind a note for him to find that says "Just Survive Somehow".

Heads Up

After Enid spends the night in an abandoned town, she spots the next day as 
Glenn
 emerges from under a dumpster following the semi-failed herd movement plan, and throws him a water bottle down. She informs him that Alexandria was attacked and then runs away before he can question her further. Glenn chases Enid into the street but loses her. 

Enid manages to remain hidden for several hours around the abandoned buildings of the town. When she hides from walkers inside a restaurant, Glenn finds her and orders her to return to Alexandria. She points a gun at him but begrudgingly complies when he wrests it away from her. As they are making their way back to the safe-zone, Enid confesses the reason she left was that she is afraid of losing the people she cares about.

Later that day, they come across green balloons left over from the walker-herding mission, and Enid suggests they use them to distract walkers. Glenn directs her to a bush concealing more balloons and a helium tank. As Enid inflates more balloons, Glenn lectures her about acting rashly out of fear. They then arrive at Alexandria to find it surrounded by walkers. Enid's mood sinks but Glenn insists they forge ahead.

Start to Finish

Maggie
 trapped on an unsteady guard tower. Enid's hope shrinks even more after seeing this.



"
No Way Out
"
[

Enid and Glenn carefully sneak into a church outside of Alexandria to search for weapons that may be hidden that they could use to save Maggie. Whilst searching, Enid finds a Bible quote on the church walls: "Faith without works is dead." This reminds her of the loss of her parents. She asks Glenn what he meant when he said if you run, you lose people, even after they're gone. He tells her that she has to hold on to who she is to honor those who have made her the person she is and that her parents are not dead because Enid is alive.

When Glenn asks her to stay at the church whilst he saves Maggie, Enid utterly refuses, saying that she can handle herself and insists she will help him save her because he was right that they must not give up on Alexandria. Enid formulates a plan to get Maggie down and informs him that she will follow him even without his consent. She eventually finds a gun and hands it to him. When asked once more to stay at the church, Enid refuses again. 

Later that night, they enter Alexandria. Glenn distracts the walkers by shooting them, drawing them away from the platform Maggie is trapped on whilst Enid runs over to Maggie and climbs up and joins her, where they see that Glenn is becoming overrun by walkers, but they are relieved when 
Abraham Ford
 and 
Sasha Williams
 open fire on the walkers, saving Glenn's life at the last minute. Enid and Maggie are helped down shortly after.

Enid and the others then get into the truck that 
Daryl
, Sasha, and Abraham used to return to Alexandria and leave a fuel trail, then light it on fire, luring the walkers in and killing a large number of them whilst Rick and the Alexandrians kill the rest of the walkers.

She then reminds her that she's around if she wants to talk and leaves as Enid considers the proposal.

Later that day, Enid and Carl are walking in the woods when she wonders why they keep coming out there. 
"Because we're kids, that's what they do,"
 says Carl. 
"We're not kids,"
 Enid mutters in response. When they hear a noise, Enid hides and Carl draws his gun, but they relax once Carl realizes it's just Spencer and 
Michonne
. Enid announces that she doesn't want to come out anymore. As they head back, they encounter a zombified 
Deanna

Later that day, Enid rides a bike down an empty road, where she encounters a walker. Out of nowhere, Carl ramps into the walker and comes out of the crashed car. He says he has decided to join her. 

As they walk down a road, Carl tells her he is glad he watched as 
Negan
 killed Glenn and Abraham because he needed that memory. He knew it would motivate him to kill Negan. Later that day, Carl finds roller skates in a backpack on the side of the road. He and Enid hold hands and smile as they skate down the road. 

Upon arriving at Hilltop, they see as several Saviors are loading up their trucks. Enid realizes that Carl left Alexandria not to accompany her, but to track down Negan and kill him. She asks Carl not to go, but he sticks to his mission. Carl kisses her forehead, leading them to share a romantic kiss with each other.

The Oceanside crew comes back in and unchains them, only to stand them up and handcuff them again. 
"You better have a good reason for killing us other than to make yourself feel better because it won't,"
 Enid says. She warns Cyndie that her group will come for them if they are killed and eventually take them out completely.

Cyndie changes her mind and sets them free. Taking them to the forest, Cyndie refuses to join the fight, feeling that what they've already contributed was enough.

Having healed from her injuries in the following weeks, Enid moved from the Hilltop to the work camp to help in the infirmary under Siddiq's guidance. One morning, she is stitching Cyndie's hand when Rick orders Siddiq to return home with the next escort crew. Feeling confident in his assistant, Enid is left in charge of the patients. 

Later that day, Enid is shocked and horrified when Daryl rushes an injured Aaron to the infirmary after a log fell on his arm while dealing with walkers at the construction site. She examines his injury and quickly decides they need to amputate. Aaron reluctantly agrees as Daryl ties the tourniquet. Enid gains confidence and amputates his arm. That night, Rick visits Aaron to check on him, and thanks Enid for her help.

In the years following Rick's presumed death, Enid became the Hilltop doctor and eventually entered a relationship with Alden. Six years later, Enid checks on her patients in the community infirmary and gives a message to Tara for Jesus where she asks for more space on the fields for natural remedies. When an injured Rosita is found in the woods and is brought to the community, Enid helps her and then looks after her while she rests.

When Michonne and Siddiq arrive at Hilltop with a group of newcomers, Enid informs Siddiq of Rosita's condition and assures him she would recover soon. Later that day, she goes to the blacksmith tent to check on 
Henry
 and, after noticing he is learning fast from Alden, jokes that they should swap places from their communities. Enid then takes Alden aside to talk with him for a moment and leaves after kissing him goodbye.

Enid talks with Tara, Alden, 
D.J.
, and Marco to organize a search party for the group that went out to look for a missing Eugene since they haven't returned. Before Alden leaves with Luke, she kisses him and wishes him good luck. When the original search group arrives back later that day, a devastated Enid looks at Jesus' body in sadness and is comforted by Aaron. She then assists the funeral and is among the residents to hammer nails in his coffin. When the ceremony ends, Enid awaits for Alden at the guard post and is assured by Magna that he's in good company.

Enid treats Earl for a hand injury and suggests he retire to avoid future injuries, but he refuses. Tammy thanks Enid for helping and assures her Alden will turn up. When Alpha arrives outside the gates with a group of Whisperers to offer trading Alden and Luke for her captive daughter, Enid helps to look around the community for the missing Lydia. 

Upon being informed that Henry has taken Lydia to a nearby cabin for safety, Enid goes along with Addy into the woods and tries to convince him to give up Lydia so they can save Alden and Luke. She explains she had to watch her parents die and how Carl told her she has to live for more than survival. Henry's torn so Lydia offers to give herself up to save their friends. Enid then watches as Lydia kisses Henry goodbye and the group heads back to Hilltop. 

Later that day, Enid watches from the gates as Daryl hands Lydia over to Alpha in exchange for Alden and Luke. She then embraces Alden and says she will never let him go. At night, the couple makes love inside their room.  



"
The Calm Before
"
[
]


Enid is among the Hilltop residents that assist the fair in the Kingdom. She watches from the crowd as 
Ezekiel
 declares they've finally accomplished Rick, Carl, and Jesus' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. When Luke tries convincing Alden to perform with him despite losing a bet, Enid accidentally calls Alden her boyfriend, who reacts surprised and accepts to sing for her. 

At some point later that day, Enid is somehow among the residents kidnapped by Alpha and taken away to a barn in the woods where they are about to be attacked by the Whisperers but are found by 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and D.J., giving the group a chance to fight back. During the fight, Enid manages to take down a Whisperer. In the middle of the chaos, Alpha arrives and the group is subdued. She then decapitates everyone as Siddiq is forced to watch, only leaving him alive as a witness. Enid's decapitated head is later put by Alpha on one of the several pikes used for the Whisperers' border.

The next day, Daryl, Michonne, Carol, Siddiq, and 
Yumiko
 find the border and watch in horror at the victims, a reanimated Enid being among them. They then put down their zombified heads to properly rest. When the group returns to the Kingdom, Siddiq delivers the tragic news and narrates how Enid and the others fought together as a family in their last moments. He finishes the story by encouraging everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.
