Overview
[
]


Judith appears to be a kind, intelligent and caring young girl, mature beyond her years who is more than willing to protect others from harm, as shown when she protects 
Magna
's 
group
 from a horde of 
walkers
. Even in her young age, Judith appears to already be very adapt with weapons and fighting against walkers, most likely having been taught how to use them by 
Michonne Grimes
, as she is seen carrying a 
katana
.

According to 
Negan
, Judith is just as much of a badass as her brother and is able to tell when someone is lying to her to the point that Negan never even tries. Due to Michonne's attempts at sheltering her, Judith has developed a bond with Negan who shares stories and helps her with her homework. Judith tells Michonne that while she knows that Negan is not her friend, she is sympathetic with his lonely situation while Negan affords Judith a great deal of respect in return. Judith has Michonne's fiery spirit and determination and as pointed out by Negan, hates taking things lying down just as much as Michonne does. Like Negan, she has a sarcastic sense of humor.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Judith Grimes is the second child born to 
Lori Grimes
 and is the first infant depicted having been born during the apocalypse. Her parents express hope that she will not live in constant fear as they do, and they wish that she will accept the post-apocalyptic world as the way things are without referencing the way things used to be.

From the moment Lori discovers that she is pregnant with Judith, questions arise as to who the baby's biological father is. Lori has an affair with 
Shane
, Rick's best friend, prior to her discovering that Rick is still alive. Rick later revealed that he knows that Judith is not his biological daughter, but he loves her regardless and is willing to protect her at all costs.  

Judith was born on June 20, 2011 in the 
West Georgia Correctional Facility
. She was not immediately named upon her birth, and it took the group several days to decide on one. Carl suggested they name her "Sophia", after his late friend 
Sophia Peletier
, and is nicknamed "Lil' Ass Kicker" by 
Daryl Dixon
. Carl ultimately decided to name Judith after his third grade teacher, 
Judith Mueller
.

Carl
, and Maggie exit the prison, and Rick notices Maggie holding the baby without Lori's presence. Rick begins to sob upon realizing that Lori did not survive.

.



"
Made to Suffer
"


Judith briefly appears in this episode being cradled by

Michonne
, Glenn, and Maggie are in

"
30 Days Without An Accident

Judith appears briefly in this episode. She looks more grown up, hinting that it has been a couple of months since she was born. It is shown that even if she is not Rick's biological daughter, he has adopted her as his own.



"
Infected
"


Judith is shown with Rick in the beginning of the episode. Beth takes care of her while the zombies attack Cell Block D. Rick tells everyone they cannot go near Judith because they could get her infected. Michonne seems bothered by her presence. Later, Judith vomits on Beth. In reaction, Beth asks Michonne to hold her, to which Michonne sternly replied, "No." However, Michonne then gives in and takes her uneasily. After a few seconds of Beth being gone, Michonne breaks down emotionally and holds Judith close to her. 



"

"
Too Far Gone

Tyreese Williams
, 
Lizzie Samuels
, and her sister 
Mika
 manage to save her. The reason for her baby carrier being bloody is unknown. Her desperate father and brother, though, assume that she is dead.



"
Inmates
"


Judith is seen in the arms of Tyreese after the attack, and she cannot stop crying. After Tyreese hears a scream from the railroad, he leaves her with Lizzie.

Judith is last seen traveling with Tyreese, Carol, Lizzie, and Mika along some railroad tracks. 



"
The Grove
"


Judith appears throughout the episode, often in the safety of either Tyreese or Carol in a baby carrier, which the two take turns wearing on their backs. While Tyreese and Carol are clearing out the cabin at the pecan grove, a walker suddenly falls over the first-story railing of the house. Unable to kill it (because she believes that walkers are still "alive"), Lizzie freezes up in fear with Judith in her arms as the walker lunges quickly toward them along the ground. Eventually, it is shot in the head by Mika, saving Lizzie and Judith's lives. Later on, in order to prove to Tyreese and Carol that walkers are not different from living people, Lizzie kills Mika by stabbing her, taking care to preserve her brain so that she will "come back". After she is discovered kneeling by Mika's body, she tells Tyreese and Carol that she had intended to do the same thing to Judith before Tyreese and Carol returned.  However, Judith is seen off to the side of Mika's corpse, alive and lying on a blanket. Though saddened by Mika's death, Carol focuses on the situation at hand and dissuades Lizzie from harming Judith, telling her that, "She can't even walk yet," and would therefore not make a very good walker. Lizzie agrees. Knowing that Lizzie is dangerous, Tyreese offers to leave with Judith and part ways with Carol so that Carol could carry on with Lizzie. However, Carol disagrees with the idea and reluctantly kills Lizzie with the safety of the three of them in mind. After Lizzie and Mika are buried, Carol and Tyreese continue to proceed towards 
Terminus
 with Judith in the tow.

"
No Sanctuary
"


Judith is still in the care of Tyreese and Carol. As Carol, Judith, and Tyreese approach another Terminus sign, a walker appears at their back, which makes Judith cry. Carol quickly dispatches the walker just in time to notice that a large herd is heading their way. Tyreese, now carrying Judith, and Carol hide in the woods, so as not to attract the herd's attention. Just when things start to turn into a bad situation for them, gunfire is heard, attracting the walkers and leading them away from the group. After taking a small cabin from a Terminant named 
Martin
, Carol leaves Judith with Tyreese so that she can rescue the others. Afterwards, Martin tells Tyreese that either he himself dies, Tyreese dies, or the baby dies if Carol does not return. Tyreese negates this saying, "Nobody is gonna die today." Three walkers come out from the woods and distract Tyreese, which Martin uses to his advantage. He jumps up and grabs Judith's head, threatening to kill her if Tyreese does not go outside where the walkers are waiting. Tyreese goes outside so that Martin does not kill Judith. After a brief struggle with walkers, Tyreese returns and severely beats Martin, saving Judith. After rescuing the others, Carol brings Rick and Carl back to the cabin, where they reunite with Judith, joyfully hugging her. She is last seen being carried by Carol as the group leaves the site of Terminus to an unknown location, a place Rick says is 'somewhere far' from the now overrun, ransacked Terminus.



"
Strangers
"


Rick's group continues on their journey away from Terminus when they come across 
Father Gabriel Stokes
, whom they save from a group of walkers. He takes the survivors back to his church, where they plan to stay for a while as they stock up on supplies. After scavenging the nearby area, the group enjoys a feast, and Rick uses the time to spend with Judith. 
Abraham Ford
 makes a speech, where he talks about his desire for Rick's group to join him and about 
Rosita Espinosa
 on their mission to escort 
Eugene Porter
 to Washington, D.C. Judith makes a noise during his speech, and Rick interprets this as her consent, lightheartedly saying that if Judith is in, then he is, too.



"
Four Walls and a Roof
"


When various members of the group go missing, several survivors go out to search for them. They eventually find 
Bob Stookey
, who has been kidnapped by 
Gareth
 and the other surviving residents of Terminus. Rick leads a group out to confront Gareth and deal with them, while several others stay behind. Judith is among them, who is being cared for by Tyreese. After Rick's group leaves, the Hunters turn up and break into the church. Judith cries and gives away the group's hiding place, but before Gareth and his people can do anything, they are captured and slaughtered by Rick and the others.

The following morning, the group says their goodbyes to Bob, who is dying from a bite on his shoulder. Judith sits on Rick's lap as he has one final talk with Bob. Bob thanks Rick for taking him in at the prison and advises him that the nightmare will end, but it does not have to end who they are. He tells Rick to look at Judith and see for himself that the world will someday change. He passes away shortly after.



"
Crossed
"


When Daryl returns from Atlanta with the news that Carol and Beth are being held in a hospital, Rick and several others prepare to go on a mission to save them, but they fortify the church before they leave. Rick holds Judith and gives her a kiss before handing her to Michonne, who is staying behind with Carl and Gabriel. Judith begins to cry as Rick leaves, and Carl strengthened the front door.

Unbeknownst to Michonne and Carl, Gabriel sneaks out of the church shortly after. 



"
Coda
"


Gabriel returns to the church after sneaking out and begs to be let inside as a herd of walkers are after him. Carl lets him in, but the walkers pour inside. Michonne attempts to hold them off, but there were too many, leaving them with no choice but to escape and abandon the church, while Carl carries Judith. They circle around to the front and shut the walkers inside.

Just as the front door begins to give way, Abraham and his group, who had left a few days previously, return with a firetruck and block the door, preventing the walkers from escaping. The group reunites and Michonne reveals to an elated Maggie that Beth is alive and that Rick and the others have gone to rescue her. They all decide to go help out.

Judith is presumably with Carl in the firetruck as the group arrives at the hospital, where they reunite with Rick and the others, and Maggie breaks down into tears upon seeing Daryl carrying Beth's corpse.

"
What Comes After

In Alexandria, Judith talks with Michonne about shells before they are interrupted by Scott. Scott tells Michonne that Maggie is there and Judith reacts happily "Aunt Maggie!".

Six years later, 
Magna
's 
group
 take on a herd of walkers. They quickly get overwhelmed but are saved when the walkers around them get shot from the trees. Magna and her group escape into the woods to find an older Judith, around 9 years old, armed with Rick's revolver and a katana. They introduce themselves and ask what her name is. She picks up her hat and introduces herself as Judith Grimes.



"
Who Are You Now?
"


In the woods, Judith leads Magna's group to the others, who are looking for her. Wanting to take them in, Judith declares she won't return to Alexandria until they accept them. The others reluctantly agree. 

In Alexandria, Magna's group arrives at the gates and Judith assures them they'll be safe. They get escorted inside, where Gracie runs over to Aaron. Rosita updates Siddiq on Yumiko's condition and he escorts her to the infirmary. Magna tries to tag along but is stopped by D.J. 

Michonne arrives on horseback and doesn't look pleased to see the new arrivals. She frisks Magna and asks Eugene why they're here. Aaron claims it was his call but Michonne reminds him it's not his call to make. 
"I decided,"
 Judith tells her. Michonne scolds her but Aaron says they're here now and they should decide their fate together, while Gabriel suggests they vote tomorrow. Michonne agrees and instructs her people to put them in holding. She leaves as her sheriff figurine falls out of her pocket and Judith picks it up. 

The next day, Judith is present when Magna's group are questioned by the Alexandria council. Later, in their house, Judith overhears Michonne pretending to talk to Rick, but Michonne catches her and tells her to do her homework and that they will train later. 

A while later, Judith sits outside of Negan's cell and reads off a math problem to him about two planes on a collision course. He stops her and asks if she's ever seen a plane and she says no, so Negan suggests she worry about problems that apply to the real world. Judith then tells him that Michonne wants to make Magna's group leave but she doesn't want them to. Negan uses an anecdote from his childhood about a seemingly nice stray dog that turned violent, meaning just because someone looks nice doesn't mean they are. Judith brushes it off and says the numbers don't care if someone's good or bad on the inside. Negan smiles as she leaves.

At night, after Michonne finishes talking with Magna, she closes the door and then turns around to find Judith on the staircase with her father's gun.

He explains he was whistling one of his favorite songs and writes it down for her in a book where she is documenting everything that happens to them for the future. When Luke suggests stopping at a nearby library along the way to look for more books, Judith convinces her mother to accept after complaining that she has already read almost every book back in Alexandria.

When the group heads inside the library, Judith finds a Russian-English dictionary she gives to Luke for Eugene to understand the satellite parts. As Michonne tells her daughter they can read a book together, she is called over the radio by Magna.

Morning Star

As the children climb into the wagon, Judith expresses a desire to stay and fight, but Daryl is quick to rebuff her. He then spots Carol and Ezekiel arriving, but doesn't go to greet them. The caravan doesn't make it far before they hit a roadblock and discover Felix and Penny (the scouts they sent earlier) dead. Daryl identifies this as one of Negan's tactics and concludes that all the other roads will be blocked, too, making a retreat impossible.

Daryl says that he knows she can, and apologizes for Judith seeing the bodies of Felix and Penny earlier that day. Judith dismisses them as "just walkers", which she has killed plenty of. Judith claims that she isn't scared, but when Daryl says that he might be, she says that she might be scared for R.J., her mom, and Daryl.

R.J. joins in on the call to say hello to his mother, but Judith tells him they need to use codenames for security, so R.J. chooses "Little Brave Man" as his codename, much to Michonne's delight. Michonne asks about Rosita, before switching the topic to the Whisperers. Judith informs her that the Whisperers are finished, as they eliminated most of the horde, while Alpha can't hurt them anymore. Michonne then reveals that she found something that belonged to the "Brave Man", and where he might have been recently. Choking back tears, Judith asks if Rick is still alive, but Michonne doesn't know. Judith then urges Michonne to go find Rick if she thinks he is alive. Michonne initially declines, reasoning that Judith and R.J. need her right now, but Judith is insistent, telling Michonne that Rick could be trying to come home and might need help. Michonne accepts her mission, and tells Judith that she will try her on the walkie for as long as she can. They then say their goodbyes.



"
The Tower
"


Judith is among the Alexandrians to relocate to the abandoned 
hospital
 being referred to as "the tower". Judith approaches Lydia, who is petting a cat. Judith offers condolences for her mother's death, but Lydia tells her she doesn't have to do that. When asked, Lydia denies that she misses her mother, and tells Judith that not everyone gets to have a mom like hers. As Judith leaves, Negan observes from a distance.

In the woods, Judith downs a lone walker, just as Daryl discovers her. When he finds out Judith is alone, he tries to take her back to the Tower, but Judith protests that she hates it at the building, as it smells of cat urine, and wants to learn to do what Daryl does instead. Although Daryl is initially resistant to this idea, he eventually agrees to let her tag along. Daryl explains that he is walking the perimeter and looking for anything out of the ordinary, and if he spots something, he retreats and radios it in. He warns Judith that there is no room for mistakes, which she acknowledges.

In the woods, Daryl coaches Judith to spot things that don't belong. She notices a piece of skin on the side of a tree, and correctly identifies this as coming from a walker. Daryl notes that the Whisperers could be rounding more walkers up, and instructs Judith to stay behind him. It isn't long before they come upon a small group of walkers, led by the same Whisperer Beta threatened earlier. Daryl shoots the Whisperer with his crossbow, injuring her. As the Whisperer runs off, Daryl and Judith dispatch the walkers and quickly give chase.

Judith and Daryl track down the 
injured Whisperer
 to a small ditch. The Whisperer begs Daryl to pull the arrow out of her shoulder, not wanting to die in that manner. Daryl orders her to drop the knife and asks where the rest of the Whisperers are. She quickly reveals their whereabouts, but also that she was going off on her own. When asked why, she claims to have had no choice, revealing that Beta lost his mind after the survivors killed Alpha. Finally, Daryl asks if the Whisperers know the survivors' location, but the Whisperer doesn't know, although she assures Daryl that Beta will keep coming for them. Daryl proceeds to aim his crossbow at the Whisperer's head, as the latter pleads that she wants to "walk after". Daryl repeats his previous question, but the Whisperer genuinely doesn't know. With that, Daryl shoots the Whisperer in the head. Shocked, Judith tells Daryl that he didn't have to kill the Whisperer, but Daryl rationalizes that she didn't have any information and was going to die anyway, so it was better for it to happen quickly. Judith protests leaving the Whisperer, and hypothesizes that she could have a family, but Daryl gently drags her away.

As they are heading back, Judith stops and once again expresses discomfort at them leaving the Whisperer in a ditch. She asks what would happen if Daryl was lost and no one could find him, or R.J., or her mom. When he asks where this is coming from, Judith states that she simply wishes for everyone to be back together again. Daryl assures her that he radioed Michonne and told her not to come, even though he didn't get a reply. Judith claims that it doesn't matter, as she talked to her mom after the fire, and is worried that Michonne might not come home. 

Daryl asks what Michonne said, but Judith just says that she went to help some people she met along the way. Judith didn't want to tell Daryl about this, as she was afraid that he'd leave, too. Daryl assures Judith that he won't leave, but refuses to promise anything, as he maintains that he can't lie to Judith, and doesn't know what's going to happen in the future, no more than anyone does. Daryl, however, goes on to state that there are a lot of people back at the Tower who would do anything for her, and will one day need her to do anything for them. Finally, Daryl assures Judith that, while nothing can take the place of a loved one lost, it doesn't mean that everything that follows is going to break your heart. He then embraces her.

"


Judith and the group are seen making it back to the Tower. At the exit, Daryl says goodbye to Judith through the separating door. Gabriel tells the other to go, as the Whisperers are smashing down the final barricade. Judith realizes Gabriel isn't coming, but he explains that someone needs to stay behind to keep the Whisperers from cutting the rope. When Judith asks if 
Rosita
 knows about this, he instructs her to tell her "Eres mi media naranja", claiming that she will know the meaning behind the phrase. With that, Judith and the others descend down the elevator shaft, leaving Gabriel to face the attacking Whisperers.

After the war is over, Judith spots 
Maggie
 as the rendezvous point and hugs her after being reunited for the first time in years.

She becomes caught up in the chaos when a herd of walkers breach and start attacking civilians, and is lost in the crowd and separated from Daryl. Judith watches in horror as she sees one walker eating a body before approaching her. However, Daryl shoots him with Rick's revolver. Judith asks for the gun, saying the civilians need their help. Daryl complies, drawing his knives, and tells her they work together. 

Judith comes across Sebastian Milton, who had been bitten by a walker on the neck. She puts that walker down by shooting it in the head as Sebastian chokes on his own blood before dying. Judith watches sadly next to Daryl as Sebastian's speech continues to play in the background on a loop.

"
Family
"


In a reclaimed 
Alexandria
, the 
Coalition
 recover their various weapons from a large crate full of weapons confiscated by 
the Commonwealth
. Recovering her 
katana
 and 
Rick
's 
Colt Python
, Judith muses about her family's fight for survival and a new beginning and the cost that comes with it. Judith recalls how she never got to know her mother 
Lori
, how 
Carl
 dreamed of a day when they'd all live in peace, how 
Michonne
 tried to hang up her sword and how Rick was searching for mercy. Judith looks at the Coalition charter that Michonne had written before putting it in her bag along with a drawing she had made as 
R.J.
 joins her. Judith keeps thinking about something that Michonne had told her, a secret saying that Michonne had used to share with Rick that was like a good luck charm, one that is for Judith and R.J. too. Recognizing that it was one of many things that she was afraid to say out loud, Judith muses that they didn't know when they started this, that this would be the day that everything changed forever. Judith gives her little brother her hat, the same way that Carl had passed it down to her before his death.

Ezekiel
 says goodbye to 
Nabila
, 
Aliyah
 and 
Gracie
 while 
Daryl
 promises R.J. that they will be back soon and orders him to look after Judith. However, Judith tells Daryl and 
Carol
 that she's coming too over Daryl's objections. Judith reminds her friends that this isn't the future that Carl wanted and it's not what Rick and Michonne fought for, not yet at least. What they're doing could help everyone, maybe everybody everywhere, not just them. Judith wants to be a part of making what her family believed in real. Carol recognizes that while everyone else has been focused on the present for a long time, Judith has been thinking about the future which is a good thing and something that they could all do a little more of. Daryl agrees on the condition that Judith stays right with him, and he leaves R.J. in Nabila's care while they're gone.

On the railroad tracks, the Commonwealth's train smashes a walker to bits. Inside, observed by Daryl, Carol, Maggie and Judith, Rosita pours over a map of the Commonwealth with Gabriel, telling him that once they get inside, they will move the former prisoners into hiding and, as they hopefully get Mercer on their side to take out Pamela, she and Gabriel will go to get 
Coco
 back. Gabriel notices that they're going in through the lower ward and wonders why they're not going in through 
the Estates
 instead. Rosita points out that with more money, the Estates have more patrols, meaning that they don't stand out as much in the lower wards. They're going to use an access road that will allow them to hit the children's home from behind. Gabriel smiles at Rosita and promises her that they will get Coco back which is his faith in Rosita talking and Rosita is glad that Gabriel is with her.

A concerned Judith tells Daryl and Carol that she hasn't heard from Michonne in a long time. While Judith had tried to reach her mother a few times, she was unsuccessful. Carol reassures Judith that there could be a lot of reasons for that and Michonne can take care of herself better than just about anyone that Carol knows. Daryl promises Judith that both Rick and Michonne would be very proud of their daughter. Judith asks if Carl would be proud of her too and Daryl nods while Carol tells Judith that she and Carl are a lot alike. Judith remembers that her brother had died saving people and she wishes that she'd had more time with Carl and that they have more time to just remember everyone that they've lost along the way. Carol promises that they will, and Daryl promises that, when this is over, he will tell Judith every story that he remembers about all of the people that loved her before pulling Judith into a hug.

Outside of the tunnel entrance, four Commonwealth soldiers patrol while the Coalition forces hide nearby. Negan tells the others that they are sitting ducks and Mercer isn't coming and they can't wait for him. Carol agrees that it's time for a new plan, but Princess is sure that Mercer is gonna show up. Daryl states that they're running out of time and Carol decides to head around and try to find another way to slip in. Maggie suggests that they could take the four guards, but Rosita warns her that if those guards go missing, the clock is going to start ticking on them. Judith draws the others attention as one of the guards notices something and starts heading their way. However, Lieutenant Rose calls in with orders from Mercer for the guards to report to the East Gate immediately to deal with the incoming herd. Lieutenant Rose confirms that that includes Tunnel H and he reassures the soldiers that the tunnel is locked, and they've got it covered on the other end. Complying with his orders, the guards move out. Breaking the lock on the door, the group makes their way into the tunnel.

The Coalition forces emerge from the tunnel in the seemingly-abandoned Union Station. Daryl quickly deduces that something isn't right, and he notices that the outer doors are all chained shut. Realizing that it's a trap, Daryl yells for everyone to get down as Pamela's private forces, situated on the station's balcony, open fire, killing Tyler and two former prisoners standing near him as everyone else dives for cover.

A gunfight erupts between Pamela's forces and the Coalition with Rosita desperately trying to get the doors open. One Alexandria resident crawls towards a hiding Connie, Kelly, Magna and Dianne, but he is shot in the head and killed by one of Pamela's men before he can reach them. As the gunfight continues, Pamela herself emerges and grabs a 
gun
 from one of her men who is killed by the Coalition. Pamela takes aim at Maggie, but Judith notices and shoves Maggie out of the way just in time, saving her life. Instead, Pamela accidentally shoots Judith, seriously wounding the young girl. Daryl desperately attends to Judith as Pamela watches in horror and the others increase their fire, killing a few more of Pamela's men. Yelling that 
"you did this,"
 Pamela retreats to her office. Looking for a way out, Daryl spots a 
fire extinguisher
 near Ezekiel and signals him to throw it. Grabbing Rick's Colt Python from Judith, Daryl shoots the fire extinguisher, creating a smokescreen.

In Union Square, Yumiko and Max observe the heavily guarded doors to Union Station from across the street. Hearing twigs snapping, Yumiko spots a hooded Eugene sneaking around a train car, armed with Brooks' rifle and she tells Max that they are going to go around. Inside, under cover of the smokescreen, Daryl and the others manage to break the chains sealing a side door. As a trooper approaches the doors, Eugene ambushes him and knocks the man out with the butt of his rifle. Magna finally breaks through the doors, and everyone is reunited with Eugene, Yumiko and Max before quickly making their escape.

The Coalition races through the streets towards the 
hospital
 with Daryl carrying the unconscious Judith. Commonwealth vehicles drive up and block their path in multiple directions, forcing them to fall back. Carol realizes that the soldiers aren't following them as they begin to erect barricades in the streets. Loudly yelling and firing their guns in the air, Commonwealth soldiers lead the herd in their direction before closing the barricades, penning the herd and the Coalition in. Spotting a walker climbing over something, a shocked Negan asks 
"what the fuck?"
 As walkers close in from multiple directions, Luke and Jules emerge from the herd, causing Kelly to nearly shoot them before Connie stops her sister. Fleeing down a side street, Carol spots an alley near part of the herd and everyone attacks the walkers, clearing a path for Daryl to flee down the alley towards the hospital with Judith. Waking up for a moment, Judith calls out 
"daddy?"
 and witnesses her friends and loved ones struggling to hold back the herd before passing out again.



"
Rest in Peace
"


Carrying the badly injured and half-conscious Judith, 
Daryl
 bursts into the 
Commonwealth Hospital
, desperately yelling for help. Daryl lays Judith down on a stretcher and continues looking for help as the dazed Judith witnesses two 
Commonwealth soldiers
 rushing by carrying a box of medicine. Encountering Daryl, the two men knock him unconscious and leave. Judith spots the 
herd
 approaching the hospital and stumbles to her feet and begins closing the still-open doors. Struggling against a walker, Judith manages to brace the doors shut with a desk before passing out on the floor next to Daryl.

Later, a bandaged and bruised Daryl regains consciousness in a bed with 
Carol
 at his side and 
Magna's group
 nearby desperately trying to save 
Luke
's life, having 
amputated
 his bitten leg. Getting to his feet against Carol's objections, Daryl checks on a pale and unconscious Judith who is lying on a nearby stretcher, noting with concern that Judith has lost a lot of blood. Looking at their friends' desperate attempts to save the dying Luke, Carol informs Daryl that all of the doctors, nurses and medicine are gone, taken by 
Pamela Milton
 to where she's holed up in 
the Estates
, leaving the rest of 
the Commonwealth
 to fend for itself. Daryl decides that they need to get to the Estates, but Carol informs him that there's too many soldiers and they're hoping to find somebody who can get them in without a fight. Daryl suggests that 
Mercer
 can help as he knows people on the inside and Carol tells him that Max thinks so too and that there's a team after him while some of the others are looking for the missing kids with everyone planning to meet back at the hospital. Daryl hates the idea of just waiting, but Carol corrects him that they're going to take care of Daryl and Judith while the others are gone.

Near death from the bite and blood loss, Luke has his friends remove a harmonica that he's kept from his pocket and Yumiko promises him that they'll keep the music alive for him. With his last words, Luke asks everyone to promise him, and they all do so. Luke dies in his friends' arms as they all sob at losing him. Taking a knife from Kelly, 
Magna
 stabs Luke in the head to prevent him from reanimating and the group sobs over his corpse. Watching the others' grief, a determined Daryl decides to give Judith a blood transfusion, explaining that he's a universal donor and that 
Merle
 had used to make him sell his blood when he was a kid as a way of making money. Carol helps Daryl set up the transfusion as they watch the others cover Luke's body in a sheet. Hearing loud noise and shouting, Carol and the others leave to sweep the hospital for walkers and to make sure that the others are okay while Daryl remains with Judith.

A confused Judith wakes up and panics that she's going to die when Daryl informs her that Judith's at the hospital. Daryl tries to reassure Judith, but she feels like she's going to die, worrying that 
"
Mom
's gonna find 
Dad
 and we're gonna be together. We're all gonna be together,"
 but at the moment it feels like she's going to die instead. Although visibly shocked by the implication that Rick's still alive, Daryl reassures Judith that she's going to be fine. Judith starts to quote something that Michonne had used to say to Rick, but she passes out again as banging and screaming sounds in the background. Reentering the room, Carol tells Daryl that walkers have breached the hospital and they have to go. As Daryl tries to wake Judith up, Rosita calls in with the news that her group is in the alley behind the hospital, but they wrecked their ambulance going through the herd which is now surrounded by walkers.

Daryl begins wheeling Judith's stretcher out, but stops after seeing walkers pounding on the glass at the front doors of the hospital. Disconnecting the blood transfusion, Daryl barricades Judith in the room and rushes to help in the lobby where walkers drag 
Adrienne
 outside and devour her while the group barricades the doors again. Looking at the numerous walkers outside of the windows, Carol and Daryl shocked to see a variant walker breaking the glass with a brick while Connie spots more walkers coming down the hallway from the other direction. The variant breaks through the glass and is immediately stabbed in the head by Carol, but more walkers break in from the other side and drag a man outside and devour him. With walkers converging from the three sides, the group attempts to fight them off, only to have more walkers break through the barricaded door as well. Racing down a clear hallway, the group grabs Judith's stretcher while Magna radios the others to warn them that the hospital has been breached and they're leaving out the back. The group races through the hospital towards an exit as walkers close in on them from multiple directions.

At night, outside of a loading dock, 
Mercer
 observes a crowd of desperate Commonwealth residents demanding to be let into the Estates. Mercer reassures 
Maggie
 that they will be able to move soon while 
Aaron
 tells 
Ezekiel
 that he saw people on the higher floors and rooftops begging for help, but he wanted to make sure that 
Lydia
 was safe first. Ezekiel reassures his friend that he did the right thing. Hearing screams in the distance, both men are determined to do more, but they need to take care of Judith first. Lieutenant 
Rose
 arrives in another truck and reports to Mercer that they're all set: everyone is in the back and there's no one to check. The doctors have set up a safe house, but they have to hurry. Mercer calls for everyone to go, stating that they need to get Judith to 
Tomi
. Everyone boards the truck with 
Princess
, 
Max
 and 
Dianne
 pushing Judith's stretcher.

At the safe house in the Estates, Daryl lays Judith on a bed and Tomi immediately begins tending to her. Tomi informs Daryl that Judith is in a fragile state, but he did a good thing by giving her blood. Tomi promises to do what he can and enlists Ezekiel's help. Ezekiel orders the others to clear the room, promising to get them when Judith is stable.

Her injured arm now in a sling, Judith wakes up as Daryl and Carol watch over her, much to their relief. Judith admits that she doesn't feel great, but she's fine like Daryl had promised her. Daryl asks if what Judith had said about Rick and Michonne was true, and Judith reveals that it's why Michonne had never returned. Daryl and Carol are stunned by this, and Judith apologizes for not telling them earlier, having been afraid that Daryl would leave too if he knew that Rick is still alive somewhere. Daryl reassures Judith that he's still there, before they are interrupted by shouts outside and two gunshots. Looking outside, Mercer sees a man trying to climb the wall, only to be shot by Commonwealth soldiers on Pamela's orders. Mercer tells the others that the soldiers are shooting anyone that climbs the gates and grabs a gun, unwilling to just stand by as people are dying. Mercer informs the Coalition members that the truck is gassed up with enough reserves in the rear to get them home. Mercer and his men can sneak them out the back as Mercer believes that this isn't their fight or their people. 
"Yes, they are. And so are you,"
 states Ezekiel. Addressing the others, Ezekiel tells them that 
"you may not think this place is worth saving, and I get that, given how they treated us. But it's worth it to me. The people are worth it, and I'm not gonna allow them to fall without a fight. Not today. I'm with you. Who else?"
 Aaron immediately agrees, stating that they can do more than just save themselves and they need to. Following Ezekiel's lead, everyone agrees to fight to save the Commonwealth.

At the gates of the Estates, the crowd desperately begs Pamela to be let in, amongst them 
Mr. Martens
, 
Mrs. Martens
 and 
Mei
. On a balcony, Maggie lines up her shot on Pamela, but Negan tells her to hold on as Mercer and his loyalist forces move in, ordering Colonel 
Vickers
 and her men to lower their weapons. Pamela orders Vickers to arrest them, but the Coalition forces join Mercer's troops from another angle, creating a standoff. Pamela accuses Mercer of being a traitor, but Mercer states that she's the true traitor and lists Pamela's crimes: disappearing hundreds of citizens, leading the dead to their doorstep, shooting a child and now leaving thousands to die.

The banging on the gates grows more frantic as the herd begins to approach the Estates, meaning that the people will die if they're not let inside. Gabriel moves towards the gates despite Vickers orders to stop. Gabriel announces that they're opening the gate and letting everyone inside, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him. Vickers threatens to shoot him, but Carol warns her that they will fire back if she does. Pamela orders her men to shoot Gabriel as he reaches the gates and one of them points a gun at his head. Suddenly, Daryl yells for them to stop. 
"What the hell you doing?"
 Daryl demands. 
"We all deserve better than this. You built this place to be like the old world. That was the fuckin' problem."
 Pamela states that if she opens the gates, the dead will get in too, not just the living. Daryl tells her that if she doesn't, Pamela will lose everything anyway. 
"We got one enemy. We ain't the walking dead."


Realizing that Daryl is right, Vickers orders everyone to lower their weapons and give Gabriel the key to the gates. Everyone stands down and Vickers defers to Mercer's command who places Pamela under arrest for high crimes against the people of the Commonwealth. As everyone rushes to help let the people in, Maggie informs Negan that Pamela is getting arrested and Negan tells her that prison is a fate worse than death for someone like Pamela, causing Maggie to relent in shooting her.

The crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in 
Alexandria
 and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified 
Lance Hornsby
, Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of 
suicide
. Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rife, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back.

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates.

Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

In Alexandria, everyone enjoys a celebration and feast, joined by Mercer, Max and Tomi. Judith gives 
Dog
 some of her food and Yumiko raises a toast to Luke. Looking out the window, Daryl sees Negan walking away and the two men exchange a smile and a nod, parting on good terms. Yumiko turns to Magna, telling her 
"same"
 and Magna kisses her, the two women resuming their romantic relationship. Sitting down, 
Rosita
 smiles as she watches the celebration before becoming somber. Noticing Rosita's somber mood, 
Gabriel
 joins her, and Rosita tells him that she just wants to remember this perfect moment. In a whisper, Rosita reveals her bite and impending death to Gabriel. Noticing Rosita's behavior and crying, Judith realizes that something's wrong with her and becomes upset, apparently deducing the truth.

A year later, at Ezekiel's speech as the new governor of the Commonwealth, Judith spots Elijah and Lydia and greets her friends who now work as couriers for the combined communities while continuing to date each other. Lydia, who has a prosthetic left arm now, hands Judith a package that she says is supposed to be a surprise before she and Elijah walk off together. Inside, Judith finds her old compass that she had 
given to Negan
 and a letter from 
Negan
 reading 
"Judith, this has always helped me find my way. I'm returning it to you now in the hope that it can guide you to your dreams. Thank you for letting me use it."


In Alexandria, Daryl and Carol, who is now wearing her hair short again as she did before Rick's disappearance, look at the old memorial wall of the people that the community had lost. Alexandria has been fully rebuilt and is thriving again with the residents enjoying everyday life together. Aaron, Gabriel, Coco, and 
Gracie
 greet Lydia, Elijah, Judith and 
R.J.
 and Lydia gives Gabriel a package from Father 
Grant
 and his 
old congregation
. Daryl and Carol join them while Jerry and 
Nabila
, walking through town as their daughters play outside, smile at them. Aaron admits that he never thought that they'd get back to any of this, although he had hope. Aaron calls them all very lucky, but Gabriel corrects Aaron that it's effort rather than luck. They have a lot to be proud of in their family, community, and future.

The group from the Commonwealth next visits a rebuilt and thriving 
Hilltop
 where Maggie and Hershel watch as Adam plays. Carol asks Maggie what she had wanted to talk about, and Maggie reveals that she wants to talk about the future. 
"There's a lot out there to find out about. And I think it's time we did."


At the side of the road, Judith, R.J. and Ezekiel join Daryl and Carol as he prepares to depart on his motorcycle. Daryl hugs the kids and R.J. promises him that he will be good while Judith promises to keep an eye on Dog for him. Daryl asks Judith to keep an eye on Carol and promises her that if he sees or hears anything about Rick and Michonne while he's out there, he will find them both and bring them home. Calling him Uncle Daryl, Judith states that Daryl deserves a happy ending too and Daryl promises to come back. Daryl hugs Ezekiel goodbye and he leads the kids to the top of the wall to watch Daryl's departure. Daryl and Carol hug and admit that they love each other before Daryl drives off on his motorcycle through the Commonwealth gate, setting off through the countryside on his new journey.

Looking out over the fields of the Commonwealth, Judith tells her brother that 
"we get to start over. We're the ones who live."

"
The Last Time
"


As Judith sits on the steps of a house wearing Rick's old 
Colt Python
 and her 
katana
, she hears her mother's voice come through her radio and picks it up.

In a field nearby, Rick and Michonne emerge from the helicopter and rush to greet their children, having finally returned home, although Rick hesitates briefly after having been away for so long and missed so much of Judith and R.J.'s lives. Sobbing, Judith hugs her father, telling Rick that she knew that he was still out there, 
"I just never wanted you to feel alone".
 Rick admits that he thought that he was, before realizing that he wasn't. Judith tells Michonne that she got her back and Michonne reminds her daughter that Judith told her to. Meeting his father for the first time, R.J. asks if he's the Brave Man which Rick and Michonne confirm. Touching R.J.'s 
hat
, which had once been Rick's before he'd passed it down to his children, Rick tells his son to call him Dad. R.J. states that he knew that Rick would come back, that he believed it. Rick and R.J. hug for the first time which turns into a group hug of the reunited Grimes family as CRM helicopters fly overhead, carrying supplies to help other communities in need.

Trivia
[
]


Robert Kirkman
 stated: "If you've watched this show, it's definitely much more likely that it is Shane's baby, but you never really know."
[2]


Andrew Lincoln
 in a 2018 interview even claimed that Judith is not Rick's biological daughter but that he considers her his own.

Even further this is confirmed on the show during Rick's dream as 
Shane
 asks Rick "How's my little baby girl doing?"


As of Carl's death in "
Honor
", Judith has no known surviving blood relatives.


Judith is the first of thirteen known children in the TV Series to be born into the apocalypse, the others being two unnamed infants living at the 
Kingdom
, her best friend 
Gracie
, 
Hershel Rhee
, her brother 
R.J.
, 
Ezra
, 
Aliyah
, 
Mariam
, 
Adam Sutton
, 
Socorro Espinosa
, 
Celeste
, and 
Rosie Porter
.

Out of them, Judith is the only one whose birth was shown on screen.


Judith is, so far, one of the only seven known characters to be played by several different actors and actresses, the others being 
Michonne
, 
Hannah
, 
Mike
, 
Terry
, 
Paula
 and 
Hershel
.

However, she's the only one to be portrayed by multiple actresses at the same time.


On 
Talking Dead
, it is revealed Judith has 6 different sets of twin actors, plus a stunt doll for when the scenes were considered too unsafe for her actress.


As of "
What Comes After
", Judith has been portrayed by 8 different sets of twin actors and 2 child actresses. This means she has 18 actors, the most of any character. The last set of twins, 
Chloe & Sophia Garcia-Frizzi
, are the first ones to make it an entire season.


She is the youngest character to have killed someone, in this case 
Lori Grimes
, at the age of barely a few seconds old; albeit indirectly caused.


Judith is the first recurring female character in the TV Series to both appear in and survive three or more seasons without ever being added to the main cast.


Judith's first word was said in "
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
", being "Mama".


After the death of 
Sasha
, Judith is the only character introduced in 
Season 3
 to not die in the 
TV Series
.


As of the episode "
Honor
", she is the current owner of 
Rick's hat
, following the death of her half-brother 
Carl Grimes
.


As of the episode "
What Comes After
", she is the current owner of 
Rick Grimes
' 
Colt Python
 revolver.

Aside from a Colt Python, Judith also uses a 
Katana
 as a weapon of choice.


Judith sees members of Rick's group as family members to her, such as seeing 
Maggie
, 
Carol
 and 
Rosita
 as her "aunts" while 
Daryl
 and 
Aaron
 as her "uncles".


Judith is one of two characters, the other being 
Paula
, who has been portrayed by more than one actress in the same episode. In this case, the episodes were "
Mercy
", where she was portrayed by 
Kinsley Isla Dillon
 and 
Chloe & Sophia Garcia-Frizzi
, and "
What Comes After
" and "
Scars
", where she was portrayed by 
Cailey Fleming
 and Chloe & Sophia Garcia-Frizzi.


Judith and R.J. are the first adoptive siblings to appear in the 
TV Series
.


Judith is seventh most-appearing character on the TV Series, having appeared in 88 episodes so far.


Judith is the fifth main character to outlive her comic book 
counterpart
, with the first being 
Shane Walsh
, second being 
Carol Peletier
, the third being 
Tyreese Williams
, the fourth being 
Beth Greene
, the sixth being 
Morgan Jones
, the seventh being 
Abraham Ford
, the eighth being 
Rosita Espinosa
, the ninth being 
Ezekiel Sutton
, the tenth being 
Alpha
 and the eleventh being 
Gabriel Stokes
.


Judith shares many similarities with 
Clementine
 from 
The Telltale Series
:

Both are/were nine years old during the apocalypse.


Both lost their parents (Judith's 
biological father
 was killed by her future 
adoptive father
 while her 
biological mother
 passed away during her birth; Clementine's parents died in Savannah, Georgia shortly after the outbreak).


Both were mature far beyond their years.


Both were efficient in using firearms at a young age.


Both owned walkie-talkies to talk to their loved ones.


Both killed their first human in an act of self-defense and were emotionally affected by it (Judith killed a 
Whisperer
 during the 
assault
 on the 
Hilltop
 while Clementine killed the 
Stranger
 
(Determinant)
 to protect herself and 
Lee
).


Both were deeply traumatized when they had to put someone they knew out of their misery (Judith killed 
Earl Sutton
 after he turned while Clementine killed Lee 
(Determinant)
 to prevent reanimation).


Both kept their father's former hat in a way to honor them.


Both are/were taking care of a young boys named after fathers: Judith takes care of her adoptive brother named 
Rick Jr.
 (R.J. for short) when Clementine was taking care of a boy named 
Alvin Jr.
 (A.J. for short). Also both R.J. and A.J. look alike and have many similarities.


Both were shot in the left shoulder.
