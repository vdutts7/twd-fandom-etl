, drawn to the Commonwealth on 
Pamela Milton
's orders, arrives at the gate. Livits demands to know where his and the other guards' backup is as they need every available trooper at the East Gate immediately. Livits is shocked to see a zombie climbing the walls and calls a warning into his radio before shooting it in the head only to see more climb. However, Livits fails to see a zombie climbing up behind him as he desperately calls for backup. Livits turns around as the climber grabs him, removes his helmet and bites into his cheek. In the struggle, Livits accidentally hits the gate controls, opening the East Gate and allowing the massive herd into the Commonwealth. As the other two guards flee, a second climber joins Livits' attacker in devouring him.
