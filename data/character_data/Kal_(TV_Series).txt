Justin
 stumbling onto the road.

When they arrive at the work camp and inform everyone of Justin's death, Kal watches as the Saviors become furious and start accusing

Later that day, a small herd of walkers approaches the group. They get in position and remind themselves to watch for the Whisperers.

"
The Calm Before
"


Kal watches from the crowd as Ezekiel declares they've finally accomplished Rick, Carl, and Jesus' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds.

Later that day, Kal and a group prepare to leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. He then fist bumps Tara goodbye and leaves with a group. In the woods, Kal and the rest encounter 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and 
D.J.

The next day, Kal listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news about the fate of the missing fair attendees, tells them how brave the victims were in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story.

"
Walk With Us
"


The Hilltop Colony was attacked by the Whisperers with their weaponized horde and flaming arrows, the latter of which caused the fire that quickly engulfed the settlement. It is unknown what happened to Kal as the zombies continued to push into the burning Hilltop, as he was not seen among the several survivor groups to escape Hilltop, and was never seen at any point afterwards again. However, it's also possible that Kal wasn't present at the Hilltop during the attack, as he was last seen months prior at the fair, and hasn't been seen since, giving Kal an opportunity of time were he may have left the Hilltop Colony.
