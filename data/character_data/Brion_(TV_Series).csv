,,,"Brion is described as an educated, pokerfaced leader who has a superior air and does not let his motives be known. He is one of the most high-ranking members of the 
Scavengers
 and is extremely loyal to 
Jadis
. He generally has a very creepy and sinister vibe to him, as he rarely speaks and never shows any emotion. Brion's actor, 
Thomas Francis Murphy
, describes Brion as an intelligent and observant man, who tries to be useful in any situation possible. Later, Brion and his people betray 
Rick
's group, showing he can be quite cunning and ruthless. When Rick attempts to get the Scavengers to join their side again, Brion is extremely distrusting towards him. Though later they do help Rick attack the 
Sanctuary
, this ends up costing his life when 
Simon
 gets revenge by killing him and the rest of the Scavengers. Jadis is the only one who survives, and she is shown to be devastated by her people's deaths, especially Brion. When she sees his zombified self walking towards her, she looks at him with sadness before he is put down.",Nothing is known about Brion's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, Brion somehow came into contact with a group called ""the Scavengers"" which he subsequently joined before becoming a lieutenant. They survived by making homemade weapons from junk and scavenging the nearby areas for supplies.
Brion was present when Jadis made a deal with an 
unknown group
 in possession of a helicopter in exchange for supplies. Throughout the following months, he and his fellow Scavengers would kidnap people, marking them as an 
""A"" or ""B""
, and then deliver them to the helicopter to be taken to an unknown location and to an unknown fate.
Brion is among the Scavengers to round up 
Rick Grimes
 and his group at the junkyard when they arrive looking for their missing 
companion
. When Rick asks for her help against the Saviors, Jadis tells Rick that he needs to prove his worth, and then pushes him down the trash heap. After defeating the walker covered in spiked armor, Brion and the Scavengers agree to help fight the Saviors in exchange for goods and more guns as payment. Before Rick's group leaves the junkyard, Brion reminds them not to take long or else.
Brion observes the 63 guns Rick and 
Michonne
 found at an overrun refugee camp and watches Rick and 
Jadis
 negotiate over the guns and being ready to fight.
Brion and the Scavengers arrive at Alexandria in a caravan of garbage trucks and bicycles. Later that day, Brion alerts everyone that the Saviors are coming. When Rick gives Rosita the signal to detonate the explosives to destroy 
Negan Smith
's caravan, they discover that the Scavengers had deactivated the explosives. Before Rick can reach for his gun, Jadis leaps up and aims her gun at Rick. Simultaneously, the Scavengers all turn their guns on the Alexandrians.
After Negan is attacked by a zombified 
Sasha
, the Alexandrians take their chance and attack the Scavengers and Saviors. Brion joins the fight with the Saviors. After 
the Kingdom
 and the 
Hilltop
 arrive and join the fight and many Scavengers are gunned down, Brion and Jadis release smoke bombs and escape in the haze with the remaining Scavengers, scaling the walls and running out the gate on foot.
Brion is among the group of Scavengers surrounding Rick as he attempts to persuade 
Jadis
 and everyone else to abandon Negan and join the winning side in the war against the Saviors. However, Brion shows his full distrust of Rick and his plan and watches as he is taken to a container.
After Rick overcomes a walker and finally convinces Jadis to join his side, Brion is among the Scavengers that travel to the Sanctuary to validate Rick's claim that it is surrounded by a herd.
Upon arriving at the Sanctuary and finding it empty from walkers, Brion is shocked to find that the Sanctuary wasn't depicted as shown in the photographs provided by Rick. When the Saviors start shooting at the Scavengers, Brion retreats with Jadis and the others.
Brion watches with 
Tamiel
 and the other Scavengers as 
Simon
 addresses the crowd and demands an apology from Jadis for her attempts to attack the Saviors. Dissatisfied with her first attempt, Simon shoots Brion in the chest, killing him. After the rest of the Scavengers are massacred, Brion eventually reanimates. Later that day, he is among the zombified Scavengers lured by Jadis to a metal crushing machine where he steps into the machine and is pulverized to a pulp.","Killed By
Negan Smith
 
(Indirectly Caused)
Negan orders Simon and his men to go to confront the Scavengers and take their weapons and kill one in order to get the others in line.
Simon
 
(Alive)
After taking all the Scavengers' guns, Simon attempts to get an apology from Anne to no avail. As a result, Simon kills Brion with a shot to the chest, followed by Tamiel and ultimately the rest of the Scavengers.

After Rick and Michonne leave her behind, Anne leads all of the zombified Scavengers up a hill and into a metal grinder, crushing them into pulp. Amongst them is Brion, who Anne watches get crushed sadly.","This list shows the victims Brion has killed:
Possibly numerous counts of 
zombies
 and unnamed people",,,"For more images of Brion, please visit

.","In an interview with Thomas Francis Murphy, he describes the character of Brion as 
""an underachiever in the days prior to the outbreak. He is an intelligent guy but was reluctant to put his intelligence into direct competition with others around him. He was under utilized. As awful as this new world order is there is within it an opportunity to come into himself in a new way. It, too, is something of a blank slate. He is an observer. A reader. He likes to know how things work and he can be very flexible in how he chooses to respond to a given set of circumstances. He is a bit of a tinkerer. Whatever the circumstance, he believes anyone's duty is first and foremost to make themselves useful. He places clarity above passion. He likes to be of use to people who think dispassionately. He sees those qualities in abundance in Jadis. Even when he is uncertain of her thinking he doesn't waiver in his allegiance and faith in her direction. He has a close working relationship with Jadis but it is not in his nature or experience to presume much on account of it.""
