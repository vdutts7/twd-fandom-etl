Overview
[
]


Crowley is brutal, reckless, and one of the 
Governor
's most trusted soldiers. It is said that he wasn't raised with much discipline growing up. He takes part in the Governor's killing of National Guard. He takes humor in 
Michonne
's "biter gram", only for him to be decapitated by Michonne moments later.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Very little is known about Crowley's life prior to or as the outbreak began. Crowley had some sort of quasi-military training and grew up in the woods of Georgia, spending his time hunting and with firearms, and did not have much discipline.
[1]




Post-Apocalypse
[

Season 3
[
]


"
Walk With Me
"
[
]


Crowley was first seen at the helicopter crash site with 
the Governor
, 
Merle Dixon
, 
Tim
, 
Martinez
 and 
Shumpert
. He exited the jeeps once they arrived and was seen wielding an assault rifle. He began investigating the area, searching for walkers. When Merle discovered 
Andrea Harrison
 and 
Michonne Hawthorne
, the group returned to Woodbury. While there, Andrea and Michonne were locked into a room by the Governor and carefully guarded by Crowley and Shumpert. Crowley was not seen again until the next day when 
Lieutenant Welles
 revealed where his 
U.S. Military
 allies had been holding up. The Governor, Shumpert, Tim, Martinez, Merle, and Crowley arrived at the location and eliminated every National Guard soldier present. Afterwards, Crowley was seen with Tim, Caesar, and Shumpert standing behind the Governor, before taking the armored vehicles, medicine, food, and other supplies. They eventually returned to Woodbury.

Crowley assisted Merle Dixon, Tim, and 
Gargulio
 during a search party in pursuit of Michonne. Michonne abruptly revealed her position to the group, decapitating Crowley, and stabbing Tim. Moments after, Merle ordered Gargulio¬†to stab Crowley's head before reanimation. Gargulio hesitated, but finally went through with the deed.
