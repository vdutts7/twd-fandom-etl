“


You know I used to be married once. (…) Well, not legally, but yeah. I guess I don't really talk about it much anymore. Yeah, 
Eric
 and I, we met in 
D.C.
, and there was just this instant connection, you know, and he asked me out that night. And I said no, and I kept saying no for the next six months. (…) I guess I thought I was too busy or that I wasn't ready. Maybe I was just afraid. But eventually I said yes, and our time together, those years in Alexandria... it was the happiest moments of my life. You know, after he died, I thought I'd give anything to take back just one of those no's so that we could have one more day together. Lydia, loss is inevitable. It always has been. The only thing we can control is when we say yes.

Overview
[
]


Aaron is described as "an affable, good-natured, adventurous guy. Despite feeling like a bit of an outsider for most of his life, he's passionate about people and the good they can do. He doesn't think twice about putting himself in danger if he believes something positive can come from it."

Aaron had been mistreated and ostracized most of his life, mostly due to him being openly gay and the reaction of people's homophobia, including abuse from his own mother. Despite this, Aaron consistently saw the good in people even though they were acting offensive. He has a good judge of character. Aaron is very altruistic and always wanted to help others, leading him to join a NGO and give supplies to those residing in the Niger River Delta.

Alongside his charitable personality, Aaron also has a sense of humor and optimism. He aims to keep people at ease with him. Sometimes his humor goes over people's heads, but he still aims for them to see the brighter side of things as he does. Aaron was supportive of Daryl's status as an outsider as well as comforting Maggie when Glenn disappeared. One of the things he enjoys doing is photography and collecting memorabilia from the places he had visited. After the apocalypse, he began collecting license plates from each state to create a mural on a wall in his house.

Aaron extremely loves and cares for 
Eric
, his husband. Both had been outsiders, treated with bigotry, and were the only people in the world who understood each other. Both worked together in recruiting outsiders for Alexandria as well as collecting license plates for their collection. Aaron is willing to tolerate many things, but one thing he can't tolerate is Eric being threatened or harmed in any way. He would even result to violence, something he is usually against, if it meant defending Eric, including putting himself in danger.

After Aaron brought 
Rick Grimes
' group into Alexandria, he and Eric grew a close bond to one of the group members, 
Daryl Dixon
. Aaron saw that, like himself and Eric, Daryl was an outsider to both his own group and Alexandria and that people fear him even though they do not know him. Because of Eric's near-death experience, Aaron had him retire and gave the position to Daryl so that Eric could stay safe and that Daryl could get out more and be himself. Aaron's affection gave Daryl purpose and was willing to sacrifice himself for Aaron's safety so that he could be safe if nothing else.

During the 
seventh season
, despite Eric being against Rick's plan to rebel against the Saviors, considering it to be too risky and there could be a lot of victims from this conflict, Aaron believes in Rick and his will for freedom and argues that in order to ensure their freedom they must fight, even if there will be victims, as the war will be the only way to build their future.

After Eric dies during the war with 
Negan
 and 
the Saviors
, Aaron becomes deeply depressed, as he was the only person Aaron had ever cared so much about. He becomes even more willing to do anything in order to put an end to the war forever. He and 
Enid
 then ask the community of 
Oceanside
 to aid them in finishing the war with the Saviors once and for all. The negotiations are hard, but Aaron finally convinces the Oceanside citizens to join the fight, which results in the victory for the Survivors against the war with the Saviors.   

After the war, Aaron starts training with Jesus to become a stronger fighter and takes a more proactive role in the community, including becoming a council member for Alexandria. When conflict with the Whisperers increases, Aaron becomes more cautious and less willing to take risks or let more people into the community. Despite any adversity, Aaron still clings to his humanity and tries to be the "nice guy", something he grows tired of as the Whisperer war continues.



Pre-Apocalypse

Vermont
[
]


Aaron was born and raised in Vermont. Aaron had a younger brother and spent their childhood together riding on bicycles around the neighborhood. His brother had a fascination with cars and, like Aaron, enjoyed being with other people. Growing up openly gay, Aaron's mother forced him to eat foods he didn't like; such as applesauce, salmon patties, and onions; to "make [him] more manly". Aaron viewed his mother as a "very confused woman who tried her damnedest".

Aaron attended college and fell in love with a man during his education. The summer after he graduated, he and his boyfriend traveled to Eureka, California and hiked in the woods nearby. They found themselves in the middle of Native American ruins where Aaron reflected on what life was like for the Natives and their hopes for the future. Sometime later, Aaron and his boyfriend separated.



Washington, D.C.
[
]


Despite the abuse and bigotry he endured, Aaron still believed in doing the right thing. With his passion for people and the good they can do, Aaron began a career in politics to provide for and encourage others to make the world a better place. Aaron moved to Washington, D.C. and became a politician. After working in the political circuit, Aaron felt that he was not affecting change. He realized he could do his best work abroad in a hands-on approach that would utilize his skill set. 

Hoping to interact with people and provide for them, Aaron joined a humanitarian group and later became employed under a non-government organization tasked with giving supplies and food to people in the Niger River Delta. While working in the NGO, Aaron often encountered Nigerian warlords and violent militias while in his field and had to negotiate with them.

Through working in the NGO, Aaron met 
Eric Raleigh
 in D.C. Upon their first meeting, Eric asked Aaron out that night and Aaron declined, but the two became friends and worked together. Eric knew how to handle the terrain due to being raised in the Appalachia's. Eric continued to ask Aaron out for the next six months until eventually Aaron said yes. On their fifth date, Aaron told Eric he loved him, to which Eric responded: "I had a hunch." After years together, Aaron and Eric considered themselves married despite gay marriage not being legal.



Post-Apocalypse

Alexandria, Virginia
[
]


Aaron and Eric were living in Washington, D.C. when the 
Wildfire Virus
 went 
global
 in August 2010. During 
the fall
, Aaron's younger brother died, affecting him greatly. Due to working in the political circuit, Aaron and Eric were among the first people evacuated from D.C. and brought to a suburban community in Alexandria, Virginia that was converted into a 
military safe zone
 for politicians in the area. Two weeks later, however, the military abandoned the safe zone due to 
Operation Cobalt
. Among others evacuated to Alexandria were Ohio Congresswoman 
Deanna Monroe
 and her family. Aaron and Eric remained with the Monroe family as they saw promise with the safe zone.

Eventually, walls were built around the area and a community was formed. The community had Deanna as its established leader. She believed that who people were before the fall mattered in rebuilding and sustaining the community. Because of Aaron and Eric's work in the NGO, their charitable nature, and ability to travel in dangerous terrain, it made them assets in the recruiting program designed to bring in more survivors. Aaron and Eric were tasked with finding survivors and monitoring them for several days to see if they were eligible for the community. Aaron would then approach the survivors with an offer, Eric being his guard, and bringing the survivors back to the safe zone to "audition" for citizenship.  

In their spare time, Aaron and Eric began a hobby of collecting license plates from abandoned cars from each state, making a mural of all fifty states in their home, in honor of his younger brother's love for cars. They also collected other vintage items to decorate in their home. In order to convince survivors to join the safe zone, Aaron took up photography and took pictures of the community as evidence. Back at the safe zone, despite rescuing a majority of the members there, the community still treated Aaron and Eric as outsiders because of their intolerance towards homosexuality, causing Aaron and Eric to avoid any gatherings and events of the community for fear of public ostracism in front of Deanna.

At one point, Aaron and Eric recruited a man named 
Davidson
, who was the leader of a small group, but they could not reside peacefully in the community. Deanna exiled them and had Aaron, a supply runner named 
Nicholas
, and her son 
Aiden
 drive them out. The recruiting for larger groups was suspended, focusing on lone survivors. This occurred for several months until Deanna realized that in order for the community and its members to survive, they would need more people who have been out there longer to teach them how to handle the new world. Aaron started to look for larger groups with Eric. At one point, Aaron encountered two people who sought to kill him, forcing him to kill them. 

Aaron observed 
Rick Grimes
 and his group as they traveled to Washington, D.C. in hopes of finding other survivors. Aaron left bottles of water for them on their path as a test, but the group declined to drink from it, fearing it may be poisoned. When a storm emerges, group member 
Daryl Dixon
 informed the group of a barn he'd seen earlier and lead the group there to safety. This quick-thinking act to keep his people alive convinced Aaron that they needed to be brought back to Alexandria. The following morning, upon seeing that the group had survived the storm and the walker attack, Aaron had Eric remain nearby and watch in case anything happened to him as he approached the group.

Aaron saw 
Sasha Williams
 and 
Maggie Greene
 exit the barn together and go to an open field alone to watch the sunrise. Using this opportunity, Aaron appears from the woods and carefully approaches the women. He comes off as friendly and cautious greeting the pair, though they aim their guns at him, which he understands as "stranger danger", and asks to speak with their leader, knowing his name to be Rick, before informing them that he has good news.



"
The Distance
"


Aaron revealed to Maggie and Sasha that he has a community not far from their location, and that it's been looking into recruiting surviving outsiders to help maintain their community. Maggie and Sasha bring Aaron to the barn where the rest of their group is. They have taken all his possessions away beforehand. Aaron wants them to come back to his community with him. 
Rick Grimes
, the leader whom Aaron has been monitoring, chooses not to believe him, and tells the group that Aaron has another agenda. Aaron shows them a small set of photographs of his community which he had taken as evidence of its existence. As Aaron is explaining what his community is about and emphasizing on its security, Rick punches him in the face, knocking him out. After he wakes up having his hands tied behind his back, Aaron remains positive towards the group, complimenting Rick's strength.

Rick asks Aaron about the number of people waiting for him and his group. Aaron responds saying how it does not matter whether he informed him of how many, as it would not affect whether or not he would trust him any more than he does then informs him that there is only one. Aaron also reveals that he and his accomplice have vehicles that they had tried to bring closer to the barn, but had been blocked by the trees. Rick allows 
Abraham Ford
, 
Rosita Espinosa
, 
Glenn Rhee
, 
Maggie Greene
, and 
Michonne Hawthorne
 go check out the vehicles, whilst everyone but Rick, who elects himself to stand guard over Aaron and watches his own 
daughter
, scours the area in groups of two to search for anyone else who might be watching. The groups leave, Rick warns Aaron that if his people do not return in one hour, he would kill him. When Judith starts crying, Aaron offers Rick some of the applesauce in his bag. Rick force feeds it to Aaron before Judith to ensure it is not poisoned, then cautiously tries it himself before allowing Judith to have some. When everyone returns with the food from Aaron's vehicles, Aaron again tries to persuade them to leave for his community, which Michonne persuades the others to do. He gives them instructions of a clear route, but Rick decides to take an uncleared route at night to stay hidden from any of Aaron's friends.

Hands tied behind his back, Aaron rides in a car with Michonne, Glenn and Rick to his community. When showing Michonne the pictures from his community, she wonders where the pictures of his people are and grows concerned. She asks him Rick's three questions, in which Aaron reveals he has previously killed a lot of walkers and two people who had tried to kill him first. After the group runs into numerous walkers, the car eventually crashes and stalls due to walker parts in the engine. When a lit flare is seen from afar, Aaron starts to panic, concerned of his partner's safety. He frantically requests for his freedom, but after the group denies him, he starts to become violent, kicking the door open and knocking Michonne over, running off into the forest. The others follow him, with Glenn saving his life when a walker attacks him. Glenn tells him that he can leave if he wants to, but Aaron says that he would prefer if Rick and his group would come with him to safety.

They then save Rick and Michonne from a group of walkers attacking them after Glenn untied Aaron and gave him a weapon to defend himself with. When they arrive at where the flare was fired, they reunite with the rest of the group. Aaron, worried Eric might be injured or even dead, runs inside the garage to find Eric alive but with a broken ankle. The two share an emotional reunion, with Eric surprising Aaron with another license plate, only to have Aaron reveal that he lost them all. Aaron then thanks the rest of the group for saving Eric and tells them they'll leave in the morning. Rick tries to keep him from sleeping next to Eric so that they could not conspire together, but Aaron announces that the only way they would keep him from sleeping alongside Eric was if they were to shoot him.

In the morning, Aaron is in the RV watching over Eric. He tells 
Noah
 that at his community, there is a surgeon named 
Pete
 who could try to fix his leg. He is then seen exiting the RV when they reach the safe zone, leading the way in and helping his husband to the infirmary.



"
Remember
"


Aaron leads the group into 
Alexandria
 while carrying Eric inside. After letting Eric go off to the infirmary, he stays at the gate with 
Nicholas
 as the group enters. Aaron asks that group comply with Nicholas' orders to turn over their weapons, and that they will need to speak to the leader, Deanna. After she spoke with Rick, Aaron guided Rick and Carl to the two vacant houses in the safe zone, and that he and Eric will be four houses down if Rick or anyone else needs anything.



"
Forget
"


From the time Aaron and Eric have been home since recruiting the Survivors, he wished for Eric to be retired considering his injury and near-death experience. As for his replacement, Aaron saw fit that Daryl would make an exceptional recruiter, and had Deanna hold off on giving Daryl a role in the community as he needed to observe him more. As he watched him, Aaron knew that Daryl was an outsider to both the safe zone as well as his own group, much like Aaron.

Aaron goes out of the safe zone to follow Daryl on one of his hunts and follows him, under the guise of hunting rabbits. When Daryl spots Aaron, he questions Daryl if he can really tell the difference between a good guy and a bad guy. Aaron then joins Daryl on the hunt, during which they come across a wild horse that children of the community have dubbed "
Buttons
" and Aaron and Eric have been trying to wrangle for months. When Daryl attempts to get Buttons, they are attacked by walkers and flee the area.

Aaron then reveals that he knows how Daryl feels, like an outsider. He goes on to explain how before and even now back at the safe zone, he and Eric are seen as outsiders because of people's homophobia. Aaron mentions that people fear what they don't understand and that Daryl should join the safe zone's welcoming party. Soon after, Aaron is attacked by walkers and Daryl rescues him. They come to find Buttons being devoured by walkers, so both Aaron and Daryl kill the walkers, with Aaron shooting Buttons out of its misery.

Aaron goes back to the safe zone with Daryl but doesn't attend the party so that he can help mend Eric's broken ankle. When Daryl arrives to the Monroe house but declines to go inside, Aaron invites Daryl over for spaghetti dinner. Aaron and Eric then surprise Daryl with a motorcycle and reveal that Eric is retiring and Daryl is to take his place, as Aaron saw that Daryl could handle himself out there, is in need of a friend who understands him, and that like Aaron and Eric he knows the difference between a good and a bad person. Daryl is grateful and forms a friendship with Aaron and Eric.



"

"


Aaron can be seen in his car, behind Daryl. The two of them are going on a mission to find new recruits.



"
Try
"


Aaron and Daryl are out in the night during their reconnaissance mission when they see something a light off in the distance. They go to investigate it. The next day, while still out in the woods, they find a body ripped apart on the ground and then a walker bound to the trunk of a tree with a 'W' on her forehead. Daryl kills her when she reanimates before they keep moving.



"
Conquer
"


Aaron and Daryl still continue their recruiting mission. The two are following a man with a poncho, smearing mud all over his face. Aaron asks Daryl what the man is doing and Daryl tells him the man knows how to keep the bugs off his body by using the mud. The two continue following the man until they soon lose track of him and come across a seemingly abandoned building with large trucks on the parking lot. The building is gated. Aaron explains to Daryl that they need more food for the people at Alexandria. The two then begin to kill the walkers that are near the place by drawing them to the gates. Finished, they opened the gate, and Aaron is thrilled to have finally find another plate number he has been searching for many times before. One of the trucks of food is locked, so Daryl opens it up, only to be shocked by a stream of walkers swarming from each of the truck, which each were unlocked by Daryl's opening. The walkers close their attention to the two of them, filling the once-empty parking field as they try to reach both him and Daryl. The two are forced to get into a car. As they are searching for a thing to cover up the windows so that the walkers might lose interest by not being able to see food, Daryl finds a note from someone who was trapped in the car before; the note reads: "Don't Stay, Bad People Coming".

Upon finding the note, Daryl and Aaron engage in conversation. Aaron tells Daryl that he knows that Rick and his group were good people, after he saw Daryl telling his group about the barn the night of the storm he had found when he had been alienating himself from the group. Daryl tells Aaron to stay put while he tries to run to the gate and then make a run for it when it was clear, suggesting he sacrifice himself for Aaron, and Aaron refuses to leave him and insists that he will go with Daryl. Daryl gives him a smile and Aaron smiles back. Just a second before the two open the doors, they are rescued by a mysterious survivor, who beats down the walkers effortlessly with his staff. It is revealed to be 
Morgan Jones
. Outside the gates, Aaron introduces himself and Daryl to Morgan, whom neither of the two knows, and asks him to join Alexandria. Morgan declines the offer, stating that he is heading somewhere, and asks for directions instead. As he gives his map to Daryl, Daryl is surprised that the map that Morgan has been using has Rick's name written on it.

The trio returns to the safe zone late at night, after the death of Deanna's husband, 
Reg
, and just as Rick executes 
Pete Anderson
, the town's surgeon. Rick and Morgan lock eyes in surprise, and Aaron stands in shock behind Morgan as he watches the scene.

"
First Time Again
"


Aaron soon reunited with Eric after witnessing Pete's execution by Rick. After the events that occurred, he and Daryl are officially retired from the recruitment program by Rick, per what happened to them earlier that day by the 
Wolves
. Aaron and Eric later attend the meeting in Deanna's house led by Rick to discuss the nearby quarry containing a herd that threatens the Safe Zone. Rick makes a plan to use diversion teams to lead the herd down the road and use a makeshift wall to curve the herd in the other direction. Aaron and Eric go out with the community to dig and build the wall, and later they return to the Safe Zone.



"
JSS
"


Shortly after returning to the Alexandria, the Safe Zone is invaded by the Wolves. One of the residents, 
Holly
, is attacked and stabbed by a member of the Wolves but is rescued by Aaron, Eric, and Rosita. The three bring her into the infirmary to Dr. 
Denise Cloyd
, who has come out of seclusion after the death of Pete. They group begins to formulate a plan, as Aaron tells Eric that he has to go out there but wants him to stay inside with Holly. When 
Eugene Porter
 volunteers to stay inside, Aaron disagrees, but Eugene is permitted to stay.

Aaron and Rosita then go out and flank the houses to take out a few members of the Wolves. He manages to successfully kill one of the members of the Wolves. After the attack, Aaron sweeps the area. Upon approaching Deanna's house, he finds a member of the Wolves with his personal bag that he dropped back at the Del Arno Factory. The bag contained photos and information on Alexandria, and Aaron begins to sob as he realizes that it was his fault that the Wolves were led to Alexandria and that he is indirectly responsible for the deaths in the community.



"
Now
"


In the aftermath of the Wolves attack, Rick returns to the safe zone with a herd following him which soon surround the walls. Rick gives a speech to reassure the safety of the citizens, with Aaron by Eric's side, looking concerned at each other. When the people of Alexandria criticized Rick, Aaron stepped up and defended Rick, claiming that Rick knew what he was doing and that his plan is working and that the others will return shortly. Aaron then admitted that he was at fault for leading the Wolves to Alexandria by leaving behind his pack.

Soon after, the citizens began to write the names of those who died in the attack on the wall as a memoriam, and Aaron becomes overwhelmed at the loss of life because of his fault. He then sees Maggie prepare to leave, and insists that he help her escape and find Glenn and the others. He shows her a way into the sewers that goes underneath the wall and outside the safe zone, and rejects Maggie's pleas to stay behind. When they enter the sewer, they find the exit overrun, and Maggie breaks down. She believes Glenn is dead and that reveals that she's pregnant. Aaron then comforts her.

Later that night, Aaron and Maggie were on post during nightshift. Maggie went down to the memoriam to erase Glenn's name, believing he is still alive. Aaron goes over and with Maggie he erases Nicholas' name. He then jokingly suggests Aaron as a name for the baby, and Erin for a girl's name.



"
No Way Out
"


When the herd invaded the safe zone, Aaron got separated from Eric and retreated into the infirmary with Heath and Spencer along with the other wounded while Eric retreated back in their house with Olivia. Aaron helped Denise in when she escaped from the Wolf leader. He assured her that all of her patients were fine.

Meanwhile, Carl was shot and Rick and Michonne were fighting the walkers as they were running to the infirmary. Aaron and Denise spotted them and wondered if he was bitten, and Denise concluded that he wasn't and ordered Aaron, Heath, and Spencer to prep for surgery. Rick and Michonne brought in a wounded Carl and Rick went back out to kill the walkers. Aaron concluded that he needed to go out to help Rick and Michonne, and Heath and Spencer joined them.

The defensive then inspired Eric and Olivia to help and soon the rest of the able-bodied community. Aaron and the others continued as Daryl lit the lake on fire and took out the rest of the walkers. Later that morning, Aaron was joined with Eric alongside the rest of the community outside the infirmary, covered in blood.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"


When newcomer 
Paul Rovia
, known as Jesus, brought Rick and members of his group to Paul's settlement, the 
Hilltop Colony
, Aaron helped guard Alexandria alongside Sasha. When Rick returned, he had Aaron and the others go inside the church for a meeting regarding the merger. Rick explained to them the situation of the merger with Hilltop, and their part in the deal being to neutralize the group known as the 
Saviors
 and their leader, 
Negan
, who previously attacked Daryl, Abraham, and Sasha. While Morgan suggested a peaceful approach, Aaron stood up and reminded them of the mistakes he made regarding leading the Wolves to Alexandria, and that they couldn't take that chance again. Aaron sided with Rick in killing these Saviors.

The next day, Aaron went out with the battalion. Their plan involved using a walker head double to fool the Saviors into thinking it's Gregory's, the leader of the Hilltop. But Aaron and the others quickly killed the guard outside and began a sneak attack while the Saviors slept. However, an alarm was triggered that resulted in a firefight. Aaron quickly got cornered and was nearly killed by one of the men with a shattered bottle, but he managed to kill him, claiming it would've been him or them. He then regrouped with Rosita as they charged out with the others. Before they headed out, they neutralized a fleeing Savior but soon discovered there were more out there and had Carol and Maggie.



"
Last Day on Earth
"


Aaron insists on going with the group to the Hilltop, and when Rick says no, Aaron tells him the only way to stop him would be by punching him in the face again, so Rick reluctantly allows him to come.

As they set off for the Hilltop, they repeatedly run into blockades of the Saviors stopping them from getting to the Hilltop. Carl asks Aaron why he came, to which he replies that he owes Maggie.

The group encounter another blockade, this time a large pile of logs. The Saviors' captive from earlier is then thrown over the bridge with a chain around his neck. As the man struggled, Aaron suggested shooting the chain or to at least put him out of his misery, but Rick argued that it wouldn't work and they needed to save the bullets. They are then forced to watch him die.

Realizing the Saviors' were always going to be one step ahead, they decided to bring Maggie to Hilltop on foot while Eugene took the RV back home. As Aaron helped carry Maggie to Hilltop, the group began to hear whistles. They started running, the whistles growing louder until they were surrounded by nearly a hundred men, with Eugene and the RV captured. Aaron was forced to give up his weapons and was put onto his knees alongside the others, as well as the captured Daryl, Glenn, Michonne and Rosita.

Negan
 finally approached the group and delivered a speech how he doesn't wish to kill them, because he wants the Survivors to work for him, but he states that the group needs to be punished for killing dozens of Negan's men. Negan, using his barbed baseball-bat named "Lucille", decides a victim by "Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Mo." A victim was decided and Negan beat their head in while the others screamed in horror.

Later that day at an emergency council meeting, Aaron listens as Michonne decides that instead of retaliating against the Whisperers, she and a small group will meet with Alpha at the border to work things out. Under Michonne's plan, Aaron is placed in charge of leading a team to take out the southern wave of walkers. While he screws a mace onto his arm, Gabriel informs Aaron Negan's going to fight alongside him due to a lack of soldiers at the moment.

In the woods, Aaron and Negan kill some walkers. When Negan finds a crowbar, Aaron demands him to put it down. Negan says he's not the guy he thinks he is but Aaron makes him continue to use the broomstick to kill the incoming walkers. At night, Negan takes out a walker with the crowbar which prompts Aaron to demand he heads back. When Negan tries to dismiss him, Aaron pushes him to the ground. 
"I did what I had to do back then,"
 Negan claims about his past actions. Aaron asks why Eric had to die and Negan tells him if he doesn't protect what belongs to him then it belongs to someone else. Aaron shoots back that if he failed Eric then Negan failed his wife and she died hating him.  

Aaron is suddenly attacked by walkers as Negan escapes. He kills them, but the blood causes his eyes to go blurry. As Aaron searches for Negan, he stumbles into a cabin where his blurry vision causes him to bang around the cabin as walkers storm in.

While the council discusses their vote on Negan's fate, Aaron opposes to Negan being spared due to all the people he has killed and that something inside him is broken. Daryl arrives and says he believes Lydia, which ties the vote. Gabriel announces he'll take the night to make his decision by tomorrow.

The following morning, Aaron and Gabriel discuss Negan's escape when Lydia walks by and tells them she is responsible, much to their shock and confusion.



"
What It Always Is
"


Aaron is looking for Negan in the woods while also practicing with his sword. While passing over a bridge, Aaron hears footsteps and hides to investigate. He watches as 
Gamma
 cuts open a walker and spill its guts on the river in order to contaminate the water. 

Later that day, Aaron encounters Gamma by the creed again and tosses her some bandages after watching her cut her hand. He introduces himself and tries to get her to do the same, but she picks up the bandage and runs off. Aaron sarcastically yells that she is welcome and then leaves.



"
Open Your Eyes
"


Aaron and Gamma meet on a bridge at one of the borders. She questions how his community is full of supplies like bread. He offers her some but she turns him down. Gamma then notices a drawing by Gracie in his bag and he reveals he has a daughter. She is surprised to hear that they have children in the community and explains that children hold you back. When Aaron asks about siblings, Gamma lies and tells him she's an only child.

Later that day, Aaron tells Gamma she can keep the drawing and tries to ask about her past. When she doesn't answer, he calls her out for digging for intel and thinks he should be doing the same. He then opens up about his younger brother and tries for her to the same. Before she can give in, Gamma leaves while repeating the Whisperer motto to herself.

That night, Aaron meets with Gamma again. She hands him back Gracie's drawing and when he reaches for it, she grabs him from behind and puts a knife to his neck to question him. Suddenly, Carol emerges from the woods with her arrow pointed as Lydia also arrives. Aaron then sees as Gamma panics and runs off into the woods. When Carol tries to stop Lydia from leaving as well, he watches as Lydia hits her with her stick and crosses the border too.



"
The World Before
"


Aaron meets Gamma at the border on the bridge again and she asks if the baby that was left to die outside Hilltop is still alive. When she reveals he is her nephew, Aaron says he was rescued by a family and is named Adam. She offers him information in exchange for seeing Adam. Before accepting any type of deal, Aaron makes her take off her mask and to tell the truth. Gamma says her name used to be Mary and reveals to him the location of Alpha's horde.

Upon arriving back at Alexandria, Aaron is informed about the recent events regarding Siddiq's death. He claims to be disgusted with how oblivious he was to Dante being spy living among them for the past four months, especially after he treated Gracie once. When Carol tells him not to blame himself, he reveals that he has been talking with a Whisperer and she has told him the location of Alpha's horde, explaining she just wants to see her nephew Adam. Despite his skepticism, Daryl orders Aaron to summon a group from Hilltop to help them with the mission.

Later that day, Aaron attends the funeral service for Siddiq and listens to Gabriel's religious remarks. He silently pays his respects and then leaves the ceremony with his daughter. At their home, they play a game where Gracie has to guess the capitals of each state from the license plate mural he made with Eric years prior. After winning, she asks for a story as her prize. Aaron tells her he once went hiking with a man he loved in Eureka, California. They stood in ancient ruins and listened to the sound of the ocean waves which were far away and wondered what life was like for the old civilization. She asks for the villagers' whereabouts but Aaron doesn't know what happened to them.

Aaron then goes alongside Daryl and Carol to the woods to meet up with the group from Hilltop. He hugs Magna and Kelly after not having seen them for a while. That night, the group crosses one of the borders in the woods to continue their mission. The next day, the group arrives at the location of the horde in a clearing only to find it's empty. Despite this, Aaron is confident Mary didn't lie but an angry Daryl says it was a waste of time and now they have to go search for the missing Lydia. When Carol chases after Alpha into a dark building, Aaron and the others follow her inside. The group then falls below a cave into a trap where they find themselves surrounded by most of the horde.



"
Squeeze
"


Having become trapped in the cave with the horde, Aaron and the group recover from the fall and realize Alpha is watching them from the top as they look around for a possible exit. He watches as Carol screams in anger and then helps Magna as she tries to climb a wall in vain. The group starts seeking other avenues of escape and eventually they decide to jump from rock to rock onto the other side of the cave in order to find another exit.

As the group moves through the cave, Aaron discusses with Jerry how much food they have left when Kelly tells them they don't have enough. He also tells Magna they don't have time to blame each other and they have to work together. When Magna is ambushed by a Whisperer, the group engages in a fight and kills several Whisperers, before deciding to follow the ones who escaped to find the exit. They follow the path and squeeze trough narrow tunnels until they find an underground mine station where Kelly discovers a box of dynamite. As the group starts digging for a way out, Aaron tells Magna to rest a little but she says she wants to escape to reunite with Yumiko.

When Carol accidentally drops a stick of dynamite in an effort to destroy the herd, the explosion causes the cave to begin collapsing. Aaron and Kelly make it to the surface and kill some Whisperers while Jerry holds a beam to prevent it from collapsing as they wait for the others. Daryl and Carol escape but Magna and Connie stay back and kill several Whisperers to protect Jerry, but he cannot hold the log anymore and leaves through the hole. The rest of the dynamite immediately explodes and the cave implodes, trapping Magna and Connie inside.

Aaron watches as Daryl tries to excavate trough the debris and tells him it could take weeks to reach them as he starts to sob. Kelly states that the explosion will attract walkers and Whisperers in the vicinity and they should leave because they won't be able to help Connie and Magna if they die. Daryl then tells the group to head home and inform everyone they found the horde, while he'll find the other entrance to the cave.



"
Stalker
"


Aaron returns to Alexandria the next day and is in disbelief when he sees new graves and realizes several Alexandrians were killed during an attack last night. He then informs to Gabriel and Scott that 
not
 
everyone
 from the scout group escaped from the cave. Afterwards, Aaron and Gracie leave with a group in wagons towards Hilltop so Rosita can be healed by the doctor and to discuss the incoming battle against the Whisperers.



"
Morning Star
"


Aaron arrives at Hilltop with the group, and Earl asks Aaron about who Mary is, the latter reveals her to be a former Whisperer that has defected, and that she wishes to see her nephew, Adam. Earl promptly shoots down this notion, not trusting Mary. Alden agrees with Earl, and assures him that they will only allow the Alexandrians to see Alex.

Aaron joins the discussion about what should be done with the Whisperers. Lydia thinks they should run, explaining that even if the explosion at the cave took out half the horde, Alpha would still have thousands of walkers left. Earl thinks the Whisperers might bypass them and go for Alexandria first, but Lydia negates this. Jerry wishes to stay and fight instead, while Dianne agrees with Lydia, believing that they can rebuild in another location. Earl is skeptical, however, and reckons that they will never find a place as good as Hilltop. While Yumiko points out they're heavily outnumbered, Earl insists that fighting is the best course of action, and even if they die, they will die for a place that means something. Aaron points out that there are children at Hilltop, too. Daryl agrees that they should get the kids out first, and instructs the others to pack up and regroup at Oceanside.

Later, Mary spots Adam and attempts to talk to him, but is intercepted by Alden, who prevents her from doing so. Despite Mary's pleas and Aaron's attempts to reason with him, Alden remains adamant about keeping Adam separate from Mary. Aaron is shown when everyone equips their weapons and armor.

As everyone is gathered on the front lines, Kelly puts her palms on the ground and confirms that the horde is close. Indeed, the horde soon emerges from the bushes and approaches the Hilltop. While they are momentarily halted by the electric fence, the walkers soon break through it and approach the second line of defense. Aaron orders the survivors to split ranks. The shield-wielding survivors reinforce the makeshift barbed wire fence, while the melee weapon-wielding survivors start taking out the walkers. The archers, meanwhile, stay in the back and rain arrows on the herd. Behind the herd, Beta commands the Whisperers to launch the sap they collected earlier using makeshift catapults into the front lines, drenching most of the defenders as well as the Hilltop's walls. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltop resident ablaze. With no choice, the defenders begin to retreat towards the Hilltop, but are trapped when the Whisperers launch another volley of fire-arrows into the Hilltop's walls, setting the community ablaze.

experience
, Aaron warns her that there is little hope for her actually catching the horses, and believes repairing the walls to be more important. Carol protests that, without the horses, they won't be able to scavenge far or move anything heavy, meaning they will starve.

Variant
"

While off-roading, wagon becomes stuck in a ditch and in an attempt to pull it out, Jerry becomes injured. Aaron rushes to his side with concern and helps him stand. Aaron then looks around and spots an abandoned renaissance fair with walls around it, deciding to camp there for the night.

Inside the fairgrounds, Aaron is crafting a crutch for Jerry to use with his kukri knife, and notices Lydia and Elijah building a fire.

Aaron admits to Lydia that the time he spent with Eric was the happiest time of his life, and he wishes he could take back the time that he rejected him. He tells Lydia that "loss is inevitable. It always has been. The only thing we can control is when we say yes," before leaving to sweep the fairgrounds.

That night, Aaron and Lydia sit by a campfire and hear a strange noise in the distance. Aaron reminds her they have checked the grounds several times and have secured the entrances and that its most likely just the wind. When they hear the noise again, Aaron agrees to go check it out, and they discover that a herd of walkers have gotten in. Aaron checks in with Lydia to make sure that she's comfortable fighting this many before attacking the walkers. The two get overwhelmed and wake up Jerry and Elijah, and the group retreat to a small building.

Inside the building, they are cornered on all sides and question how the walkers got in before noticing that something is trying to open the door. Jerry rushes to close the door, and Aaron believes that there are whisperers amongst the herd and is why they got in. Aaron orders Lydia and Elijah to crawl through the roof to escape and takes Jerry's place at the door so he can crawl through too. Aaron waits until everyone is up before crawling through too. Once everyone is safe, Aaron creates a plan for the group to separate the whisperers from the herd, and Lydia and Elijah jump down and start to clear out some of the walkers.

While Aaron watches Lydia and Elijah fight, one of the whisperers climbs a ladder and picks up a rock to attack Jerry with, and Aaron notices and fights it off. Aaron punches the whisperer, and knocks it to the ground, ripping its mask off. Aaron looks on in horror when he realizes that he ripped off the face of a walker instead of a whisperer mask. Aaron grabs the knife that Lydia stabbed in the walker's chest and kills it.

The next morning, it is revealed that the group was able to wipe out the rest of the herd. Aaron returns to roof and examines the face of the walker he killed. He reminds Jerry of all the different types of walkers that they have encountered throughout the years and says that he's heard stories of walkers that could climb walls and open doors, but he never knew if they were just stories.

Aaron then asks Jerry if he's sure he can travel, and Jerry tells him that the only reason he is able to is because Aaron saved him.

When they leave the renaissance fair, Aaron agrees with Jerry's earlier comment about the fairgrounds looking like a Kingdom 2.0, and jokes that it could be a place built for King Jerry.

In the woods, 
Lydia
 puts down a walker with her knife against the objections of 
Elijah
 who is worried that it could've been one of the climber variants. Although 
Jerry
 makes a joke about it, Aaron warns the others that they all need to stay alert as they don't know if their 
encounter
 with a climber was a one-time thing or not and there might be more of them out here. Aaron notices footsteps nearby, but Lydia recognizes them as being human, not walker. Aaron's group readies themselves to defend against possible threats, but 
Luke
 and 
Jules
 emerge from the trees instead. The friends are happily reunited with each other while Aaron introduces Luke and Jules to Elijah whom they have yet to meet. Jerry invites the two to join them in journeying to 
Oceanside
, but Luke explains that 
"it's gone, man. It ain't ours anymore. These guys in white gear 
showed up
 and... said they were from the Commonwealth"
 with Jules adding that they had just taken over. Aaron is surprised as they had 
made a deal
 with the Commonwealth, but Luke tells him that something must've changed as the Commonwealth Army is tracking him and Jules right now and they're dead if they're found. Luke suggests getting far away from Oceanside as humanly possible which Aaron agrees with. Shocked by the news, everyone begins moving out.

Aaron's group puts down several walkers and Luke and Jules explain that they were out scavenging and thus they weren't present when 
Lance Hornsby
's men arrived at Oceanside. They were hiding behind the houses trying to figure out what the hell to do with Luke wanting to stay and fight. However, 
Rachel
 wasn't having it and she insisted that they had to go, warn everybody and tell them what was coming which is why Luke and Jules had left in the end. Luke and Jules haven't seen Rachel or any of the others since and Luke feels guilty that they didn't stay and fight. Jerry and Aaron reassure them that they've got the group and everyone else now who are heading for Alexandria right now. Luke asks if that includes his old 
group
 which Aaron confirms. Hearing the sound of engines nearby, everyone quickly hides behind the wagon. Lydia and Elijah realize that the soldiers are closing in and that they can't outrun them. Spotting a 
herd
 moving nearby, Lydia looks at one of the dead walkers and gets an idea.

That night, Aaron's group, 
covered in walker guts
, moves with the massive herd, Lydia whispering directions to the others to move east. Two Commonwealth jeeps drive up and begins leading the herd in another direction, forcing Aaron, Lydia, Elijah, Jerry, Luke and Jules to follow them in order to maintain their cover. Lydia is bumped into by a walker, causing her to drop her knife which is then picked up by a variant walker that's amongst the herd.

Family
"


In the woods, a Commonwealth jeep leads a large 
herd
, amongst them Aaron, 
Lydia
, 
Elijah
, 
Jerry
, 
Luke
 and 
Jules
, 
covered in walker guts
. Spotting a break ahead to the right, Aaron whispers the message that it's now their chance with the others planning to make a break for the trees. However, as the group begins to make their break for it, a soldier pulls up on a motorcycle, leading a second herd in from the side that joins up with the massive herd that the jeep is leading, trapping Aaron's group amongst the walkers once more. From the other side, a third herd is brought in by another motorcycle, resulting in a massive herd of thousands of walkers having been corralled together by two Commonwealth jeeps and two motorcycles. Having completed their mission, the soldiers drive off, leaving the herd heading towards 
the Commonwealth
 itself which is just miles away.

As they continue, Aaron spots an abandoned RV up ahead and directs the others towards it. Putting down a walker in the RV, Aaron, Jerry and Lydia manage to get inside, but Jules gets swept away by the herd and Luke goes after his girlfriend. Trying to enter the RV, Elijah gets caught in the herd and as Lydia desperately tries to hang on to her boyfriend's hand, she is bitten in the left arm by a walker before Aaron and Jerry pull her into the RV as Elijah gets swept away as well. As the herd continues on towards the Commonwealth, a number of walkers begin banging on the RV's door, trying to get at the survivors within.

In the RV, Lydia frantically tries to go back out into the herd to search for Elijah, unwilling to risk losing him, while Aaron and Jerry try to stop her in order to deal with her bite. Aaron finally manages to get Lydia to see reason by pointing out that if they don't act quickly, Elijah will lose her instead. Jerry promises that they will find him as soon as they can, but they have to 
amputate her arm
 first. Lydia takes a seat and Jerry makes a torniquet for her out of his belt. Aaron reminds Lydia that he lost his arm too and he made it alright and reassures Lydia that she is so loved. Aaron promises Lydia that they will get her through this before Jerry chops her arm off with his sword.

Lydia regains consciousness in the RV as walkers bang on the outside from all sides. Despite being weak from blood loss, Lydia insists that they have to go after the others who need their help. Aaron states that Lydia needs a doctor first while Jerry tries to reassure her that Elijah, Luke and Jules are all pros. Lydia tearfully refuses to abandon their friends, stating that they don't leave each other and the others need them. Aaron and Jerry embrace the sobbing girl and Jerry decides to go back into the herd by himself to find the others, stating that Lydia has lost enough. Ordering Aaron and Lydia to get her arm looked at, Jerry promises that they will meet up later, 
"I find them... I find you. Piece of cobbler. See you on the other side."
 Zipping up his jacket and pulling up his hood, Jerry opens the door and carefully slips back into the herd which continues to ignore him due to the walker guts covering Jerry.



"
Rest in Peace
"


At 
the Commonwealth
 
police station
, 
Mercer
, 
Ezekiel
, 
Max
, 
Princess
 and 
Dianne
 load supplies onto a truck while 
Maggie
 loads a 
sniper rifle
. 
Negan
 asks if Maggie intends to use it on Pamela and states that his offer to her still stands, but Maggie refuses. The 
herd
 begins to approach the police station and Maggie tells the others that they have to go. Mercer raises his gun to shoot at the walkers, but Ezekiel stops him, recognizing Aaron and 
Lydia
 walking amongst the herd, 
covered in walker guts
. Ezekiel runs to help the injured Lydia, asking about 
Jerry
 and 
Elijah
, but Aaron tells him that they're still out there. As the herd overruns the police station, the group loads up onto the truck with Aaron promising to fill everyone else in on the way. The group drives off to meet up with the others at the hospital. Ezekiel later radios in that they've got Mercer and asks for any updates on the kids. 
Gabriel
 reports the good news and Ezekiel promises to see them at the hospital.

At night, outside of a loading dock, Mercer observes a crowd of desperate Commonwealth residents demanding to be let into the Estates. Mercer reassures Maggie that they will be able to move soon while Aaron tells Ezekiel that he saw people on the higher floors and rooftops begging for help, but he wanted to make sure that Lydia was safe first. Ezekiel reassures his friend that he did the right thing. Hearing screams in the distance, both men are determined to do more, but they need to take care of Judith first. Lieutenant 
Rose
 arrives in another truck and reports to Mercer that they're all set: everyone is in the back and there's no one to check. The doctors have set up a safe house, but they have to hurry. Mercer calls for everyone to go, stating that they need to get Judith to 
Tomi
. Everyone boards the truck with Princess, Max and Dianne pushing Judith's stretcher.

At the safe house, Aaron wraps up Lydia's stump and offers her some advice based on his own experience with losing an arm. Having learned of 
Luke
 and 
Jules
' deaths, Lydia is upset and believes that the still-missing Elijah and Jerry are dead too. 
"That's just what happens. You know, people die. Cities fall. And things just don't work out. People tell me they do, but they don't."
 However, Aaron refuses to give up hope that their friends are still alive somewhere and he promises that they will find them both. A concerned Maggie enters, looking for Negan, but nobody has seen him in awhile.

Suddenly, there's shouts outside and two gunshots. Looking outside, Mercer sees a man trying to climb the wall, only to be shot by Commonwealth soldiers on Pamela's orders. Mercer tells the others that the soldiers are shooting anyone that climbs the gates and grabs a gun, unwilling to just stand by as people are dying. Mercer informs the Coalition members that the truck is gassed up with enough reserves in the rear to get them home. Mercer and his men can sneak them out the back as Mercer believes that this isn't their fight or their people. 
"Yes, they are. And so are you,"
 states Ezekiel. Addressing the others, Ezekiel tells them that 
"you may not think this place is worth saving, and I get that, given how they treated us. But it's worth it to me. The people are worth it, and I'm not gonna allow them to fall without a fight. Not today. I'm with you. Who else?"
 Aaron immediately agrees, stating that they can do more than just save themselves and they need to. Following Ezekiel's lead, everyone agrees to fight to save the Commonwealth.

At the gates of the Estates, the crowd desperately begs Pamela to be let in, amongst them 
Mr. Martens
, 
Mrs. Martens
 and 
Mei
. On a balcony, Maggie lines up her shot on Pamela, but Negan tells her to hold on as Mercer and his loyalist forces move in, ordering Colonel 
Vickers
 and her men to lower their weapons. Pamela orders Vickers to arrest them, but the Coalition forces join Mercer's troops from another angle, creating a standoff. Pamela accuses Mercer of being a traitor, but Mercer states that she's the true traitor and lists Pamela's crimes: disappearing hundreds of citizens, leading the dead to their doorstep, shooting a child and now leaving thousands to die.

The banging on the gates grows more frantic as the herd begins to approach the Estates, meaning that the people will die if they're not let inside. Gabriel moves towards the gates despite Vickers orders to stop. Gabriel announces that they're opening the gate and letting everyone inside, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him. Vickers threatens to shoot him, but Carol warns her that they will fire back if she does. Pamela orders her men to shoot Gabriel as he reaches the gates and one of them points a gun at his head. Suddenly, Daryl yells for them to stop. 
"What the hell you doing?"
 Daryl demands. 
"We all deserve better than this. You built this place to be like the old world. That was the fuckin' problem."
 Pamela states that if she opens the gates, the dead will get in too, not just the living. Daryl tells her that if she doesn't, Pamela will lose everything anyway. 
"We got one enemy. We ain't the walking dead."


Realizing that Daryl is right, Vickers orders everyone to lower their weapons and give Gabriel the key to the gates. Everyone stands down and Vickers defers to Mercer's command who places Pamela under arrest for high crimes against the people of the Commonwealth. As everyone rushes to help let the people in, Maggie informs Negan that Pamela is getting arrested and Negan tells her that prison is a fate worse than death for someone like Pamela, causing Maggie to relent in shooting her.

The crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in 
Alexandria
 and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified 
Lance Hornsby
, Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of 
suicide
. Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rife, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back.

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates.

Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

In Alexandria, everyone enjoys a celebration and feast, joined by Mercer, Max and Tomi. Judith gives 
Dog
 some of her food and Yumiko raises a toast to Luke. Looking out the window, Daryl sees Negan walking away and the two men exchange a smile and a nod, parting on good terms. Yumiko turns to Magna, telling her 
"same"
 and Magna kisses her, the two women resuming their romantic relationship. Sitting down, Rosita smiles as she watches the celebration before becoming somber. Noticing Rosita's somber mood, Gabriel joins her, and Rosita tells him that she just wants to remember this perfect moment. In a whisper, Rosita reveals her bite and impending death to Gabriel. Noticing Rosita's behavior and crying, Judith realizes that something's wrong with her and becomes upset, apparently deducing the truth.

A year later, Daryl and Carol, who is now wearing her hair short again as she did before Rick's disappearance, look at the old memorial wall of the people that the community had lost. Alexandria has been fully rebuilt and is thriving again with the residents enjoying everyday life together. Aaron, Gabriel, Coco, and 
Gracie
 greet Lydia, Elijah, Judith and 
RJ
 and Lydia gives Gabriel a package from Father 
Grant
 and his 
old congregation
. Daryl and Carol join them while Jerry and 
Nabila
, walking through town as their daughters play outside, smile at them. Aaron admits that he never thought that they'd get back to any of this, although he had hope. Aaron calls them all very lucky, but Gabriel corrects Aaron that it's effort rather than luck. They have a lot to be proud of in their family, community, and future.

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Logan
.

Aaron was described as "Early to Late 30s. An affable, good-natured, adventurous guy. Despite feeling like a bit of an outsider for most of his life (or perhaps because of it), he's passionate about people and the good they can do. He doesn't think twice about putting himself in danger if he believes something positive can come from it."


Robert Kirkman
 hinted on a 
Talking Dead
 special in November 2014 that the second half of 
Season 5
 "will contain a very prominent gay character from the 
comics
", likely referring to Aaron. 
Ross Marquand
 was later confirmed in January 2015 by 
TVLine
 to be playing the character.

Aaron is the first openly male homosexual in the 
series
, followed by 
Eric Raleigh
, 
Paul Rovia
, 
Livitz
, and 
Zell
.


Aaron is the third openly homosexual character, preceded by 
Tara Chambler
 and 
Alisha
, then followed by 
Eric Raleigh
, 
Denise Cloyd
, 
Paul Rovia
, 
Magna
, 
Yumiko Okumura
, 
Kelly
, 
Alpha
, 
Livits
, and 
Zell
.


As of 
Jesus
' death in "
Evolution
", Aaron is the only openly homosexual male main character still alive. And with Tara's death in "
The Calm Before
", he is now the longest-living LGBTQ+ character on the show.


It was confirmed in "
Variant
" that Aaron and Eric were married - making them the first LGBT married couple in 
The Walking Dead
 franchise, followed by 
Felix Carlucci
 and 
Will Campbell
 in 
World Beyond
, 
Tim
 and his 
husband
 in the 
Clementine
 series, 
Magna
 and 
Yumiko Okumura
 in the TV series, and 
Rèmy
 and 
Julien
 in 
Daryl Dixon
.


Ross Marquand had auditioned originally for the role of 
Gareth
. Due to Ross Marquand's comedic acting and impressions, the casting director thought Ross would be better suited for Aaron because of the character's humor and had him return shortly after auditioning for Gareth to audition for Aaron.


Gregory Peck's role as Atticus Finch in 1962's 
To Kill a Mockingbird
 was the basis of Ross Marquand's portrayal of Aaron. Ross elaborated that it was the character of Atticus Finch that got him interested in acting and had previously performed as him in a theater production. He also believed Aaron and Atticus had similar beliefs and traits of acceptance, altruism, and justice.


Aaron is the first character involved in politics that was encountered in the 
TV Series
, with the second being 
Deanna Monroe
 and the third being 
Pamela Milton
.

He was a politico in D.C., but he left before he had an official title. This was because he believed he could better use his altruistic personality in a hands-on approach in the peace corps rather than becoming a politician.


Dante Esquivel
 from 
Fear the Walking Dead
 is also a politician, being the Municipal President of Tijuana. 
Qaletaqa Walker
 can also count as someone who is in politics as being the Chief of the Hopi Tribe.


Ross Marquand revealed that Aaron is a fan of 
The Smiths
, his favorite song specifically being "Hand in Glove", which in the lyrics alludes to lead singer Morrisey's sexuality and the homophobia that gay couples encounter when being public.


Aaron was originally planned to appear in the episode "
Start to Finish
", but his scenes were cut.


Given his surprise to when he catches Eric praying before battling the Saviors, it's possible Aaron is agnostic or atheist.


In the script for "
The Day Will Come When You Won't Be
", there were three alternative death scenes, where two of them involved Aaron dying. One of them involved Maggie and Aaron dying, and another one where Aaron died first and Eugene dying afterwards.
[2]


Aaron is one of three characters known to use a substitute appendage on an amputate limb. The others being 
Merle Dixon
 and 
Hershel Greene
.

He is also the first character on 
The Walking Dead
 who use an iron arm prototype to substitute his own lost arm.


Actor Tom Payne confirmed that Aaron and Jesus had a sexual encounter at least once during the six-year time-jump. Ross Marquand added that had Jesus survived, he and Aaron would eventually become romantically together.


Aaron and 
Gabriel Stokes
 are the only characters introduced in 
Season 5
 that are confirmed to be alive.

Aaron is the first Alexandrian to appear in the series and the longest lasting survivor from 
Alexandria
. Aaron is also the only remaining main character introduced in Alexandria.


Aaron, Gabriel, and 
Barbara
 are the only named characters introduced in Season 5 to not die in the 
TV Series
.


Ross Marquand confirmed that at some point, Aaron did reveal to Gracie that she was adopted from the Saviors during the war, but he did not disclose to her that her father was directly killed by Rick in battle.


Aaron is one of two known characters in 
The Walking Dead
 universe who hates salmon patties. The other being 
Charlie
.


A nightmare sequence involving Aaron in "
First Time Again
" was cut. Ross described it as Aaron and Eric in their living room, having a discussion about whether or not they should fight the 
Wolves
. Suddenly, a Wolf comes up behind Eric and slits his throat. His blood shoots onto Aaron's face.
[3]


Regarding the anthology spin-off 
Tales of the Walking Dead
, Ross Marquand mentioned he would like to see a backstory episode of Aaron in Nigeria while working for the NGO shortly before the outbreak.

Tom Payne mentioned he would like to have an episode that featured the love story between Jesus and Aaron that took place during Season 8 and Season 9 time-jumps.


Ross Marquand confirmed that 
the sword
 that Aaron currently wields had once belonged to 
Paul Rovia
.
[4]
 He stated: 
"(...) it's sort of a ceremonial sword for him. Angela [Kang] and I both discussed it, and I said I don't think that he would just retire that sword. I think he would use that sword especially in very, very important battles, not only as a way of honoring Jesus, and everything that he taught Aaron, but also because it's a way of connecting the past the future. I think he held a great deal of reverence and friendship for Jesus, and that sword is a wonderful way of him continuing that tradition."


Aaron did a similar symbolic gesture when Eric died, and carried his gun from "
Monsters
" until the Saviors were defeated in "
Wrath
".


Aaron stopped using the sword after attaching a mace to the end of 
his prosthetic arm
, but he resumed using the weapon after trading the mace back in for a wooden hand attachment. This is best seen in "
Rest in Peace
" where Aaron uses the sword while fighting walkers in the Commonwealth.


Aaron's appearance from 
Season 9
 onwards bears a striking resemblance to 
Rick Grimes
' appearance from 
Issue 127
 onwards. Both characters have a short buzzcut, long beards and a prosthetic arm.


Aaron tells Lydia that she will occasionally suffer from phantom limb syndrome in "
Rest in Peace
", implying that he still does.


Aaron's original ending in "
Rest in Peace
" involved Lydia giving Aaron a letter from a male admirer in the Commonwealth. Aaron declines, explaining that he is too busy - similar to how Aaron initially rejected Eric's advances for the same reasons. Gracie takes her father to the side and encourages him to pursue the relationship, arguing that he is always selfless and for once should do something for himself.


Aaron is one of twelve characters to survive the 
TV Series
 who also survive in the 
Comic Series
, the others being 
Maggie Rhee
, 
Michonne Grimes
, 
Eugene Porter
, 
Hershel Rhee
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Magna
, 
Yumiko Okumura
, 
Lydia
, 
Juanita Sanchez
, 
Michael Mercer
, and 
Pamela Milton
.


Aaron is the fifth main character to receive an amputation, with the first being 
Hershel Greene
, the second being 
Merle Dixon
, the third being 
Bob Stookey
, the fourth being 
Tyreese Williams
, and the sixth being 
Lydia
.
