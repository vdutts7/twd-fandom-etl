war

Jerry
 and 
Nabila
 had three children, with Aliyah being the middle child.
In the Kingdom, Aliyah spends time with her family as everyone is setting things ready for the fair. She and her brother then wave at Jerry as he leaves on a deer hunting mission.
At the fair, Aliyah plays with her brother and father. At night, she and her family attend the theater and watch the movie.
Several months after the fair massacre, the Kingdommers are forced to abandon their fallen community due to an incoming blizzard and move to the Hilltop. When snow starts falling later that day, Aliyah and the convoy is forced to take shelter inside the Sanctuary for the night where she and her family rest and stay warm.
Later that night, the convoy leaves the factory and is forced to cross into Alpha's territory. When they encounter a frozen lake, members of the group kill walkers that emerge from the snowbanks before the whole convoy manages to escape safely across the ice where Aliyah and her siblings are embraced by their parents, who are glad for their safety. The next morning, the convoy finally arrives at the Hilltop where Aliyah spends time with her family in their new community.
Some months after the blizzard, Aliyah is brought alongside some children to see the beach for the first time at Oceanside while the militia trains. Afterwards, she and her brother play with R.J. and Judith in the sand. When the satellite falls from the sky later that day, Aliyah and her brother are protected by Jerry.
Aliyah is among the children and parents to be evacuated from Hilltop. However, the caravan is prevented from reaching Oceanside after reaching a roadblock consisting of a fallen tree, the doings of the Whisperers. The caravan turns back to Hilltop, along with the bodies of murdered scouts 
Felix
 and 
Penny
. That night, she takes refuge inside Hilltop along with her mother and siblings as well as with the other children and civilians as the coalition soldiers fight against the Whisperers and their horde.
The Whisperers attack the Hilltop Colony with their horde and flaming arrows - setting fire to the Colony. 
Ezekiel
 began to lead the children out of Hilltop - including Aliyah - but could not locate Judith. 
Earl Sutton
 was able to locate Judith and took charge of Aliyah and the other children while Ezekiel fought at the Hilltop.
Earl brought Aliyah and the other children to a safe-house in the woods awaiting for their parents while he continued to suffer from the bite from a walker on his arm. He refilled Aliyah's water cup and reassured the children that their parents would be proud of them. While Aliyah and the rest of the children remained together, Judith took care of Earl in the backroom before he could turn and harm the others. When Ezekiel, Daryl, and Jerry find the shack in the woods, Aliyah and her brother reunite with their father.
Aliyah is at the rendezvous with the rest of her family recovering from the Hilltop battle and awaiting for more survivors to arrive.
Aliyah is among the Hilltop survivors to relocate to an abandoned hospital referred to as the ""
Tower
"" where she and her family, and dozens of others, seek refuge on the upper floors of the hospital. As a group of survivors enact a plan to lure the herd away, others defend the hospital from the Whisperers and snipe as many as they can from the windows. When the Whisperers eventually break into the hospital, Aliyah and the others are evacuated safely from the hospital via the elevator shafts and basement tunnels. After 
Beta
 and the Whisperers are wiped out, the remaining survivors congregate in the woods where the injured are treated and families are reunited. Aliyah sits with her mother and siblings as 
Bertie
 greets them and chats with the family.
Following the conclusion of the Whisperer War, Aliyah is among the Hilltop refugees to move to Alexandria.
Aliyah is with her brother, Gracie, Hershel, and RJ outside learning basic defense lessons from Judith. Armed with a play sword, she practices her stances. Later that afternoon, she is inside a house playing with the other children when Judith confronts 
Vincent
 and some of the older kids about whether or not they damaged artwork created by her 
late brother
.
