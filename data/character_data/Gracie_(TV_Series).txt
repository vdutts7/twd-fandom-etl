As a storm rages in Alexandria, Gracie is terrified and hugs Judith and R.J.

When Aaron tells Gracie that he is going out into the storm, Gracie is upset that her father is risking his life and questions why it has to be him that goes.

Judith comes over and offers to stay with Gracie, making her feel a little better. Aaron expresses gratitude to her friend and kisses Gracie's forehead goodbye.

Later, Gracie admits to Judith that she wishes she were more like her because she's never afraid. Judith disagrees with Gracie about being unafraid and explains that she was taught to turn her fear into strength, and Gracie can, too. This encouragement cheers Gracie up, and she practices her swordplay with Judith's katana. When Gracie gets a little too close to a window, her jacket is grabbed by a walker. She drops the katana in shock, and Judith races over to slice it's arm off before killing it. Gracie hugs Virgil as she watches the adults board the windows.

A second walker breach almost breaks down Gracie's door. Rosita decides to go out into the storm to fight all the walkers in the yard and give them more time. Gracie watches her fight in admiration.

Inspired by Judith and Rosita, Gracie is determined to help fight and she looks for a weapon in her basement, which is now flooding. Judith follows after her and questions why Gracie is down there before helping her look. Judith breaks off a broomstick and hands it to Gracie, insisting that they have to hurry back.

Gracie begins to look around for objects that might help them escape but is grabbed by a walker when her back is turned. Judith saves her by killing the walkers but accidently drops her sword in the struggle, and is forced to kick them away instead. Gracie's father hears the commotion and breaks the glass to gather the walkers' attention away from the children and jumps inside to slay the walkers. Aaron orders Gracie and Judith to get to the window so he can lift them out and they can get to safety. 

The next day, Gracie and Aaron are seen greeting the group returning from Meridian with a cart full of food, but are interrupted by Jerry when he announces the arrival of an approaching

, the fifth being 
Hershel Rhee
, the sixth being 
R.J. Grimes
, the seventh being 
Ezra
, the eighth being 
Aliyah
, and the ninth being 
Mariam
.


Gracie is the first child to be adopted by one of the communities from an antagonistic group, with the second being 
Adam Sutton
.


With 
Regina
's death in "
Who Are You Now?
", Gracie is the last surviving inhabitant of the 
Shephard Office Plaza
.


Gracie is one of only three named former Saviors confirmed to be alive, the others being 
Negan
 and 
Eugene Porter
.

Of these, Negan and Gracie are the only original Saviors confirmed to be alive.


She is also the only character introduced in 
Season 8
 that is confirmed to be alive.


She is also the only member of the Saviors who has never been antagonistic to be alive.


She is also the youngest member of the Saviors.


It was revealed in "
The World Before
" that Gracie not only has an excellent memory, but also knows all the capitals of each state in the 
United States of America
.


Ross Marquand
 revealed that, at some point, Aaron did discuss with Gracie that she is adopted and was rescued from the Saviors, but left out the fact that her father was directly killed by Rick in the battle.


Gracie is mentioned several times by Aaron in "
One More
" as he and Gabriel talk about ending their supply run and returning home to their kids, and during 
Mays
' taunting of Aaron. During the episode, Aaron brings home toys from the warehouse for Gracie and 
Socorro Espinosa
.

On 
Talking Dead
, it is revealed that, according to the script, the toy brand is called "Abnorminals", and each one is a hybrid. Gracie's stuffed animal is a mix between a seal, a rabbit and a squirrel. Gracie can be seen briefly cuddling the toy in "
Out of the Ashes
".
[1]


Gracie wears clothing items that either replicate or belong to Aaron.

She owns a handmade glove that is designed to look similar to Aaron's prosthetic arm, and can be seen wearing it in "
The World Before
" and "
A Certain Doom
".


Gracie can also be seen wearing the shirt that Aaron wore in "
A New Beginning
" and "
Silence the Whisperers
" when she sleeps in it during the episode "
Out of the Ashes
".
[2]


In an interview, 
Cailey Fleming
 confirms that Gracie is 
Judith Grimes
' best friend.
[3]


Since "Out of the Ashes", it is confirmed that Aaron and Gracie have an evacuation plan. She has to lock herself in her basement and use her whistle to signal if she is in danger.


The original ending of the show had a time-skip of at least 10 years, and an adult Gracie was shown riding in the back of a van with Judith, R.J. Socorro and Ezra searching for other survivors to bring back to their community. 
[4]


In this deleted scene, Gracie has the same job that Aaron had when he was introduced.


In this scene Gracie is portrayed by Tess Cline, and is supposed to be roughly in her mid 20's.


Ross Marquand revealed there was a deleted scene from the ending of "Rest in Peace" where Lydia gives Aaron a letter from a male admirer in the Commonwealth. Aaron declines, explaining that he is too busy - similar to how Aaron initially rejected Eric's advances for the same reasons. Gracie then encourages him to pursue the relationship, arguing that he is always selfless and for once should do something for himself.
