Overview
[

[

"
The Obliged
"
[
]


In 
Alexandria
, as 
Michonne
 and 
Judith
 are sitting together on the porch of their house, Nora knocks on their gate. She tells Michonne that crows have been eating about a fourth of Alexandria's tomato crops. Michonne says that the windmill will help once it's built and that she will talk to 
Eugene
 when he gets back. Nora also mentions that 
Negan
 is refusing to eat food that 
Scott
 gave him, to which Michonne replies that she'll handle it.



"
Who Are You Now?
"
[
]


Six years after 
Rick Grimes
' "
death
", Nora is part of the 
council
 that governs Alexandria and she joins the rest of the council in the church as they interview 
Magna's group
 before voting on whether or not they should be permitted to join the community. She and the other residents are shocked when Michonne reveals what 
Magna
's hand tattoo means.



"
Guardians
"
[
]


In Alexandria, Nora, along with 
Laura
 and 
Kyle
, listens as Michonne, 
Siddiq
, and 
Aaron
 discuss the 
new threat
, as well as the state of the Kingdom and their invitation to attend the fair. She speaks up and suggests they put the fair invitation up to a vote. Ultimately, it is revealed Nora and the rest of the council decide to send a delegation to the Kingdom to attend the fair.



Season 10
[
]


"
Lines We Cross
"
[
]


Nora is among the council members to enter the meeting house as the 
teacher
 is going over her lessons with 
Lydia
, 
Gracie
, and several other Alexandrian children. The council announces they need to cut class short as they need the space to hold an emergency meeting regarding the discovery of a Whisperer mask in Oceanside.



"
Ghosts
"
[
]


Nora listens as Aaron tells the council that the walkers are coming in constant waves. Michonne tells everyone to take care of it and to remember their training. Later that day at an emergency council meeting, Nora listens as Michonne tells everyone instead of retaliating, she and a small group will meet with 
Alpha
 at the border to work things out.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"
[
]


Nora is at the dining hall enjoying a meal when Lydia makes a scene by gutting a dead squirrel, upsetting 
Gage
, 
Margo
, and 
Alfred
. She watches as the three leave in disgust before returning to her meal.

Later that night, Nora and the council reunite in the meeting house to discuss Lydia's attack. They question Gage and Alfred, who lie and say they were attacked. Gabriel asks why Lydia's the one in the infirmary. They claim to them how their friends got beheaded by the Whisperers and now Margo is dead. The council then lets them go.

While the council discusses their vote on Negan's fate, Nora opposes to Negan being spared after explaining her own motives. Daryl arrives and says he believes Lydia, which ties the vote. Gabriel announces he'll take the night to make his decision by tomorrow.



"

Trivia
[
]


Nora's character was created and inspired by a writer for the show, 
Geraldine Inoa
.
[1]


Inoa exited the show as a writer after 
Season 10
, likely contributing to the negligence of Nora's character.


Nora appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".
