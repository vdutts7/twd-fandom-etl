Having survived the assault made on the community by the Wolves , Bob is one of the many townspeople by the front gate, listening to the growing horde gathering outside the walls and mourning the loss of his wife, who was killed in the attack. He is very concerned about the situation and listens to Rick and Aaron as they address the crowd. Bob attends Gabriel 's prayer circle with Kent , Barbara , Kyle , and several other Alexandrians when they witness Enid and Glenn's green balloons floating in the sky, just before the wall is brought down by the collapsing church steeple, allowing the herd to invade Alexandria.

Bob remains in the sewers with the other residents as the Saviors' grenades continue to blow apart Alexandria above them. After the explosions subside and the remaining Saviors leave, Bob and the others leave to the Hilltop for refuge. While unseen, Bob travels through the woods and swamp to the Hilltop Colony with surviving Alexandrians and is welcomed into the community with open arms.
