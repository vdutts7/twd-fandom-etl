's location.",Nothing is known about Romano's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point during the outbreak, Romano joined a 
community
 in Ohio.
In a flash forward, Romano and a squadron of soldiers are gathered outside Hilltop's gates as Daryl speaks with Maggie and Elijah.
Romano is one of the sixteen soldiers accompanying Lance Hornsby as he investigates the events that took place at Riverbend. He and the rest of the squad arrive at Hilltop and eventually granted entry inside to search the town for the stolen Commonwealth weapons. After no weapons are found and an intense confrontation between the Rhees and Lance, Romano and the other Commonwealth soldiers eventually leave Hilltop with their boss. That night, he and the others encounter Leah in the woods where Lance strikes up a deal with the lone Reaper.
Trooper Romano is in the woods with the rest of the squadron as Lance Hornsby flips a coin, splitting up the squadron into two groups. Romano asks Lance what the purpose of the diving up into two groups, to which Lance replies that Romano will soon find out. Daryl, Gabriel, and Aaron are among those assigned to Romano's group, and they head out on a scouting mission to check out three locations, including a large house, in search of the Riverbenders and Hilltoppers. After struggling with a walker who he punched through the torso and wall, he breaks free and is radioed by Lance regarding their status, and Romano replies that they have cleared their second location and heading towards the final spot. They approach a junkyard where the soldiers suspiciously split up, creating a perimeter around the three Alexandrians in the junkyard. However, the three men suddenly attack the soldiers, aware of an incoming ambush, and Daryl manages to subdue Romano, who falls to the ground after a hit to the face with Daryl's weapon. An injured and bloodied Romano attempts to crawl away after the four other soldiers in his group are killed by the Alexandrians. Daryl walks over to Romano and interrogates him for information, to which the injured trooper refuses to share anything. Daryl threatens to allow Romano to be eaten by a group of approaching undead, to which Romano gives in and gives information. Afterwards, Daryl fires a single bullet into Romano's head, killing him. His corpse is then devoured by the approaching walkers.","Killed By
