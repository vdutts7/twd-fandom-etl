Overview
[
]


Initially, Andy and 
Rick
's group start off on the wrong foot when 
Ethan
 stabs 
Gregory
 to save 
Craig
. This causes a fight, with Andy almost choking 
Abraham
 to death. After Rick kills Ethan, Andy is enraged. However, after he cools off and is asked by Rick to help take down the 
Saviors
, Andy agrees and lets go of his animosity. Andy plays a pivotal part during the 
Satellite Outpost
 raid, acting like they have Gregory's head, allowing the group to kill the two guards and storm the base. Andy goes on to become a member of the militia and shows much bravery until his death.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Andy's life prior to or as the outbreak began. 



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


Andy survived the early stages of the outbreak and took residence in a 
FEMA
 camp where he was later evacuated to a safe-zone named the 
Hilltop Colony
, upon where Andy settled into the farming community where he became integrated with the fellow residents, most notably 
Gregory
 and 
Paul Rovia
, and thus became a prominent member.

Andy was present at the time of the arrival of 
the Saviors
, a notorious group of survivors who demanded half of the Hilltop's supplies in exchange for leaving the farming community unscathed. Though initially reluctant to comply the Saviors demonstrated their motives through publicly executing a 16-year-old resident 
Rory
. Following this barbaric event, the colony entered into a period of dread and submission and thus were forced to comply under 
Negan
's rule, were due to their limited resources and manpower they were unable to rebel against their savage oppressors.

Throughout the following months, the community begrudgingly began to gather supplies to present towards the Saviors in their desperate attempt to keep them at bay. Andy was assigned as a member of a supply group tasked with routinely delivering a portion of supplies directed towards one of the Saviors compounds.

Approximately 20 months into the apocalypse, Andy was part of a supply exchange conducted between the Hilltop and the Saviors alongside 
Craig
, 
Crystal
, 
Ethan
, 
Tim
, and 
Marsha
. Upon delivering the supplies, Negan personally felt unsatisfied with the amount received and thus had both Tim and Marsha executed and Craig imprisoned at one of the Savior compounds. Negan ordered the remaining survivors to return to the Hilltop and, in exchange for Craig's release, kill Gregory and return back with his head as evidence of his death.



"
Knots Untie
"


Upon returning from the failed delivery, Andy watches as Ethan stabs Gregory and when 
Rick
 tackles Ethan he grabs at Rick but is tackled by 
Abraham
 and they start to fight. He gains the upper hand and starts to choke Abraham, but 
Daryl
 grabs him from behind and breaks his hand and throws him to the ground. He watches in horror from the ground as Rick stabs Ethan and starts yelling at Rick after Ethan's demise. After being patched up by Harlan, Andy is approached by Rick and is asked for assistance in dealing with the Saviors. He agrees and leaves with the newcomers to Alexandria.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"


When Rick and his group start planning their attack against the Saviors' outpost, Andy describes everything about the satellite station so they can draw out a map of the place. He then listens as Rick formulates his plan and leaves with the group to look for a walker head that looks somewhat like Gregory to use to fool the guards. When Rick punches one to break its nose as it looks different than Gregory's, Andy tells him that he's more frightening than the Saviors.

Later that night, Andy arrives outside the compound, gets out of the car with the walker head in the bag and yells to the two guards in front of the building that the deed is done. As one of the guards enters inside the compound to get the prisoner, Andy stares nervously at the remaining guard who is whistling until Daryl comes from behind and slits his throat. After the first guard comes out with 
Craig
, he is quickly killed by 
Michonne
 from behind. Andy then takes Craig back to the car for safety. When the alarm is set off, Andy and Craig drive away from the compound and back to the Hilltop.

Rock in the Road
"


When Enid convinces the Hilltop townspeople to joing the fight against the Saviors, Andy is among the residents to gather in front of the Barrington House and pledge allegiance to Rick and his crew, thanks to the recent efforts of 
Maggie
 and 
Sasha
, who saved the town from a walker attack that was started by the Saviors days earlier.

"
Mercy
"


Andy is among the 
militia
 to listen to the leaders' speeches before they launch their assault on the Sanctuary. As the others prepare for the upcoming assault, Andy gets nervous about fighting alongside so many strangers, 
Dianne
 calms him down stating that she will look out after him.  

Andy joins the militia as they launch their assault on the Sanctuary. He listens on to Gregory's attempt to dissuade the Hilltoppers from attacking the Saviors but they ignore his demands. After successfully ambushing the Saviors' headquarters, he and the others leave in their vehicles so that the incoming horde may swarm the factory.



"
The Damned
"


Andy is among the Hilltoppers to infiltrate the satellite outpost. While the militia position them outside doors and take out those inside, Andy stands in front of a door with 
Freddie
 and Morgan. When the door is opened, the Savior is killed but his friends open fire upon them. Andy is killed instantly while Freddie slowly dies of blood loss and Morgan is knocked unconscious. When Morgan later wakes up, he looks in shock at Andy's corpse.
