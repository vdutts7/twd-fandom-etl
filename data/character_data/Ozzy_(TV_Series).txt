Overview


Despite coming off as menacing and aggressive at first, Ozzy is neither unreasonable nor fundamentally malicious. Despite being a thief and extortionist, he avoids killing whenever possible, and prefers to obtain supplies through intimidation alone. This may also be out of pragmatism, since the Highwaymen don't appear to be a very large group and might not fare too well in an open conflict against a more numerous opponent. Ozzy also seems to be a man of his word, as he and his group faithfully protected the roads when they reached a deal with Ezekiel. To those he is allied with, Ozzy is courteous and friendly. Ozzy is also more than willing to protect his allies from harm as seen when he, alongside 
Alek
 and 
D.J.
 attempted to save the members of the 
Coalition
 after they were kidnapped and to be slaughtered by 
the Whisperers
, fighting valiantly before suffering a brutal death at the hands of 
Alpha
.



Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Ozzy's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse


At some point following the outbreak, Ozzy became leader of a group of survivors known as "
the Highwaymen
".



Season 9


"
Chokepoint
"


In their base, Ozzy greets 
Carol
, 
Ezekiel
, and 
Jerry
 as they enter. He informs them that the meeting is for the King alone. They disagree, and Ozzy asks if they have his toll, while his people approach with their weapons drawn. He suggests they use Ezekiel as ransom when suddenly the 
Kingdom
 fighters grab his people from behind. Ezekiel draws his sword and says he's prepared to fight for what they've created. He then offers Ozzy a job to clear the roads for him in exchange to access for the Kingdom and the fair. Ozzy laughs in his face and draws Jerry's sword, telling them they'll have to do better than that. Carol then asks when the last time they’ve seen a movie and a shocked Ozzy responds, 
"Seriously?"


Later, on the road, Ozzy and some of the Highwaymen ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara and the Hilltop group after helping them take down a herd. They then escort them to the Kingdom, having accepted Carol's deal. 

In the Kingdom, Ozzy walks around with his horse as he passes by Jerry. He then tips his hat and smiles to Carol and Ezekiel, signaling trust.



"
The Calm Before
"


In the woods, Ozzy, alongside 
Alek
 and 
D.J.
 help clear the road to keep the route to the Kingdom safe for the other communities. Later, he shows the others the site where 
Hilde
 was ambushed. The group decides to split up, with Ozzy and his group leaving to patrol the Kingdom's outskirts.

Later, he, Alek, and D.J. find the tied up residents surrounded by several Whisperers in a stable. They rush inside in an act of bravery and start attacking them, giving the group a chance to fight back. In the middle of the chaos, Alpha arrives and the group is subdued and then killed, only leaving 
Siddiq
 alive as a witness. Later, 
Alpha
 puts Ozzy's decapitated head on one of the several pikes used for the Whisperers' border.

The next day, 
Daryl
, 
Michonne
, Carol, Siddiq, and 
Yumiko
 find the border and watch in horror at the victims, a reanimated Ozzy being among them. 

Later, in the Kingdom, Siddiq delivers the tragic news to the crowd, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how they all fought back. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.

Quotes


The following is a list of some of Ozzy's most memorable quotes.



Season 9




"That wasn't the 
deal
. (…) You were supposed to bring me somethin'. (…) Well how about this for an alternative solution? If the Kingdom won't pay to use our roads, maybe they'll pay for 
you
."
- Ozzy threatening Ezekiel and his group, "
Chokepoint
"





"Is that supposed to be a 
joke
? (…) You're gonna have to do better than that."
- Ozzy turning down Ezekiel and Carol's offer, "
Chokepoint
"





"We're the Highwaymen. We're your 
escorts
 to the fair. At your 
service
."
- Ozzy introducing his group to Tara, "
Chokepoint
"





"We were clearing the roads, spotted tracks leading here. (…) Dead didn't do this. 
People did
. (…) We got the download. Strange times, strange ways to 
cope
. Anyway, yeah that'd be my guess. Anyone else was out here my patrols would've seen them. Something else, they'd put up a fight."
- Ozzy after finding an abandoned wagon and talking about the Whisperers, "
The Calm Before
"





"We'll keep up our patrols around the Kingdom. 
Just in case.
 'Course, this means 
you owe us
 a couple of movies when this is 
done
."
- Ozzy reminding Carol of their deal for his services, "
The Calm Before
"
