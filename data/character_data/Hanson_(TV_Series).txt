“


Did someone say something about him to you? (...) Well, you'll hear stories about him. About me. About what I did. He was my mentor. My friend. I miss him. That's the part the stories leave out. (...) They risk their lives, every time they go out there. Has to be worth it, has to matter. He lost sight of that, so he lost them. Beth, in this job you don't need their love. But you have to have their respect. Otherwise, the day's gonna come when you need backup and you don't have it. And what comes next? 
Everybody
 goes down.

Atlanta, Georgia
[

Hanson was a captain in the 
Atlanta Police Department
. His second-in-command was Lt. 
Dawn Lerner
 who, sometime before the outbreak, presented her an award for her work with the Atlanta Police Department.

Slabtown
"
[

Hanson was mentioned by Dr. 
Steven Edwards
 as the commanding officer who was tasked with evacuating 
Grady Memorial Hospital
 with Dawn Lerner and other Atlanta Police Department officers. After the city was firebombed, he eventually spiraled out of control, making bad decisions and was "dealt with" by Dawn. Hanson is later seen in a photograph in Dawn's office along with his nameplate and badge. According to the badge, his rank was Captain.

Hanson is mentioned by 
Beth Greene
 when she asked Dawn about his history and what had happened to him. Dawn replies that Hanson was her mentor. Later, Hanson is the topic for a quarrel between Dawn and
