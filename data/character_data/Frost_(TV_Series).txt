Overview
[
]


Frost is a loyal, defiant, and sarcastic individual. He is shown to be a faithful friend to 
Maggie
. After Frost is captured by the 
Reapers
, he is shown to be quite resilient. He is smart enough to go along with 
Daryl
's plan of acting like they don't know each other. Despite being brutally tortured and beaten, Frost doesn't break in revealing Maggie's groups location. Even when being tortured, he is shown to snarky, making many sarcastic quips towards the Reapers. He only gives into revealing Maggie's location after Daryl cuts his finger off. After Frost's death, it is left ambiguous whether he revealed Daryl's true allegiance or not. However, it is shown that he was loyal to the end as 
Pope
 never found out Daryl's true loyalties until his death.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Frost's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[

Season 11
[
]


"
Acheron: Part I
"
[
]


Upon 
Maggie
 and her group's return to 
Alexandria
 after their mission at 
Fort Connors
, she is overjoyed to see that Frost, along with 
Agatha
 and 
Duncan
, are alive and well. Later during a meeting, Maggie explains that Frost, Agatha, and Duncan were separated and believed to have been killed after 
Reapers
 attacked their 
village
. Frost and his fellow 
Wardens
 agree to accompany Maggie and a group of Alexandrians to Meridian to take out the Reapers and secure the food and water supplies to feed everyone in Alexandria.

Part of a group consisting of Maggie, 
Daryl
, 
Alden
, 
Cole
, 
Elijah
, 
Gage
, 
Negan
, Agatha, Duncan, 
Roy
, and 
Gabriel
, the survivors utilize Negan's familiarity with the 
D.C.
 area to travel to 
Meridian
. Due to the heavy 
rainstorm
, the survivors are forced to head into the 
subway tunnels
 to complete the journey. While in the tunnels, they come across hundreds of body bags, many containing walkers in them. At some point, while dispatching the body bag walkers, Gage and Roy go missing, along with the group's ammo and supplies. Shortly after this realization, a large group of walkers appear, forcing the other survivors to move forward in the tunnel without being able to search for Gage or Roy. He is able to make it into a subway car before the walkers are able to catch up with his group.



"
Acheron: Part II
"
[
]


Frost and the rest of the Meridian mission survivors make their way through the subway tunnels and successfully fight their way through the undead to safety, despite losing 
Gage
, who was killed after running away from the group and becoming separated. With the storm subsiding, Frost and the rest of the group traverse down a road when suddenly 
Roy
 is shot and killed and a flying knife severs Cole's hand clean. The Reapers have launched an ambush on the survivors.



"
Hunted
"
[
]


After the Reapers attack his group, Frost attempts to defend himself and avoid getting killed. With the members fragmented into smaller groups, Frost is nowhere to be found.



"
Rendition
"
[
]


After Daryl is captured by the Reapers, it is revealed that Frost was also captured by the Reapers and brought back to 
Meridian
. Frost is then tortured and interrogated by the Reapers. He attempts to get 
Daryl
 to say what happened to the others but Daryl shuts him down, saying he wants nothing to do with their fight. Frost, playing along, says his group should've let him starve, as he is taken away by the Reapers for more interrogation.



"
On the Inside
"
[
]


In Meridian, 
Carver
 tortures Frost and demands to know where his people are. Frost says nothing. 
Pope
 orders 
Daryl
 to take a turn interrogating Frost. Daryl puts Frost in a chokehold and orders him to give up his friends' location. Frost refuses. Daryl chops off Frost's finger and again demands to know the location of his friends. Frost finally reveals the 
location
 of the supply depot. Pope dispatches 
Leah
 to scout the location with a crew of Reapers. After they leave, Pope continued to interrogate Frost and got all the information he needed. After this, Pope tortured Frost to death. When Daryl and Leah return they see Frost tied to a post: he is now a walker.



"
No Other Way
"
[
]


While unseen, it can be assumed that either 
Maggie
, 
Daryl
, 
Gabriel
, or 
Negan
 put Frost down after the defeat of the Reapers, as it's unlikely they would've let their friend remain a walker forever.

, or
