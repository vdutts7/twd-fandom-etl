Overview
[
]


Tony is brutal and sadistic individual who went along with his group's heinous acts. He has no qualms with stealing and murdering other survivors. He is shown to be quite cruel, at one point holding down a thief's hand for 
Joe
 to chop off. He helps beat up 
Len
 who was deemed a traitor without hesitation. While holding 
Michonne
 at gunpoint, he implies he will most likely rape her after 
Carl
. However, after 
Rick
 kills Joe, Tony becomes distracted allowing Michonne to shoot Tony with his own gun.



Pre-Apocalypse

"
Claimed
"


Tony, along with other men, arrive at the house that 
Rick Grimes
 is staying in. He is first heard downstairs along with his fellow group members apparently either torturing or murdering a man they have been holding captive. Once arriving upstairs and securing the bedroom Rick has been occupying, he gets into a brawl with one of his fellow group members, Len, over Rick's bed and is held in a choke-hold. However before passing out, he catches a glimpse of Rick under the bed and tries in between gasps to inform Len but he does not listen and Tony then passes out.



"
Alone
"


Tony is first seen with his group gathering around 
Daryl Dixon
, while Daryl is sitting down in the middle of a road. After Daryl punches Joe and points his ready-to-fire 
crossbow
 at 
Joe
, Tony and the other group members point their guns at Daryl. After Joe talks Daryl into lowering his crossbow, Tony and the other group members lower their guns too.



"
Us
"


Tony is first seen sleeping on the ground in the forest, as a 
walker
 approaches, he wakes up and watches 
Harley
 kill it. He along with the rest of the group walks along the tracks, as a walker roams up to them, he distracts the walker and pushes it to 
Dan
. 
Billy
 then stabs it in the head. As they walk along the tracks, Joe tells them to take shelter in the car shed, he aims his gun and clears out the shed. As the group are checking the place out he claims one of the cars. The next morning he watches as 
Len
 confronts Daryl and Len is deemed a liar. He is seen sitting in the car he claimed, eating food. He gathers around Joe, Len and Daryl with the rest of the group. He along with Harley, Billy and Dan are ordered by Joe to beat up and kill Len. Tony starts kicking Len as he is on the ground. They later shoot a arrow into Len's head, killing him. He leaves the shed and walks along the tracks, as he finds a strawberry plant he is about to claim it but is too late as Daryl claims it before him. As they find a 
Terminus
 sign, Joe says that they have been tracking down a man who killed Lou and that Tony was the only one who saw his face.



"

"


Joe and his group ambush Rick, 
Michonne
, and 
Carl
 while they camp close to Terminus. Tony is seen holding Michonne at gunpoint with his .44 
Smith & Wesson Model 29
 revolver. As Rick and Joe fight, Michonne attempts to grab or deflect Tony's revolver but fails. After Rick bites Joe's neck, Tony (along with everyone else) is shocked and turns to Rick. Tony lowers his guard and this allows Michonne to take the opportunity to grab Tony's hand, forcing it back towards his head and firing his revolver, shooting him in the head and killing him.
