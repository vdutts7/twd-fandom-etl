Wake up, everybody! There isn't any herd, there isn't any deal waiting back at Hilltop. 
You think these ass-wipes came here to save us? They came here for blood.
 Hell, 
this one
 
strangled
 one of his 
own guys
 to death with his own hands! All Rick is saying here, 
is a steaming pile of bullshit.

Overview
[
]


Jared can be summarized as a bully in every sense of the word; an obnoxious, violent, boorish, brazen, spiteful, and seemingly compassionless man who takes every opportunity to physically and mentally abuse people for amusement and who appears to be completely devoid of empathy for other human beings. Unlike most of his fellow 
Saviors
, who generally had some positive aspect to their personalities, or at the very least, understandable motivations, Jared seemed to have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, never once showing the slightest bit of concern or genuine respect for anyone except himself. He is shown to take great pleasure in terrorizing, taunting and antagonizing the people of 
the Kingdom
 and seems to have a particular dislike of 
Richard
, starting a fight or argument on each of their meetings. He also has no respect for property, as seen when he stole 
Morgan
's fighting stick. Jared appears to be a sadist, as he smirked while shooting 
Benjamin
 in the leg and seemed greatly amused by the subsequent pain and anguish this caused the people of the Kingdom, took delight in cruelly mocking Morgan over Benjamin's subsequent death and later says "music to my ears" with a smile as Hilltop members were screaming while being devoured by walkers, further showing Jared's lack of empathy and remorse towards other people. It was Jared's violent, vicious and bullying behavior towards the people of the Kingdom (and his cold-blooded murder of Benjamin) that motivated them to aid the people of 
Alexandria
 and 
the Hilltop
 in their fight against the Saviors.

Jared is quite different from most of his fellow Saviors, who generally do what they feel they have to do to survive, while Jared takes visible delight in his violence, and subsequently has a poor relationship with his superior 
Gavin
, who although tolerant of Jared's bullying has a very low opinion of him for it, although after learning that Benjamin had died of the gunshot injury Jared had inflicted Gavin reached the end of his tether and threatened to kill Jared himself should the latter answer him back. Jared's antisocial behavior is in sharp contrast to Gavin's, as the latter is a more reasonable and civil man. Jared was possibly the most morally bankrupt, unsavory, heartless and depraved of all the Saviors; while 
Negan
 genuinely believed he was saving people, and even the more sadistic 
Simon
 believed he was acting in the best interests of the group, both seeing their ruthless behavior as justified, Jared never once looked out for anyone except himself and the sole reason for his violent and murderous actions was the twisted, sadistic joy he got from victimizing other people. 

When the tables are turned on Jared however, he shows himself to be a coward. Although he arrogantly didn't believe the 
Militia
 would harm any of the 39 Saviors (Jared among them) they took captive, having clearly gotten used to getting away with his violent, bullying behavior without any consequences, he was shocked when 
Maggie
 proved him wrong by killing 
Dean
 and from that moment onwards became very withdrawn whenever she was around, doing his best not to attract her attention, having clearly realized for the first time that he actually may not survive after all. When confronted with an armed 
Henry
 looking for his brother's killer in "
Do Not Send Us Astray
", Jared pathetically tried to hide behind another Savior, mostly unsuccessfully due to Jared's size compared to the smaller man. In his final moments in "
Still Gotta Mean Something
", when he is trapped by walkers, he quickly resorts to begging and pleading for Morgan to save him even though he certainly wouldn't have done the same had it been the other way around (having been willing to kill him just moments before) and never once showed anyone the slightest bit of the mercy he begged Morgan to show him in his final moments, dying the pathetic and disgraceful person he always was.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Jared's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Jared somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined.

Jared aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.

Content








"
The Well
"


Jared is among a group of Saviors led by 
Gavin
 in charge of collecting weekly offerings from 
the Kingdom
. During that week's offering, he gets into a fight with 
Richard
 and proceeds to punch him several times before being ordered off of him by Gavin. Before he lets Richard go, Jared gives him the middle finger and then leaves with his fellow Saviors.



"
New Best Friends
"


The following week, Jared and his group of Saviors arrive at their pickup location for their supplies. Still feeling resentful for their previous fight, Jared says that he wants Richard's gun and the two men face off. Ezekiel tells Richard to hand over his gun, which he reluctantly does. When Jared lunges at Richard, Morgan strikes him with his staff. Jared seizes the 
staff
 and hits Richard and Morgan with it, so Benjamin strikes Jared and sends him to the floor. After their fight is diffused once again, Jared keeps Morgan's staff to himself as he leaves with his group.



"
Bury Me Here
"


Jared and his fellow Saviors are waiting for the Kingdommers to show up for their weekly supply drop. He is playing around with Morgan's stick and mocks Richard when they finally arrive. After the Kingdom soldiers hand over their weapons due to a missing cantaloupe, Gavin gives Jared permission to kill Richard as punishment like he previously stated. However, Jared shoots 
Benjamin
 in the leg instead. This angers Gavin who orders Jared to return Morgan's 
staff
. 

The next day, Jared and the Saviors return for the missing cantaloupe. After learning that Benjamin has died, Gavin becomes upset and furiously orders Jared to start walking back to their outpost without saying a word or doing anything to spark another issue, threatening to kill him if he did so. Jared complies and walks away from the exchange in embarrassment for being scolded. While leaving, he watches as Morgan strangles Richard to death.





Season 8

"
The Damned
"


As punishment for having disobeyed Gavin's orders and killed Benjamin in cold blood, Jared is transferred to the 
Satellite Outpost
 days before the war. During 
the Militia
 attack on the outpost, Jared is among the Saviors who surrender. When 
Morgan
 emerges from the outpost after having killed multiple Saviors, he and Jared recognize each other. Morgan holds a gun to Jared's heart, but is talked down from killing Jared by 
Jesus
 as Jared had surrendered.



"
Monsters
"


Jared is among the Saviors being transported to the 
Hilltop
. Along the way, he annoys and taunts Morgan over the death of Benjamin to the point of Morgan pointing a gun at him. When walkers attack, Jared and his group escape into the woods. Morgan eventually catches up to them and right before Morgan kills Jared, Jesus stops him. After arriving at the Hilltop, the captured Saviors are let inside and corralled into two trailers in the back of the settlement.



"
The King, the Widow, and Rick
"


Jared is with the other captured Saviors sitting outside the Hilltop as their fates are discussed. Ultimately, Jared is allowed inside of the gates in a makeshift prison when Maggie chooses to side with 
Jesus
 over 
Gregory
. While being escorted inside of the prison, he attempts to escape but Maggie stops him and knocks him with the butt of her rifle. Shortly after, Jared tries once again to escape by using a piece of wood to cut through the binds around his wrists but 
Alden
 bumps him, causing him to drop the wood as he wants to avoid causing any more trouble.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


Jared and the other Saviors remain in the prison when Maggie demands Dean to be let out. He watches as Alden attempts to dissuade Maggie from what she's about to do, but Maggie suddenly shoots Dean in the face, killing him. Jared and the others watch on as Maggie threatens Alden and Dean's body is taken away.



"
Dead or Alive Or
"


Jared makes a ruckus while the Savior prisoners are being watched over by 
Morgan
 and 
Henry
. As a result, Henry demands to know which one killed 
his brother
 though Jared doesn't answer. When 
Maggie
 arrives at the prisoner pen later that day, Jared quickly scurries to the back in apparent fear of Maggie's potential wrath.



"
Do Not Send Us Astray
"


When the 
Saviors
 arrive at 
the Hilltop
, 
Maggie
 brings out the Savior prisoners and threatens to kill each one if the Saviors don't leave. However, 
Simon
 makes it clear that he doesn't care if the prisoners live or die, stunning Jared. As the Saviors prepare to attack, he is sent back inside along with the other prisoners.

The night after the attack, an armed 
Henry
 arrives at the pen and opens the gate, demanding to know which Savior killed his brother and threatening to kill everyone if the killer doesn't step forward. Jared gets scared and tries to hide behind another Savior, when suddenly an injured savior reanimates and attacks the rest of the prisoners, allowing Jared to push Henry and take his weapon, leading the other prisoners away.



"
Still Gotta Mean Something
"


Having taken refuge inside an 
abandoned dive bar
 after some of their companions are bitten by walkers, Jared and his companions use their amputated limbs as a distraction to capture 
Rick
 and 
Morgan
 and take them hostage. With injured comrades, the Saviors argue over what to do, particularly as Rick reveals that a 
herd
 is on the way. Jared insists on killing them and to head to the 
Sanctuary
 when Rick offers the Saviors a chance to return to the 
Hilltop
 and join the community, which most consider though Jared refuses to believe the offer.

As the herd attacks the bar, Jared tries to kill Rick and Morgan, but is thrown to the ground by another Savior and disarmed before the Savior is eaten by a walker. As Jared attempts to flee, Morgan chases him and they start fighting until Jared briefly gains the upper hand and tries to kill Morgan with a sharp stick. However, Morgan kicks Jared off of him and into a hallway that walkers are coming down. He then closes a grate, grabs Jared by his jacket and holds him against the gate as Jared begs to be let go. As the walkers bite Jared on the face multiple times, Morgan eventually lets go of him and watches as Jared gets dragged back and fully devoured, putting an end to his terror and cowardly ways.



"
Wrath
"


When Morgan kills a 
surrendering Savior
 at a roadblock, he hallucinates seeing a partially devoured Jared who begins to mock Morgan for his brutal killing until Jesus snaps Morgan back into reality.

Trivia
[
]


Jared's death is very reminiscent of 
Jimmy
's, 
T-Dog
's, 
Noah
's, 
David
's, and 
Paula
's deaths in the fact that all are eaten alive by walkers by a door/fence while another character(s) is able to escape and live. Also, most of them were initially bitten around the face/neck area.


Joshua Mikel
 also played a 
walker
 in the 
season 2
 finale "
Beside the Dying Fire
".


Jared is shown to be a very weak fighter, despite his brutal personality. This is shown when he is easily overpowered and countered by Richard, and even by Morgan despite cheapshotting him and nearly killing him, is easily overpowered and later killed.


In "The Damned" as Morgan reaches the outside of the outpost where the Saviors are rounded up, Jared can be seen holding a rifle. Several seconds later as he speaks to Morgan, his rifle is missing.


During an interview, 
Joshua Mikel
 states that he had auditioned on the Walking Dead fifteen times before landing the part of Jared.
[1]


Joshua Mikel has stated that he found Jared's long hair extremely obnoxious and often asked the writers if there could be a scene where his hair gets cut off. On the other hand, he also says there are benefits, such as helping him get more roles as bad guys due to his villainous look.
