, she is extremely grateful to her and decides to join her on her mission to find 
Rick
, despite being given a safer alternative in going to 
Alexandria
. She initially is optimistic about her chances in finding Rick. However, in her last moments as she is dying, she tells Michonne that she should give up on finding Rick for her own safety.

"
What We Become
"
[

As 
Michonne Grimes
 and her pet walkers trudge through the wilderness, Aiden and an injured 
Bailey
 suddenly emerge from the trees, startled to see Michonne. They cower in uncertainty and fear at first but Aiden pleads for help from Michonne, indicating they need to re-group with their caravan seen in the distance. She states that they need help and the caravan won't wait for them, to which Michonne agrees. After dispatching of her pet walkers, she assists Aiden and the injured man and begin the trek to meet up with caravan.

"
Gone
"
[
]


Aiden, Bailey, and Michonne succeeded in getting back to the caravan and enter a meeting with Aiden's sister, 
Elle
. Elle annoys Michonne by trying to get her to a join a community, leading to Aiden telling her to just give Michonne a horse like she requested. 
Nat
 storms in and confronts Elle about leaving Aiden and Bailey behind. However, Aiden catches Nat's attention and the three are happily reunited. Bailey explains Michonne saved them after he hurt his ankle.

Later, Aiden and Bailey bring Michonne Elle's horse which is one of the best. Nat pleads with Michonne to spend the night so that he can properly equip her and show Michonne how to use the equipment properly. Michonne agrees and an excited Nat starts giving Aiden and Bailey orders on crafting something while he walks Michonne through the 
screamsticks
.

The next morning, Aiden expresses faith that Michonne is going to find Rick as she found Bailey. Michonne tells Aiden, Bailey and Nat that she's glad to have met them and they wish each other luck before Aiden and Bailey leave. 

As Michonne is faced with a giant herd, two explosions go off and the herd splits, each half going towards one of the explosions, which opens the path for Michonne. Turning around, Michonne finds several of the caravan's vehicles and Aiden and Bailey leading Michonne's horse back over to her. Bailey explains that they were tired of the carvan's rules and left with others who felt the same way to look for her. Aiden tells Michonne to wait with them while the horde splits, stating that the fires are going to burn on either side of the valley for awhile.

At night, Nat explains how Bailey and Aiden had wanted to go after Michonne which he finds to be insane, but they'd had enough. Michonne thanks her friends, and Bailey thanks her in turn for waking them up, calling it a big move for himself and Aiden. Michonne promises Aiden, Bailey, and Nat that when she gets Rick, they will all come home with her to Alexandria.

Bailey goes to get Aiden some food over her objections, which leads to Michonne realizing that Aiden is 
pregnant
. Aiden explains that she had been craving honey, which was why Bailey had been out there when Michonne found him and Aiden. Aiden starts crying, and Michonne comforts her, suggesting that Aiden and Bailey should head for Alexandria immediately with some of the others. However, Aiden tells Michonne that they will go there after she finds Rick.

As the group stops to clear an obstacle, a 
CRM
 helicopter flies overhead and drops 
Chlorine Gas
 bombs on the town. Recognizing the deadly gas, Nat yells orders for everyone to cover their mouths with fabric and to wet it with their canteens. Nat's Group quickly falls victim to the gas, dying and reanimating. Struggling to breathe in the toxic cloud, Nat picks the lock on 
an abandoned mall
 and Michonne, Aiden, Bailey, and Nat enter. Aiden is the most effected by the chlorine gas and the three of them help her into a bed. Barely alive, Aiden weakly tells Michonne to go back to her children and not to take the risk of looking for Rick. With everyone struggling to breathe, Michonne decides to check out a nearby medical plaza in the hopes of finding some oxygen tanks. Knowing that Aiden has a low chance of survival, Michonne orders Bailey to find something to tie his girlfriend to the bed, warning him not to fall asleep next to her.

Michonne returns to the mall with a cart full of oxygen tanks, only to find that Aiden has died and reanimated while she was gone, blood covering her mouth and the pillow next to her. Devastated, Michonne stabs her friend in the head with her sword.
