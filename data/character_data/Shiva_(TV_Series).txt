I was a zookeeper. Shiva, she 
fell into one of the concrete moats
 in her exhibit. It was empty, the vets were on their way, but her leg was ripped open. 
She was gonna bleed out.
 The sound she made; she was in so much pain. I knew the 
risk
. I 
had to
 try. And I got my shirt up around her leg, 
saved her life
. After that, she never showed so much as a tooth in my direction. Keeping a tiger isn't practical, I know. She eats as much as ten people. She could yank the chain out of my hand.  Hell, she could yank my arm 
right off
. But she hasn't. She won't.

Overview
[
]


Shiva is a loyal, brave, and domesticated tiger. Before the outbreak, Shiva fell into a concrete moat and badly injured her leg. 
Ezekiel
, who was just a worker, jumped in and saved Shiva, something she was quite grateful for, and because of this never showed any aggression or hostility towards Ezekiel. Generally, tigers are unable to be tamed under most circumstances since they are solitary animals, making Shiva an anomaly among others.  To her allies, Shiva is friendly and non-aggressive and is able to distinguish friend from foe. To her enemies, Shiva is ferocious and unrelenting. Right before 
Negan
 is about to kill 
Carl
, Shiva saves him by jumping on a 
Scavenger
 and kills him.

Later, most of the 
Kingdom
 soldiers are slaughtered leaving Ezekiel, 
Jerry
, and 
Carol
 as the only survivors. Due to Ezekiel's injury, they are forced to go at a rather slow pace, allowing walkers to catch up. Right as it seems Ezekiel will sacrifice himself, Shiva jumps in and saves her owner, fighting off the walkers so the three can escape. However, this costs her life and the walkers proceed to devour her. Years after her death, Shiva is still remembered fondly and is a symbol of the Kingdom's strength. In "
New Haunts
", it's revealed that Ezekiel reveals still possesses Shiva's leash, and gives it to 
Ezra
 as a gift.

Trivia
[
]


Shiva is 
The Walking Dead
'
s first and only character that is not portrayed by a live actor. However, her actions are created by visual CGI effects embedded on a stuntman in a blue suit.


Shiva is both the first animal to kill living survivors and walkers on-screen.


In the episode "
Chokepoint
", the 
Kingdom
 is shown to have a banner and stuffed tiger on display in memorial to Shiva.


Shiva is the first animal character in the series to appear in more than one season.


In the episode "
New Haunts
", it is revealed that 
Ezekiel
 still possesses Shiva's leash, although he later decides to gift it to 
Ezra
 as a present.

The same episode features 
Jerry
, Ezra and 
Aliyah
 dressed up as tigers for Halloween, presumably in homage to Shiva.


Shiva appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".
