,,,Nothing is known about Colton's life prior to or as the outbreak began.,"At some point in the apocalypse, Colton joined a community called 
the Kingdom
 where he became one of the soldiers.
Colton and 
Daniel
 stumble across Morgan and 
Carol
 shortly after 
Roman
's death and Morgan tells them that he has their horse and asks for their help in saving Carol, who was stabbed previously by 
Jiro
 and shot in the arm and leg by Roman. They agree and the group leaves together.
Colton helps transport Carol to the Kingdom with Daniel and Morgan until a group of walkers attack them. Just as they are getting overwhelmed, 
Richard
 and other Kingdom soldiers arrive in time to dispatch the walkers and save Colton's group.
Dozens of Kingdom fighters are slaughtered by an .M2 Browning machine gun used by the Saviors at the 
chemical plant outpost
