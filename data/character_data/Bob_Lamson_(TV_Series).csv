,,,"Bob seems to be a manipulative and cowardly man. After he, Amanda Shepherd , and Licari are captured, he seems to be reasonable and cooperates with Rick 's group. However, he later tricks Sasha and escapes. As Bob runs back to the Grady Memorial Hospital , Rick pursues him in a car and tells him to stop. However, Bob foolishly ignores him and keeps running. This causes Rick to hit Bob with his car, crippling him. In his last moments, Bob tells Rick that his group's gonna die before Rick shoots him in the head. Despite what was shown of him, it's later stated by Noah that Bob was ""one of the good ones,"" meaning he hadn't become corrupted like some of the other cops. This indicates that Bob's actions may have been done out of fear rather than malicious intent. However, it was ultimately Bob's foolishness that got him killed in the end.","Little is known about Bob's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was an officer with the Atlanta Police Department and had worked closely with Dawn Lerner for several years. He also had at least one child, a son. It is unknown if his child is dead.","When the outbreak first started, Bob was one of several officers under Dawn Lerner assigned to evacuate Grady Memorial Hospital . He was originally going to drive the last load of patients to the evacuation zone. When Dawn receives reports of gunshots from one of her lookouts, she assigns Bob to investigate, along with Officer Amanda Shepherd . Following the shots, they eventually find Noah , whom they corner and begin taking into custody. Before they can, the two are confronted by survivor Rick Grimes and his group, who have them surrender their weapons and bind their wrists. However, another officer, Licari , surprises the group and gives Bob and Shepherd an opportunity to escape. The attempt is short lived, as the car gets stuck in the charred evacuation zone, and all three officers are captured. Bob and the other officers are taken to a warehouse Rick used as a base of operations. He expresses that he wants to resolve the issue of Beth Greene and Carol Peletier without violence, and offers to tell Rick about Dawn in order to smooth the future negotiations. Bob later laments to Sasha Williams about seeing an undead Tyler, an old friend of his, at the evacuation point, and she offers to put him down for the officer. However, as she takes aim at the walker, Bob forcefully runs into her, knocking her unconscious, and flees the building. Bob opens the episode fleeing for Grady Memorial Hospital, attempting to cut his bonds in the process. He is interrupted by a pursuing Rick, commanding him to stop through the police car's speakers. Bob refuses to comply, continuing to run away until Rick drives directly into him. After he gets hit by the car, the impact seemingly breaks his back and cripples him. As he is begging for his life, Rick says to him, ""Can't go back, Bob,"" and that all he had to do was stop. When Bob begins to say that Rick's group will all die, Rick shoots him in the head. Rick then tells his corpse to shut up and leaves as walkers close in. After Bob's death, Licari and Amanda Shepherd both agree to tell Dawn that Lamson fell victim to walkers rather than the truth - a plan they ultimately fulfill during the prisoner exchange. All three officers are upset by Lamson's death, stating that he was ""one of the good ones,"" indicating that Lamson was one of the morally virtuous cops at the hospital, who hadn't been corrupted by power or abused his position to take advantage of people.","Killed By Himself (Caused) Rick Grimes After tricking and knocking out Sasha, Bob attempts to flee back to the hospital. As he tries to cut his bonds, he is spotted by Rick who takes up his police car and chases him down. Refusing to comply with Rick's repeated demand to stop, he is significantly injured when Rick drives the vehicle directly into him, potentially breaking his back. Bob begs for his life, but after being denied medical attention, promises that they all will die when attempting to trade prisoners with Dawn. Rick abruptly shoots him in the head and then tells his corpse to ""shut up"".",This list shows the victims Bob has killed: Himself (Caused) Numerous counts of zombies and possibly unnamed people,"For a more in-depth look at Bob's relationships, read here: Bob Lamson (TV Series)/Relationships",,,"Lamson's death is very similar to Caesar Martínez 's death from the Comic Series. However, while Lamson was shot in the head by Rick, Martínez was strangled to death. Lamson says ""I think I'm getting an idea"" as Rick stands over him, a slight remix of the quote said by Caesar as he's being strangled to death by Rick. In a deleted scene for "" Crossed "", Amanda Shepherd expresses discontent with Dawn Lerner 's leadership and she suggests that Lamson is the perfect person to take over in Dawn's stead. However, he is uninterested and their discussion is interrupted by the sound of a gunshot. Lamson is one of four characters to be monoplegic, as he is able to move his left foot moments after being hit by a car. The other characters with this distinction are a zombified Phil , who is able to move his right leg despite having a beam going through his lower spine, Melvin , who is able to move his right leg after the explosion, and Donnie , who lost the ability to move his left arm after he was shot."
