Overview


Bob seems to be a manipulative and cowardly man. After he, 
Amanda Shepherd
, and 
Licari
 are captured, he seems to be reasonable and cooperates with 
Rick
's group. However, he later tricks 
Sasha
 and escapes. As Bob runs back to the 
Grady Memorial Hospital
, Rick pursues him in a car and tells him to stop. However, Bob foolishly ignores him and keeps running. This causes Rick to hit Bob with his car, crippling him. In his last moments, Bob tells Rick that his group's gonna die before Rick shoots him in the head.

Despite what was shown of him, it's later stated by 
Noah
 that Bob was 
"one of the good ones,"
 meaning he hadn't become corrupted like some of the other cops. This indicates that Bob's actions may have been done out of fear rather than malicious intent. However, it was ultimately Bob's foolishness that got him killed in the end.



Pre-Apocalypse


Atlanta, Georgia


Little is known about Bob's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was an officer with the 
Atlanta Police Department
 and had worked closely with 
Dawn Lerner
 for several years. He also had at least one child, a son. It is unknown if his child is dead.



Post-Apocalypse


When the outbreak first started, Bob was one of several officers under 
Dawn Lerner
 assigned to evacuate 
Grady Memorial Hospital
. He was originally going to drive the last load of patients to the evacuation zone.



Season 5


"
Crossed
"


When Dawn receives reports of gunshots from one of her lookouts, she assigns Bob to investigate, along with Officer 
Amanda Shepherd
. Following the shots, they eventually find 
Noah
, whom they corner and begin taking into custody. Before they can, the two are confronted by survivor 
Rick Grimes
 and his group, who have them surrender their weapons and bind their wrists. However, another officer, 
Licari
, surprises the group and gives Bob and Shepherd an opportunity to escape. The attempt is short lived, as the car gets stuck in the charred evacuation zone, and all three officers are captured.

Bob and the other officers are taken to a warehouse Rick used as a base of operations. He expresses that he wants to resolve the issue of 
Beth Greene
 and 
Carol Peletier
 without violence, and offers to tell Rick about Dawn in order to smooth the future negotiations.

Bob later laments to 
Sasha Williams
 about seeing an undead Tyler, an old friend of his, at the evacuation point, and she offers to put him down for the officer. However, as she takes aim at the walker, Bob forcefully runs into her, knocking her unconscious, and flees the building.



"
Coda
"


Bob opens the episode fleeing for Grady Memorial Hospital, attempting to cut his bonds in the process. He is interrupted by a pursuing Rick, commanding him to stop through the police car's speakers. Bob refuses to comply, continuing to run away until Rick drives directly into him. After he gets hit by the car, the impact seemingly breaks his back and cripples him. As he is begging for his life, Rick says to him, "Can't go back, Bob," and that all he had to do was stop. When Bob begins to say that Rick's group will all die, Rick shoots him in the head. Rick then tells his corpse to shut up and leaves as walkers close in.

After Bob's death, 
Licari
 and 
Amanda Shepherd
 both agree to tell Dawn that Lamson fell victim to walkers rather than the truth - a plan they ultimately fulfill during the prisoner exchange. All three officers are upset by Lamson's death, stating that he was 
"one of the good ones,"
 indicating that Lamson was one of the morally virtuous cops at the hospital, who hadn't been corrupted by power or abused his position to take advantage of people.

Rick Grimes


After tricking and knocking out Sasha, Bob attempts to flee back to the hospital. As he tries to cut his bonds, he is spotted by Rick who takes up his police car and chases him down. Refusing to comply with Rick's repeated demand to stop, he is significantly injured when Rick drives the vehicle directly into him, potentially breaking his back. 

Bob begs for his life, but after being denied medical attention, promises that they all will die when attempting to trade prisoners with Dawn. Rick abruptly shoots him in the head and then tells his corpse to 
"shut up".

Quotes




The following is a list of some of Bob's most memorable quotes.



Season 5




"You let me know if it's too tight, okay?"
- Bob as he cuffs Noah "
Crossed
"





"Where are those rotters you were shooting at?"
- Bob to Noah before realizing they were tricked, "
Crossed
"





"Mind if I ask you something? The way you 
talk
, the way you 
carry yourself
. Were you a cop?"
- Bob asking Rick if he was a cop, "
Crossed
"





"We can make this work, but you gotta be able to talk to her. I've known her for 8 years ma'am. I know this woman, and my only interest is 
peaceful resolution
, not dying, and sleeping in my bed tonight. So, please, let me help you."
- Bob to the group about Dawn, "
Crossed
"





"She'll tell you she won't compromise, but she will. She always does."
- Bob to Rick about Dawn, "
Crossed
"





"No. No, the real ones are all 
gone
."
- Bob after Rick tells him he's still a cop, "
Crossed
"





"When you were bringing us back up here, I saw a rotter. I saw one of the rotters and I knew him. His name was Tyler. I met him in Grady. We were both set there when shit started going down. Took two whole days to evacuate everyone. Didn't sleep, we didn't eat. Still it was... the two best days of my life. I was supposed to drive the last van of survivors to the zone, then Dawn pulled me off. She wanted someone she could really trust and she put Tyler on it instead. These people were gonna all be evacuated and were really 
pissed
. I saw him out there. Stuck out there, melted to the asphalt and all I could think was... that would've been me. Would've been me, he saved me life. He's been out there the whole time, like he's a part of the street. Some screwed-up, endless 
joke
... and there's nothing I can do about it."
- Bob to Sasha about his friend, Tyler, "
Crossed
"





"Oh 
shit!
"
- Bob before Rick rams a car into him, "
Coda
"





"I don't know you, but I think I'm getting an idea... Take me back to the hospital. I did it for your friend... I was gonna iron it over. She's under it. And you've been out here too long. You'll 
die
. You'll all—"
- Bob's last words to Rick, shortly before Rick shoots him, "

Trivia


Lamson's death is very similar to 
Caesar Martínez
's death from the Comic Series. However, while Lamson was shot in the head by Rick, Martínez was strangled to death.

Lamson says "I think I'm getting an idea" as Rick stands over him, a slight remix of the quote said by Caesar as he's being strangled to death by Rick.


In a deleted scene for "
Crossed
", 
Amanda Shepherd
 expresses discontent with 
Dawn Lerner
's leadership and she suggests that Lamson is the perfect person to take over in Dawn's stead. However, he is uninterested and their discussion is interrupted by the sound of a gunshot.


Lamson is one of four characters to be monoplegic, as he is able to move his left foot moments after being hit by a car.

The other characters with this distinction are a zombified 
Phil
, who is able to move his right leg despite having a beam going through his lower spine, 
Melvin
, who is able to move his right leg after the explosion, and 
Donnie
, who lost the ability to move his left arm after he was shot.
