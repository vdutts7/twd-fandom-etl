You saw how we were

Tara
, the two were separated. Heath was later captured by the 
Scavengers

Overview
[
]


Heath has been described as an intelligent, cynical, and serious-minded guy with a level of disbelief and dislike for the stupidity he often encounters. The only thing he has that passes for humor is his occasional sarcasm. He is not angry or ill-tempered; he just thinks that people can be (and often are) very dumb. If pressed, he would reluctantly admit that he thinks most people have the potential to be good.  

Heath represents the divide between that of the Alexandrians and 
Rick Grimes
' group, as, despite his experience in supply runs, he has not yet faced the horrific circumstances that Rick and his group have experienced, causing some friction between the two groups.  

Despite this, Heath has proven to show great care, determination, and loyalty towards his fellow survivors as shown by refusing to leave 
Scott
 and 
Annie
 behind and generally believes in safety in numbers.

Heath, like Glenn, was shown to be very hesitant to kill another living person, as he was initially unable to do so when they raided the Savior's compound. Seeing his hesitation, Glenn, who had just killed a person for the first time, did it for him rather than force Heath to try to bring himself to do it. But, he later showed that he is willing to kill, but it was only done in the heat of the moment when he was almost killed. Unlike the man he couldn't bring himself to kill, it was in self-defense rather than while his victims were sleeping.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[

Nothing is known about Heath's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


From the early start of the outbreak, Heath had been participating in supply runs providing him with the knowledge and capability to operate in severe situations.

At some point later, Heath made his way to the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where he settled into the community, and upon being interviewed by 
Deanna Monroe
 he was officially assigned as a supply runner alongside 
Scott
 and 
Annie
 of whom the three became close friends as well as a prominent supply run team and thus became an effective asset to the community. During an early scouting Heath's team was assigned to survey the area around Alexandria where they discovered a large camp near a quarry which had been overrun with around 'a dozen' walkers which had been blocked by several trucks.

Season 6
[

Content








"
First Time Again
"


Heath makes his first appearance in this episode, overlooking the quarry with the rest of Rick's assembled team and listening to his plan of attack for the following day. He witnesses one of the trucks falling into the quarry, releasing the herd, and races off with 
Glenn Rhee
 and 
Nicholas
 as the plan is put into immediate effect.

During a series of flashbacks, it is shown that Heath had been out on a weeks-long supply run with fellow runners 
Scott
 and 
Annie
 since before Rick's group's arrival at the community. When Eugene opens the inner gate, Heath shows confusion at his presence, but manages to convince him that they are community members and to open the gate.

During the following days, Heath is present for Rick's proposed plan of herding the walkers in the quarry out and away from the community to minimize risks. He is among the many volunteers for the mission, and is tasked with clearing the nearby tractor store with Glenn and Nicholas in order to keep the herd on the set path.

In the present, Heath, Glenn and Nicholas clear out the tractor store and head back to the group on the road, overlooking the progress being made on the plan. After the herd reaches the final checkpoint, a loud truck horn is heard blaring in the distance, drawing the back half of the herd in the direction of Alexandria. Heath, along with the rest of the group, heads back ahead of the herd.



"
Thank You
"


Heath is seen with the main group as they make their way back to Alexandria following the truck horn. Along the way, he overhears Rick conversing with Glenn and 
Michonne
, informing them of the Alexandrians' inexperience and telling them to leave them behind should they not be able to keep up. The entire group witnesses 
Barnes
 getting devoured before he is put down by Michonne.

The group splits, with Heath joining Glenn, Michonne, Nicholas, Scott, Annie, 
David
 and 
Sturgess
. After dealing with a small group of walkers, the group continues on in search of a working vehicle until they happen upon a small town; Heath recognizes the town as the location of Nicholas and 
Aiden Monroe
's failed supply run, and reluctantly appoints Nicholas as their guide.

After finding Sturgess' hat, they come across Sturgess himself (who had left the group in fear during the earlier walker attack) being devoured by walkers. Retracing their steps, the group finds themselves surrounded in all directions and retreat into a nearby pet store, where they discuss their next move. Heath stays behind with the rest of the group while Glenn and Nicholas devise a plan to distract the walkers by burning down the feed store.

After Heath tends to Scott's injuries and attempts to help Annie, he and Michonne discuss what he overheard Rick talk to her about. Michonne argues that the groups are looking out for each other, and that people are risking their lives for each other's safety. When the topic turns to their experiences in the post-apocalyptic world, Heath insists that he knows how dangerous it can get, but Michonne argues that her group had been through a lot worse, asking if Heath had "ever been covered in so much blood, that [he] didn't know if it was [his], or walkers, or [his] friend's." Heath is then left to think.

After Michonne kills two walkers hiding in the storage room, the group finds that the walkers outside had heard the commotion and that the larger herd is now heading in their direction. They burst out of the pet store, opening fire on the surrounding walkers before making a hasty evacuation. Annie and David are killed during the escape, with Heath witnessing both deaths, being unable to help in either situation.

Heath, Scott and Michonne are later seen traversing a small stream, where Heath looks down at his blood-soaked reflection in the water, remembering Michonne's words and realizing the reality of the situation at hand. They eventually make it back to Alexandria, passing burnt structures on their way to the gate.



"
No Way Out
"


Heath is seen holing up in the infirmary with 
Aaron
 and 
Spencer
 during the massive walker invasion in Alexandria. After spotting Rick (who is holding an unconscious 
Carl
) and Michonne frantically cutting a path to the infirmary, Denise, who had arrived moments earlier, calls for Heath, Aaron and Spencer to help her with preparing the operating table, with Heath ordered to acquire several IV bags.

Heath watches as Carl is set on a gurney and wheeled to the center of the room, and looks on in shock as Rick steps outside and makes a stand against the herd. He encourages Aaron and Spencer to join the fight and help Rick with clearing out the dead. The stand-off lasts for several minutes before they are joined by many of the residents. With the timely arrival of 
Daryl
, 
Sasha
 and 
Abraham
, the groups, including Heath, continue to kill walkers until the entire town is cleared out. Heath is seen the next morning resting in front of the infirmary, overlooking the corpse-filled streets.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"


Heath is first seen with many of the residents in the church, listening to Rick's proposed plan of attack against 
the Saviors
 for the benefit of the community.

The next day, he is seen with the main group as they make preparations for their encounter. As the group is split, Heath is paired with Glenn and they make their way into a forest in search of walkers. After finding and putting several down, Heath and Glenn converse, sharing their anxiety at the thought of killing living people, something neither had done in the past. Both confess that they are nervous and begin to show concern for the possible effects that committing these acts would have on them. After sawing off the heads of the walkers they had killed, the two men carry them back to the rest of the group. Heath listens to Rick as he voices his plans of attacking a few hours before dawn.

Hours before dawn, the group assembles after taking down two guards at the front entrance of the Saviors' compound. They head inside and begin to quietly dispatch slumbering members. Heath and Glenn head into one of the bedrooms and put down two Saviors - it is Glenn, however, who kills both, as Heath is still unable to bring himself to kill a living person. Once the alarms are triggered, Heath and Glenn make a hasty escape through the compound's halls, tailed by several Saviors. They manage to break into a small armory room and, with weapons acquired from the shelves, open fire on the chasing Saviors through the closed door, killing them. The two stare at the carnage in shock and are almost killed by a surviving Savior before 
Jesus
 saves them.

After several hours, everyone reconvenes outside. Glenn follows Heath as he enters one of the nearby vehicles, asking him to postpone his two-week supply run. Heath refuses, and he and 
Tara
 immediately make their way out of the compound to start their run.

"
Swear
"


Heath rests in the camper with Tara and they discuss their actions at the Savior outpost and whether the killings were done because they needed to in order to outlive them as a group or because it was the right thing. Tara tries to convince Heath that they had to dispatch the Saviors and brings up that they should keep scavenging, despite it being two weeks, due to the fact that they have not found much. As they drive, they come across a bridge barricaded with cargo containers. They exit the vehicle and climb on top of the containers and see an abandoned camp along with a bunch of parked cars and a pile of sand, having been dumped by two trucks. As they scavenge the camp, Tara finds a bag sticking out of the sand. As she tugs on it, the sand is displaced, revealing numerous zombies that were buried underneath. Heath and Tara fight for their lives as the zombies overwhelm them, with Heath making a stand on the back of a military Humvee, trying to rescue Tara from the zombies. Unfortunately for Heath, Tara falls over the bridge into the water, forcing him to retreat. When Tara eventually makes her way back to the bridge, she finds Heath gone together with the RV, leaving behind his broken glasses and a plastic card with "PPP" written on it. Heath is nowhere to be found on the bridge or Alexandria.

At some point after being separated from Tara, Heath was captured by the

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Delvin
.

Heath was described as "Early 20s. African-American. An intelligent, cynical and serious-minded guy with a "Jim from 'The Office'" level of disbelief and dislike for the stupidity he often encounters. The only thing he has that passes for humor is his occasional sarcasm. He's not angry or ill-tempered, he just thinks that people can be (and often are) very dumb. If pressed, he'd reluctantly admit that he thinks most people have the potential to be good."


Heath was credited in "
Start to Finish
" but did not appear in the episode.

He was also originally planned to appear in "
Now
" but the scenes were cut.


On 
Talking Dead
, it was confirmed that 
the RV
 
Anne
 was driving at the beginning of "
What Comes After
" was the same RV driven by Heath in his last appearance.

Angela Kang
 confirmed that Heath was captured by 
the Scavengers
 and was traded to the "
Helicopter Group
" for supplies.


It's possible that Heath was killed off by the CRM, as it was revealed in 
Season 2
 of 
The Walking Dead: World Beyond
 what happened to all of the captured survivors labeled as an "
A
" (used as test subjects at the 
Civic Republic Research Facility
).
[1]
 However, it's also possible that Heath was considered to be a "B" instead as he better fits the description of an ordinary person who is just trying to survive and was thus allowed to join the 
Civic Republic of Philadelphia
.


Heath appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
".
