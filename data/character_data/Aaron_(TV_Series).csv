,,"Aaron is described as ""an affable, good-natured, adventurous guy. Despite feeling like a bit of an outsider for most of his life, he's passionate about people and the good they can do. He doesn't think twice about putting himself in danger if he believes something positive can come from it."" Aaron had been mistreated and ostracized most of his life, mostly due to him being openly gay and the reaction of people's homophobia, including abuse from his own mother. Despite this, Aaron consistently saw the good in people even though they were acting offensive. He has a good judge of character. Aaron is very altruistic and always wanted to help others, leading him to join a NGO and give supplies to those residing in the Niger River Delta. Alongside his charitable personality, Aaron also has a sense of humor and optimism. He aims to keep people at ease with him. Sometimes his humor goes over people's heads, but he still aims for them to see the brighter side of things as he does. Aaron was supportive of Daryl's status as an outsider as well as comforting Maggie when Glenn disappeared. One of the things he enjoys doing is photography and collecting memorabilia from the places he had visited. After the apocalypse, he began collecting license plates from each state to create a mural on a wall in his house. Aaron extremely loves and cares for Eric , his husband. Both had been outsiders, treated with bigotry, and were the only people in the world who understood each other. Both worked together in recruiting outsiders for Alexandria as well as collecting license plates for their collection. Aaron is willing to tolerate many things, but one thing he can't tolerate is Eric being threatened or harmed in any way. He would even result to violence, something he is usually against, if it meant defending Eric, including putting himself in danger. After Aaron brought Rick Grimes ' group into Alexandria, he and Eric grew a close bond to one of the group members, Daryl Dixon . Aaron saw that, like himself and Eric, Daryl was an outsider to both his own group and Alexandria and that people fear him even though they do not know him. Because of Eric's near-death experience, Aaron had him retire and gave the position to Daryl so that Eric could stay safe and that Daryl could get out more and be himself. Aaron's affection gave Daryl purpose and was willing to sacrifice himself for Aaron's safety so that he could be safe if nothing else. During the seventh season , despite Eric being against Rick's plan to rebel against the Saviors, considering it to be too risky and there could be a lot of victims from this conflict, Aaron believes in Rick and his will for freedom and argues that in order to ensure their freedom they must fight, even if there will be victims, as the war will be the only way to build their future. After Eric dies during the war with Negan and the Saviors , Aaron becomes deeply depressed, as he was the only person Aaron had ever cared so much about. He becomes even more willing to do anything in order to put an end to the war forever. He and Enid then ask the community of Oceanside to aid them in finishing the war with the Saviors once and for all. The negotiations are hard, but Aaron finally convinces the Oceanside citizens to join the fight, which results in the victory for the Survivors against the war with the Saviors. After the war, Aaron starts training with Jesus to become a stronger fighter and takes a more proactive role in the community, including becoming a council member for Alexandria. When conflict with the Whisperers increases, Aaron becomes more cautious and less willing to take risks or let more people into the community. Despite any adversity, Aaron still clings to his humanity and tries to be the ""nice guy"", something he grows tired of as the Whisperer war continues.","Aaron was born and raised in Vermont. Aaron had a younger brother and spent their childhood together riding on bicycles around the neighborhood. His brother had a fascination with cars and, like Aaron, enjoyed being with other people. Growing up openly gay, Aaron's mother forced him to eat foods he didn't like; such as applesauce, salmon patties, and onions; to ""make [him] more manly"". Aaron viewed his mother as a ""very confused woman who tried her damnedest"". Aaron attended college and fell in love with a man during his education. The summer after he graduated, he and his boyfriend traveled to Eureka, California and hiked in the woods nearby. They found themselves in the middle of Native American ruins where Aaron reflected on what life was like for the Natives and their hopes for the future. Sometime later, Aaron and his boyfriend separated. Despite the abuse and bigotry he endured, Aaron still believed in doing the right thing. With his passion for people and the good they can do, Aaron began a career in politics to provide for and encourage others to make the world a better place. Aaron moved to Washington, D.C. and became a politician. After working in the political circuit, Aaron felt that he was not affecting change. He realized he could do his best work abroad in a hands-on approach that would utilize his skill set. Hoping to interact with people and provide for them, Aaron joined a humanitarian group and later became employed under a non-government organization tasked with giving supplies and food to people in the Niger River Delta. While working in the NGO, Aaron often encountered Nigerian warlords and violent militias while in his field and had to negotiate with them. Through working in the NGO, Aaron met Eric Raleigh in D.C. Upon their first meeting, Eric asked Aaron out that night and Aaron declined, but the two became friends and worked together. Eric knew how to handle the terrain due to being raised in the Appalachia's. Eric continued to ask Aaron out for the next six months until eventually Aaron said yes. On their fifth date, Aaron told Eric he loved him, to which Eric responded: ""I had a hunch."" After years together, Aaron and Eric considered themselves married despite gay marriage not being legal.","Aaron and Eric were living in Washington, D.C. when the Wildfire Virus went global in August 2010. During the fall , Aaron's younger brother died, affecting him greatly. Due to working in the political circuit, Aaron and Eric were among the first people evacuated from D.C. and brought to a suburban community in Alexandria, Virginia that was converted into a military safe zone for politicians in the area. Two weeks later, however, the military abandoned the safe zone due to Operation Cobalt . Among others evacuated to Alexandria were Ohio Congresswoman Deanna Monroe and her family. Aaron and Eric remained with the Monroe family as they saw promise with the safe zone. Eventually, walls were built around the area and a community was formed. The community had Deanna as its established leader. She believed that who people were before the fall mattered in rebuilding and sustaining the community. Because of Aaron and Eric's work in the NGO, their charitable nature, and ability to travel in dangerous terrain, it made them assets in the recruiting program designed to bring in more survivors. Aaron and Eric were tasked with finding survivors and monitoring them for several days to see if they were eligible for the community. Aaron would then approach the survivors with an offer, Eric being his guard, and bringing the survivors back to the safe zone to ""audition"" for citizenship. In their spare time, Aaron and Eric began a hobby of collecting license plates from abandoned cars from each state, making a mural of all fifty states in their home, in honor of his younger brother's love for cars. They also collected other vintage items to decorate in their home. In order to convince survivors to join the safe zone, Aaron took up photography and took pictures of the community as evidence. Back at the safe zone, despite rescuing a majority of the members there, the community still treated Aaron and Eric as outsiders because of their intolerance towards homosexuality, causing Aaron and Eric to avoid any gatherings and events of the community for fear of public ostracism in front of Deanna. At one point, Aaron and Eric recruited a man named Davidson , who was the leader of a small group, but they could not reside peacefully in the community. Deanna exiled them and had Aaron, a supply runner named Nicholas , and her son Aiden drive them out. The recruiting for larger groups was suspended, focusing on lone survivors. This occurred for several months until Deanna realized that in order for the community and its members to survive, they would need more people who have been out there longer to teach them how to handle the new world. Aaron started to look for larger groups with Eric. At one point, Aaron encountered two people who sought to kill him, forcing him to kill them. Aaron observed Rick Grimes and his group as they traveled to Washington, D.C. in hopes of finding other survivors. Aaron left bottles of water for them on their path as a test, but the group declined to drink from it, fearing it may be poisoned. When a storm emerges, group member Daryl Dixon informed the group of a barn he'd seen earlier and lead the group there to safety. This quick-thinking act to keep his people alive convinced Aaron that they needed to be brought back to Alexandria. The following morning, upon seeing that the group had survived the storm and the walker attack, Aaron had Eric remain nearby and watch in case anything happened to him as he approached the group.","This list shows the victims Aaron has killed: Buttons (Out of Mercy) Shelly Neudermeyer (Indirectly Caused) Richards (Indirectly Caused) Erin (Indirectly Caused) Stacy (Indirectly Caused) Michael (Indirectly Caused) Natalie Miller (Indirectly Caused) Bobby (Indirectly Caused) Dinesh (Indirectly Caused) Dan (Indirectly Caused) Samantha (Indirectly Caused) Holly (Indirectly Caused) O'Hara (Indirectly Caused) Charlyne (Indirectly Caused) Jeffery (Indirectly Caused) Park (Indirectly Caused) Adrian (Indirectly Caused) Young Boy (Zombified, alongside his fellow Alexandrians) Dino (Alongside his fellow Militia members) Mara (Caused, alongside his fellow Militia members) Natania (Indirectly Caused) Paul Rovia (Before Reanimation) Rifle Whisperer (Alongside Alden ) Troy (Zombified) Toby Carlson (Caused, Alive) McHugh (Alongside Daryl and Gabriel ) 2 unnamed people 2 unnamed Wolves (1 Alive and 1 Before Reanimation) 2 unnamed Alexandria residents (Zombified) 18 unnamed Saviors (6 Direct, 12 alongside Oceanside militia members) 1 unnamed Scavenger At least 9 unnamed Whisperers (5 Direct, 1 Alongside Kelly , 3 Alongside Alden ) At least 2 unnamed Coalition soldiers (Zombified) 4 unnamed Commonwealth soldiers (1 Direct, 3 Alongside Daryl and Gabriel) 1 boar Numerous counts of zombies","For a more in-depth look at Aaron's Relationships, read here: Aaron (TV Series)/Relationships",,"For more images of Aaron, please visit Aaron (TV Series)/Gallery .","The casting call for this character used the name Logan . Aaron was described as ""Early to Late 30s. An affable, good-natured, adventurous guy. Despite feeling like a bit of an outsider for most of his life (or perhaps because of it), he's passionate about people and the good they can do. He doesn't think twice about putting himself in danger if he believes something positive can come from it."" Robert Kirkman hinted on a Talking Dead special in November 2014 that the second half of Season 5 ""will contain a very prominent gay character from the comics "", likely referring to Aaron. Ross Marquand was later confirmed in January 2015 by TVLine to be playing the character. Aaron is the first openly male homosexual in the series , followed by Eric Raleigh , Paul Rovia , Livitz , and Zell . Aaron is the third openly homosexual character, preceded by Tara Chambler and Alisha , then followed by Eric Raleigh , Denise Cloyd , Paul Rovia , Magna , Yumiko Okumura , Kelly , Alpha , Livits , and Zell . As of Jesus ' death in "" Evolution "", Aaron is the only openly homosexual male main character still alive. And with Tara's death in "" The Calm Before "", he is now the longest-living LGBTQ+ character on the show. It was confirmed in "" Variant "" that Aaron and Eric were married - making them the first LGBT married couple in The Walking Dead franchise, followed by Felix Carlucci and Will Campbell in World Beyond , Tim and his husband in the Clementine series, Magna and Yumiko Okumura in the TV series, and Rèmy and Julien in Daryl Dixon . Ross Marquand had auditioned originally for the role of Gareth . Due to Ross Marquand's comedic acting and impressions, the casting director thought Ross would be better suited for Aaron because of the character's humor and had him return shortly after auditioning for Gareth to audition for Aaron. Gregory Peck's role as Atticus Finch in 1962's To Kill a Mockingbird was the basis of Ross Marquand's portrayal of Aaron. Ross elaborated that it was the character of Atticus Finch that got him interested in acting and had previously performed as him in a theater production. He also believed Aaron and Atticus had similar beliefs and traits of acceptance, altruism, and justice. Aaron is the first character involved in politics that was encountered in the TV Series , with the second being Deanna Monroe and the third being Pamela Milton . He was a politico in D.C., but he left before he had an official title. This was because he believed he could better use his altruistic personality in a hands-on approach in the peace corps rather than becoming a politician. Dante Esquivel from Fear the Walking Dead is also a politician, being the Municipal President of Tijuana. Qaletaqa Walker can also count as someone who is in politics as being the Chief of the Hopi Tribe. Ross Marquand revealed that Aaron is a fan of The Smiths , his favorite song specifically being ""Hand in Glove"", which in the lyrics alludes to lead singer Morrisey's sexuality and the homophobia that gay couples encounter when being public. Aaron was originally planned to appear in the episode "" Start to Finish "", but his scenes were cut. Given his surprise to when he catches Eric praying before battling the Saviors, it's possible Aaron is agnostic or atheist. In the script for "" The Day Will Come When You Won't Be "", there were three alternative death scenes, where two of them involved Aaron dying. One of them involved Maggie and Aaron dying, and another one where Aaron died first and Eugene dying afterwards. [2] Aaron is one of three characters known to use a substitute appendage on an amputate limb. The others being Merle Dixon and Hershel Greene . He is also the first character on The Walking Dead who use an iron arm prototype to substitute his own lost arm. Actor Tom Payne confirmed that Aaron and Jesus had a sexual encounter at least once during the six-year time-jump. Ross Marquand added that had Jesus survived, he and Aaron would eventually become romantically together. Aaron and Gabriel Stokes are the only characters introduced in Season 5 that are confirmed to be alive. Aaron is the first Alexandrian to appear in the series and the longest lasting survivor from Alexandria . Aaron is also the only remaining main character introduced in Alexandria. Aaron, Gabriel, and Barbara are the only named characters introduced in Season 5 to not die in the TV Series . Ross Marquand confirmed that at some point, Aaron did reveal to Gracie that she was adopted from the Saviors during the war, but he did not disclose to her that her father was directly killed by Rick in battle. Aaron is one of two known characters in The Walking Dead universe who hates salmon patties. The other being Charlie . A nightmare sequence involving Aaron in "" First Time Again "" was cut. Ross described it as Aaron and Eric in their living room, having a discussion about whether or not they should fight the Wolves . Suddenly, a Wolf comes up behind Eric and slits his throat. His blood shoots onto Aaron's face. [3] Regarding the anthology spin-off Tales of the Walking Dead , Ross Marquand mentioned he would like to see a backstory episode of Aaron in Nigeria while working for the NGO shortly before the outbreak. Tom Payne mentioned he would like to have an episode that featured the love story between Jesus and Aaron that took place during Season 8 and Season 9 time-jumps. Ross Marquand confirmed that the sword that Aaron currently wields had once belonged to Paul Rovia . [4] He stated: ""(...) it's sort of a ceremonial sword for him. Angela [Kang] and I both discussed it, and I said I don't think that he would just retire that sword. I think he would use that sword especially in very, very important battles, not only as a way of honoring Jesus, and everything that he taught Aaron, but also because it's a way of connecting the past the future. I think he held a great deal of reverence and friendship for Jesus, and that sword is a wonderful way of him continuing that tradition."" Aaron did a similar symbolic gesture when Eric died, and carried his gun from "" Monsters "" until the Saviors were defeated in "" Wrath "". Aaron stopped using the sword after attaching a mace to the end of his prosthetic arm , but he resumed using the weapon after trading the mace back in for a wooden hand attachment. This is best seen in "" Rest in Peace "" where Aaron uses the sword while fighting walkers in the Commonwealth. Aaron's appearance from Season 9 onwards bears a striking resemblance to Rick Grimes ' appearance from Issue 127 onwards. Both characters have a short buzzcut, long beards and a prosthetic arm. Aaron tells Lydia that she will occasionally suffer from phantom limb syndrome in "" Rest in Peace "", implying that he still does. Aaron's original ending in "" Rest in Peace "" involved Lydia giving Aaron a letter from a male admirer in the Commonwealth. Aaron declines, explaining that he is too busy - similar to how Aaron initially rejected Eric's advances for the same reasons. Gracie takes her father to the side and encourages him to pursue the relationship, arguing that he is always selfless and for once should do something for himself. Aaron is one of twelve characters to survive the TV Series who also survive in the Comic Series , the others being Maggie Rhee , Michonne Grimes , Eugene Porter , Hershel Rhee , Negan Smith , Magna , Yumiko Okumura , Lydia , Juanita Sanchez , Michael Mercer , and Pamela Milton . Aaron is the fifth main character to receive an amputation, with the first being Hershel Greene , the second being Merle Dixon , the third being Bob Stookey , the fourth being Tyreese Williams , and the sixth being Lydia .",
