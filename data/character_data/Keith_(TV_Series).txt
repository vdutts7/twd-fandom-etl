Thank 
you
--for this and for what you said. We weren't all like 
her
. Some of us just wanted to survive. (...) 
You
 don't think we've changed, do you? (...) I can 
prove
 it. (...) We saw one of your people--the 
girl
 who came out of the cave where Alpha kept the horde. (...) After the collapse, there were 
many
, then there were 
t
wo
, and then she was all alone. (...) She looked hurt, but alive. (...) In the woods. By the screaming cave.

Overview
[
]


Although part of the 
Whisperers
, Keith is not shown to be antagonistic. He has stated he was not a loyal follower to 
Alpha
, and that he only was in the group to survive. He also stated that he would give 
Lydia
 food whenever Alpha wasn’t watching, during the cold winters, although Lydia didn’t remember him being the one who did so. After the end of the Whisperer War, Keith became the leader of the remaining Whisperers. Despite this, he is shown to be quite timid and apprehensive. However, he is shown to be willing to sacrifice himself for his people, stabbing 
Aaron
 to buy the Whisperers time to escape. The group comes to conclusion that he and his people are not a threat. Even after being tortured, Keith is shown to be understanding. Ultimately, the group leaves Keith and the Whisperers alone.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Keith's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At some point following the outbreak, Keith joined a large group of survivors known as the 
Whisperers
. Keith used to secretly give 
Lydia
 extra food during the harsh winters when 
Alpha
 was not looking, although Lydia does not remember this.

Around the conclusion of the 
Whisperer War
, Keith and a few others had enough of Alpha's reign of terror and decided to defect from the Whisperers. The group of five former Whisperers became squatters at the ruins of Hilltop, turning the cellar into their home as they scavenged through the ruins for clothes, food, and other supplies



Season 11
[
]


"
Out of the Ashes
"
[
]


When Jerry, Aaron, Carol, and Lydia are clearing the Hilltop of the undead, they notice what appears to be a group of walkers corralled by a Whisperer. An enraged Aaron puts down the walkers and apprehends Keith, demanding to know if there are more Whisperers. The terrified man lies to the Alexandrians that he was by himself, before being forced to show the others the cellar where he was residing. In the cellar, Keith's fellow survivors are discovered and they escape as Keith attempts to take down Aaron. Furious, Aaron ties up Keith and proceeds to torture him for information, going as far as letting a walker bite his hand. Ultimately, Aaron is calmed down and the Alexandrians decide to let Keith and the former Whisperers stay in the Hilltop ruins, deciding they are not a threat and simply people who got mixed up with the Whisperers. The newly-amputated Keith is given a bag of food by Carol just as his fellow survivors return to Hilltop to his aid and to continue living out their days.



"
The Lucky Ones
"
[
]


Several months later, 
Maggie Rhee
 and several others reclaim the Hilltop Colony, with Keith and the other remaining Whisperers not seen or mentioned, leaving his location and status unknown.
