Trivia






Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Alex's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Alex joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
, where he was assigned as a nurse.



Season 9
[
]


"
Who Are You Now?
"
[
]


Although unseen, Alex assists an injured 
Yumiko
 brought to the infirmary since he and the other nurses are on standby. Once Yumiko is situated at the infirmary, Alex watches over her recovery.



"
Scars
"
[
]


Alex is at the infirmary and treats 
Henry
's leg injury after he arrives at Alexandria along with 
Daryl
, 
Lydia
, and 
Connie
.



Season 10
[
]


Following 
Enid
's 
death
, Alex moved to 
Hilltop
 to serve as the medic for the community.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"
[
]


One night, after a tree mysteriously falls onto a house and a portion of the Hilltop's walls, a number of residents are injured. Alex is summoned and he directs the injured to the infirmary as others help set up hospital beds in the trailers to accommodate the other injured.



"
Morning Star
"
[
]


Although unseen, Alex works in the infirmary tending to several Alexandrians, including 
Rosita
, 
Judith
, 
Gracie
, and 
R.J.
, who came to Hilltop for medical evaluations after Alexandria was attacked by the Whisperers.



"
Walk With Us
"
[
]


The Hilltop Colony was attacked by the Whisperers with their weaponized horde and flaming arrows, the latter of which caused the fire that quickly engulfed the settlement. Ultimately, it can be assumed that Alex was killed by the Whisperers or the zombies that continued to push into the burning Hilltop, as he was not seen among the several survivor groups to escape Hilltop, and was never seen at any point afterwards again.



"
Look at the Flowers
"
[
]


As an injured Rosita is being cared for by Eugene at the rendezvous point, Eugene comments that he will have Alex take a look at her, that is as soon as he is found, as Alex has not been among the survivors to reach the rendezvous point, which likely supports the fact that he did not survive. 



Death
[
]


Killed By


The Whisperers


Zombies


It can be assumed that Alex was killed by the Whisperers or the zombies that continued to push into the burning Hilltop, as he was not seen among the several survivor groups to escape Hilltop after the battle. It's unknown if he turned or not.
