Rick
's leadership and complains to 
Michonne
. He states that Rick brought them all out to die and that everyone is as good as dead. He also protests that Rick killed 
Carter
 despite the fact that Carter dying from a walker bite and Rick put him down out of mercy. Immediately after his protests, Barnes proves to be quite foolish, walking away from the rest of the group only to be bitten by a walker.

Rick

Michonne
