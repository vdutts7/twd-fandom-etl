Overview
[
]


Deaver is a brutish and aggressive individual as well as seemingly being one of the most physically capable 
Reapers
. When the group first encounter the Reapers after making it out of the 
subway tunnel
, Deaver is shown to be the one leading the pack into battle. When Deaver spots 
Maggie
 hot-wiring a truck, he immediately charges in and tries to stop her. However, he fails, allowing Maggie to ram the car into the 
Meridian
 gate and let the walker herd in. Later, Deaver encounters Maggie again and the two fight. Deaver is shown to be one of the strongest Reapers in terms of pure strength. Though Maggie tries to fight back, Deaver dodges and blocks her attacks. He manages to knock her to the floor with a single hit. He most definitely would've killed Maggie if not for 
Gabriel
 who shoots Deaver in the head with a sniper.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Afghanistan
[
]


Prior to the outbreak, Deaver was fighting in Afghanistan along with the rest of his squad which included a lot of members that would eventually become 
Reapers
. Upon returning from war, he struggled to find jobs or deal with trauma, but the relationship between him and his comrades remained strong. He then decided to become a mercenary.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the beginning of the outbreak, as 
Operation Cobalt
 was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the 
undead
 threat, 
Pope
 and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as "the chosen ones". It is unknown if Deaver was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers, and either found or crafted his own mask with a heavily scarred and gnarled expression on it, and would use this mask as a scare tactic against those who were "marked" by Pope.



Tennessee
[
]


At some point, Deaver and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by 
Maggie Rhee
 despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group.



Season 11
[
]


"
Acheron: Part II
"
[
]


Deaver and at least a dozen Reapers appear on a dark road adorned on both sides with bodies hanging from posts, with Deaver at the head of the group. Suddenly, the Reapers open fire on Maggie and her group, killing Roy and severely injuring Cole. As the Alexandrians flee into the woods, the Reapers chase after them.



"
Hunted
"
[
]


Chaos breaks out in the woods as Deaver and the Reapers hunt down members of Maggie's group, killing Cole and injuring several others, including Duncan, Negan, Daryl, and Gabriel.



"
Rendition
"
[
]


While 
Daryl
 is being taken in for interrogation by 
Carver
 and 
Powell
, Deaver can be seen amongst his comrades within 
Meridian
. Deaver is seated around the campfire eating dinner with his fellow Reapers including the newly recruited 
Daryl Dixon
. He is shocked and disturbed when Pope horrifically kills 
Bossie
 by throwing him in the fire.



"
For Blood
"
[
]


While getting some chains to secure 
Meridian
's gate, Deaver spots Maggie hot-wiring a truck. He attempts to stop her but fails, allowing Maggie to crash into the gate allowing walkers to enter. He later attacks and disarms her. Right before Deaver can finish Maggie off, Gabriel shoots him in the head with a rifle.
