, 
Siddiq
, and 
Magna's group
 approach the Hilltop, Roy and another 
messenger
 arrive on horseback to meet with the caravan. Michonne questions their spears and if they are from Hilltop. Roy replies that they are and reports that

"
Walk With Us
"
[

The Hilltop Colony was attacked by the

"
Acheron: Part I
"
[
]


Roy is part of a group consisting of Daryl, Elijah, Maggie, Carol, Alden, Rosita, Lydia, Jerry, Gage, Kelly, and Magna who raid the abandoned 
Fort Connors
 military base for food supplies. He remains on watch on the roof as the women make their way into a hangar by rope to collect supplies. When walkers attack the women, Roy joins the others as an archer to protect the women. After the mission, Roy returns to Alexandria with his fellow survivors.

Roy joins the mission to salvage food and water from Meridian to feed the large population in Alexandria. Part of a group consisting of Maggie, Daryl, Alden, Cole, Elijah, Gage, Negan, Frost, Duncan, Agatha, and Gabriel, the survivors utilize Negan's familiarity with the DC area to travel to Meridian. Due to the 
heavy rainstorm
, the survivors are forced to head into the subway tunnels to complete the journey. While in the tunnels, they come across hundreds of body bags, many containing walkers in them. At some point while dispatching the body bag walkers, Roy and 
Gage
 go missing, along with the group's ammo and supplies. Shortly after this realization, a large group of walkers appear, forcing the other survivors to move forward in the tunnel without being able to search for Roy or Gage.



"

Roy is spotted by 
Daryl
 in the tunnel stumbling away from walkers before collapsing. After Daryl kills the walkers, he approaches Roy. Roy explains he went outside in 
the storm
 and got hit with debris. He then states he lost 
Gage
 and the ammo bag before handing Daryl a grenade and a handgun. He requests Daryl to tell his children he did not die a coward. Eventually, Roy is patched up. Later, when the survivors head outside and witness hanging bodies, the group is ambushed by 
Reapers
 and Roy is shot in the head with an arrow, killing him.

Trivia
[
]


This character is credited as 
Hilltop Rider
 in "
Stradivarius
".

In Season 11, this character was given the name 
Roy
.


C. Thomas Howell is the real life friend of 
Michael Cudlitz
 and was given this role due to his ability to ride a horse at high speed and deliver lines all at once, without needing a stuntman to perform the stunts. One of the conditions C. Thomas Howell proposed that his character have the opportunity to be recurring.

C. Thomas Howell was brought back two seasons later for four episode appearances and his character's death.


This character was portrayed by photo double and stand-in actor William Michael deArmon in "
Evolution
" as C. Thomas Howell was not available for filming.

Criminal Minds
 and later on
