Nothing is known about Betsy's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[

Virginia
[

Now
"
[

Having survived the attack by the 
the Wolves
, Betsy is among the surviving townspeople to gather by the front gate and damaged wall panel. She is in a complete state of shock and stares at the wall, completely despondent over her recently deceased husband, David. As she and the others listen to 
Rick
 and Aaron addressing the crowd regarding the attack, she is briefly comforted by fellow widow 
Jessie Anderson
. A short time after the speech, Betsy and two other 
women
 create a memorial on one of the wall panels and paint the names of those lost during the attack and the compromised redirection of the walkers from the rock quarry.

Later that day, Betsy commits suicide over the loss of her husband and having no will or reason to live. When Jessie walks by Betsy's house, she realizes something is off about her home and approaches the front door. At the window, she discovers a reanimated and bloodied Betsy and proceeds to put her down as other residents watch in horror.

Trivia
[
]


Betsy is incorrectly credited as 
Betsey
 while 
Talking Dead
 and David's note in "
Thank You
" spells her name as Betsy. The name of her counterpart in the Comic Series is also spelled as Betsy.


Betsy, along with 
Tommy
, are absent from the memorial wall, despite being Alexandrians who recently died.


Betsy is the only named character to be killed by 
Jessie Anderson
, albeit zombified.
