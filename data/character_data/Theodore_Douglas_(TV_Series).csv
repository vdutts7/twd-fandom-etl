T-Dog was originally going to live in the episode ""Killer Within"", and Carol was scripted to die. Later, it was changed to T-Dog dying and Carol living.

On 
Talking Dead
, 
Gregory Nicotero
 revealed that part of T-Dog's death scene was filmed with a realistic replica that was actually cast from IronE Singleton's face/head and shoulders. The replica has a large portion of the front of its neck ripped out.


Before the role went to Singleton, 
Markice Moore
, the actor who portrayed
