Overview
[
]


O'Donnell is an abusive, cruel, and condescending bully. He is among the most vicious cops at the 
Hospital
, beating 
Percy
, an old man, after he doesn't stitch a hole properly. It's also mentioned by 
Dawn
 that he and his buddies laughed at 
Joan
 when she got raped. Eventually Dawn has enough of his behavior and confronts him, causing a fight between the two. With the help of 
Beth
, she and Dawn manage to subdue O'Donnell by shoving him down an elevator shaft.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


O'Donnell served as an officer in the 
Atlanta Police Department
, and was a close friend and fellow academy rookie to 
Dawn Lerner
. He was married to a wife, and together they had a child who was born in Grady Memorial. During the outbreak he was one of the officers tasked with evacuating the very same hospital, and then staying behind to help sweep the building for remaining civilians. He and his team then witnessed 
the bombing
 of 
Atlanta
, and he survived up until the show's events, though not without losing much of his humanity. The fate of his family is unknown but dialogue suggests they were killed during the outbreak as he never mentioned any hope of reuniting with them, which could have been a contributing factor to the loss of his humanity.

O'Donnell berates 
Percy
 for not properly stitching a hole in his sleeve and shoves him to the ground. Beth looks on. He starts trying to draft her into service, but Dawn calls her away. Beth then walks in on them, catching them in the conversation. O'Donnell says it's time to make a change, that either Dawn can admit the situation to the rest of the officers or he will. Dawn pulls her gun on him and the two argue. He comes after her, knocking her gun down the elevator shaft and the two fight. He starts to get the better of her and Beth steps in to help. When he's distracted by Beth, Dawn is able to seize the opportunity to regain the advantage and punches him in the throat and kicks him backwards towards the elevator. At Dawn's shout, Beth shoves O'Donnell down the elevator shaft, falling to his death. His body may have been eaten by the walkers at the bottom of the shaft.
