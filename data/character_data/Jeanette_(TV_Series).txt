Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing¬†is known about Jeanette's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Season 3
[
]


While Jeanette was never seen in Season 3, she was living in Woodbury and was among the elderly, women, and children to be brought to join the community at the 
West Georgia Correctional Facility
.



Season 4
[
]


"
Infected
"
[
]


Jeanette was in Cell Block D when it was attacked by the infected prison residents. As a zombified 
Mr. Richards
 wanders out of his cell, Jeanette flees the chaos with 
Mrs. Richards
 and a 
young man
 and is able to get to safety.



"
Isolation
"
[
]


Jeanette is a part of a group of residents, consisting of 
Owen's mother
, 
Noris' son
, an 
elderly Woodbury man
, and an 
older woman
, brought to Cell Block A to be quarantined. Prior to entering the cell block, she pleads with 
Carol
 to not place her in Cell Block A, stating that she doesn't have the flu and is suffering from allergies instead. However Carol does not believe Jeanette and orders her back into the cell block.



"
Internment
"
[
]


As the sick survivors rest in their cells, Jeanette passes the time playing checkers with 
Luke
 in a cell. When a man succumbs to the flu and drops dead outside his cell, Jeanette steps out of her cell to witness the commotion and Hershel and Sasha's reactions. When the pair wheel the dead man's body away, Jeanette returns into her cell. During the commotion as many more patients die and turn, Jeanette remains sheltered in her cell.



"
Too Far Gone
"
[
]


When the prison is attacked by the Governor and his group, Jeanette flees the burning prison and quickly boards the bus along with many other fleeing residents. When 
Maggie
 gets onto the bus and asks Jeanette where her sister 
Beth
 is, Jeanette states that Beth left in search of 
Rick
's infant daughter 
Judith
. Maggie gets off the bus and runs while Jeanette watches in fear. Later, the bus drives off with Jeanette and the other evacuees.



"
Inmates
"
[
]


When Maggie, 
Bob
, and Sasha encounter the bus on the road, they find everyone inside had died or turned, forcing them to put down their former friends. While Jeanette is not seen as a zombie, it has been confirmed that all of the prison bus survivors were killed. There are several bloody corpses inside the bus as Maggie looks for her husband 
Glenn
, suggesting that Jeanette was likely devoured.

(Caused)


Zombies


Jeanette is among the prison residents who escape on the bus during the Governor's attack. However, when Maggie, Bob, and Sasha find the bus, it is revealed that everyone on board had died, either from being shot in the assault or attacked by those who died from the flu and turned on the bus. 

It is possible Jeanette was devoured as she was not one of the reanimated residents to stumble off the bus.

Sherry Richards did not film for "Inmates" and the actress wasn't asked to film after production realized they had too many people on the bus, so she was omitted from filming, alongside several prison extras including 
Denny Ainsworth and Hannah Moore
, despite all of them being seen fleeing on the bus. However, Jeanette's demise was represented by the several bloodied corpses on the bus.
