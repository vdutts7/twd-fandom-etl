Overview
[
]


Winnie initially comes off as a sweet and kind-hearted girl. However in actuality, Winnie, like the rest of her group, is a brutal, ruthless, and hardened survivor who was brainwashed by 
Jocelyn
 to become a remorseless killer. She shoots 
Daryl
 in the chest and painfully burns 
Michonne
. She is shown to be completely loyal to Jocelyn and follows her orders without question. After Jocelyn's death, Winnie is shown to be shocked. She is then ordered by 
Mitchell
 to kill all of the children. However, Winnie seems to be quite hesitant about this and stops to look at Michonne when she calls out her name. After the death of the rest of her group, Winnie ultimately doesn't follow through with killing the children and cries at the sight of her dead friends. She runs away and is never seen again.

In a flashback, Winnie, 
Jocelyn
, and 
Mitchell
 are found by a group from Alexandria in the woods and are brought to the community. 
Michonne
 recognizes Jocelyn as her friend from college and decides to let her group stay.

A while later, Jocelyn runs from the infirmary panicking and tells Michonne she needs to get back to "them". Michonne calms her down and offers help. Later, Michonne and a group follow Winnie to a factory where they find several kids hiding out and bring them to Alexandria.

At night, Winnie and the rest of Jocelyn's kid group enjoys a bonfire with the community kids. In the middle of the night, Jocelyn and her group kidnap 
Judith
 and other children, kill a resident, and leave with the food supply and guns.

The next day, Michonne and 
Daryl
 spot 
P.J.
 outside of an 
abandoned school
. They chase him until they're met by all of the kids in a hallway. Daryl gets shot in the shoulder with an arrow while 
Linus
 knocks Michonne unconscious.

Sometime later, they wake up bloodied and tied to a pipe. Linus painfully brands an iron X on Daryl and Jocelyn tells Michonne the kids can't be soft. Winnie then brands Michonne as she shrieks in pain. However, Michonne and Daryl manage to get free.

Michonne finds an exit and is immediately beaten over and over with a wooden plank by Jocelyn. Michonne summons the strength to stab her in her leg and the chest, killing her. Michonne gets up and tells the kids they can all return to Alexandria, but Mitchell instructs the kids to kill the Alexandrians as he deals with her. She's forced to kill him as the other kids close in. Michonne begs the kids to stop but they all attack her and she's forced to kill them one by one until Winnie remains. She cries at the sight of her dead friends and then runs away.

Her ultimate location and fate remain unknown.
