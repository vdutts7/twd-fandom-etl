Overview


Beatrice is a feisty and courageous survivor. She can be ruthless when necessary, but it's usually out of the good of her 
community
. After the 
Saviors
 killed all the men, she along with the rest of the community had become untrusting of outsiders and are ordered to kill on sight. After 
Tara
 is spotted in the community, she along with the others attempt to kill her. When Tara subdues her and takes her gun, believing Tara will kill her, Beatrice is shown to not be afraid for her life and even beckons Tara to kill her. However, Tara instead knocks Beatrice out. Beatrice takes note of Tara sparing her life, which is the main reason the Oceansiders don't immediately kill Tara. However, she and 
Kathy
 are later ordered to kill Tara by 
Natania
. Tara manages to escape but Beatrice later catches her and holds her at gunpoint. She is shown to be remorseful for having to kill Tara, but almost goes through with it believing it'll keep the community safe. However, 
Cyndie
 saves Tara by tackling Beatrice at the last moment.

Beatrice is shown to have a particular hatred for the Saviors due to them killing her husband. Beatrice greatly fears them along with the rest of her community. While holding Tara at gunpoint, Beatrice tells her that they shouldn't have attacked the 
Satellite Outpost
 and now it's too late for her friends. Her main reason for almost shooting Tara is so that she doesn't lead the Saviors to Oceanside. However, later when 
Rick
's group surrounds the Oceanside residents for their weapons, Beatrice seems interested in joining the fight against the Saviors. Though later she and the other Oceansiders are forbidden to do so by Natania. However, after Natania's death, Cyndie is forced to take over. Though Cyndie is also firm on not joining the fight, she later caves in and she, along with Beatrice and the Oceansiders join the fight, throwing Molotov Cocktails at the Saviors to stop them from entering 
Hilltop
.

After the war is over, peace is made throughout the communities. However, this also includes working together with the Saviors, much to Beatrice and the other Oceansider's disdain. But after they see 
Maggie
 kill 
Gregory
 after he tried to kill her, the Oceansiders become inspired to also take revenge on the Saviors who wronged them. Beatrice captures 
Justin
, the man who had killed her husband, and executes him, finally getting her revenge. After Maggie and 
Daryl
 find out it was the Oceansiders who killed the Saviors, Beatrice shows no remorse for what she did, seeing it as justice. During the 
Whisperer War
, Beatrice shows her bravery by volunteering to take audio equipment through a herd. However, a Whisperer stabs Beatrice in the leg, incapacitating her. In her last moments, Beatrice attempts to give 
Carol
 the equipment, knowing that she is done for. Though Carol doesn't do it, Lydia manages to grab the equipment shortly after her demise.



Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Beatrice's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had a husband.



Post-Apocalypse


Virginia


Beatrice and her husband survived the early stages of the outbreak and eventually they found themselves as members of a large group of survivors led by a woman named 
Natania
. Unfortunately, her group would be discovered by a large, hostile 
organization of survivors
 led by 
Simon
 (who later became 
Negan Smith
's ruthless and sadistic second-in-command) and under his orders, Beatrice and her people were forced to gather and provide supplies for them under threat of death. Eventually, under Natania's orders, the group initiated a rebellion to fight back against their oppressors. However, due to being outgunned and outnumbered, their group was defeated. As punishment for their defiance and to deter any further resistance, Simon had his group murder every male survivor above the age of 10 in Beatrice's group, with Beatrice's husband being executed by a man named 
Justin
.

Following this and being unwilling to continue working for Simon and his group, Beatrice and her group, consisting mainly of females now, fled their community and established a new home at a location called 
Oceanside
 and reestablished their community hidden from them. In order to prevent Simon and his group from finding them again, Natania ordered any survivor who happened upon the community to be immediately killed in order to maintain the secrecy of their new home.

Swear

When a stranger named 
Tara Chambler
 stumbles upon Oceanside, Beatrice attempts to capture her but Tara gets the upper-hand and chooses to knock out Beatrice with her gun instead of killing her. Because of this, Tara is allowed to live and is then held in a cabin for questioning. Later that day, Beatrice questions her with 
Natania
 and 
Kathy
. That night, the women have supper and attempt to persuade Tara to stay with them in Oceanside. However, Tara wants to go back home to her 
girlfriend
 and the women offer to escort Tara back to the bridge where she last saw her companion 
Heath
. 

After Tara reveals that her group killed a group of bandits at a 
satellite station
, Beatrice and Kathy are ordered by Natania to secretly kill her. The next morning, Tara discovers their real plan and tries to flee but Beatrice finds her. While holding her at gunpoint, she reveals the Saviors had attacked them before until she is knocked out by 
Cyndie
. A short time later, Beatrice and Kathy arrive at the bridge and bring Cyndie back home after Tara successfully escapes.

 to Oceanside to gather guns from the community's armory. When bombs begin to go off in the outskirts of Oceanside, Beatrice and Kathy attempt to run towards the armory but they are stopped by 
Daryl
 and 
Jesus
, who tells them to put their hands behind the head. She reluctantly obeys and is brought to the woods with the other Oceanside residents.

When Natania and Cyndie talk about fighting the Saviors, Beatrice seems somewhat interested in joining the battle. Shortly after, she is among the survivors to help defend the Oceanside residents from walkers and then shakes hands with

Trivia


Beatrice is the first 
Oceanside
 resident who was killed by the 
Whisperers
.


Briana Venskus was available for filming for all of Season 10 but since Sydney Park wasn't as available, Oceanside was not written into the season as much, reducing opportunities for Beatrice to make an appearance.


In an interview, the actress confirmed she wanted Beatrice to be gay and was "waiting for her to come out of the closet" and hit on Tara in Season 7.

The actress also talked about the casting process for Beatrice. She was given a "dummy script" where she portrayed a police officer who was trying to take down a violent gang and took one of the members captive to persuade them to leave the gang, which referred to a scene in "
Swear
" where Beatrice captured Tara and told her the Saviors aren't all dead and are more powerful than they think.


Beatrice appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.
