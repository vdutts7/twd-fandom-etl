Overview
[
]


Kent, like many others in 
Alexandria
, started as a weak survivor due to living safely inside the walls. When times get tough after 
the Wolves
, he gets desperate and raids the food pantry with many others. However, he eventually learns to become a true survivor and when a huge herd of walkers get into Alexandria, he is among those to go out and help clear the herd. From there, he goes onto be a brave man, helping to fight back against 
the Saviors
 until his demise.

At some point in the apocalypse, Kent joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
.

Conquer
"

Kent is among the townspeople present at the community forum to discuss Rick's fate. He is seated next to Barbara and listens to his fellow residents as they speak.

Reg Monroe

Pete Anderson
.



Season 6
[
]


"
Now
"
[
]


Having survived the assault made on the community by 
the Wolves
, Kent is one of the many townspeople by the front gate, listening to the growing horde gathering outside the walls. He appears to be very concerned about the situation and listens to Rick and 
Aaron
 as they address the crowd. Afterwards, Kent along with several other residents attempt to raid the food of the pantry despite 
Olivia
's pleas until they are eventually calmed down by 
Spencer
.



"
Heads Up
"
[
]


Kent is among the Alexandrians that assists at 
Rosita
's machete lesson to learn how to defend themselves against walkers. He listens uncomfortably as Rosita talks to Eugene about death and how much harder it is to witness others dying around you versus dying yourself. Later that day, Kent attends 
Gabriel
's prayer circle with 
Bob
, Barbara, 
Kyle
, and several other Alexandrians when they witness 
Enid
 and 
Glenn
's green balloons floating in the sky, just before the wall is brought down by the collapsing church steeple, allowing the herd to invade Alexandria.



"
No Way Out
"
[
]


Kent takes shelter inside one of the houses when the herd invades the community. That night, he witnesses Rick and other residents slaughtering walkers in the streets and is inspired to join the group where they battle the entire herd for hours until dawn when all the walkers are finally killed.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"
[
]


Kent is present at the meeting in the church, listening to Rick's speech about the danger of

[
]


"
Service
"
[
]


Kent stands outside with 
Tobin
 and

"
Sing Me a Song
"
[
]


Kent walks by the Grimes' house, where he is greeted by 
Negan
, who is holding 
Judith
 and talking to 
Carl
.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"
[
]


Kent is among the Alexandrians armed and ready to battle the Saviors alongside the 
Scavengers
. He is stationed in the front of a house with several Alexandrians and Scavengers when suddenly, the Scavenger leader 
Jadis

Trivia
[
]


Kent was credited in "
Start to Finish
" but did not appear in the episode.


While David filmed for "
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
", the majority of his scenes were cut, except for the quick shot of him before the Scavengers' betrayal, which is why the producers did not credit him for the episode.

Deleted scenes from the finale include several Alexandrians being gunned down in battle against the Saviors and Scavengers as well as being executed after they were captured. Kent was not seen in any post-battle scene, including the burial and speech scenes. Additionally, since the Season 7 finale, David Marshall Silverman has not filmed and Kent has not been mentioned in any further episodes, indicating he was likely one of the Alexandrians killed off-screen in the episode.
