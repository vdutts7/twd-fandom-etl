Overview
[
]


Nabila is a kind and sweet woman. Though initially just a gardener, she eventually goes on to become a soldier for the 
Militia
. She is a loving wife to her husband 
Jerry
 and caring mother to her children, usually seen taking care of them.

Nabila is shown to be extremely brave and willing to risk her life for what she believes in. Examples of this are her joining the Militia and Ezekiel's rebellion against the sadistic 
Warden
 in 
Alexandria
, bravely standing in front of a firing squad to protect 
Negan
 and 
Annie
.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Nabila's life prior to or as the outbreak began. She was likely a follower of Islam before the start of the apocalypse, as it's unlikely she became devout after it commenced.

At some point in the apocalypse, Nabila joined a community called 
the Kingdom
 where she became a gardener.

Bury Me Here

Nabila approaches 
Ezekiel
 as he observes the Kingdom from a second-story balcony but is cautious due to 
Shiva
 lounging nearby. Despite being reassured by Ezekiel that Shiva likes her, Nabila still chooses to remain a distance away. Nabila then informs Ezekiel that the Kingdom’s gardens are infested with weevils and the crops in the garden are therefore ruined. She suggests they replant the crops in the garden while acknowledging how important the gardens were to Ezekiel. Later that day, she and other gardeners start removing the plants as Ezekiel watches on.

How It's Gotta Be

 is saying his speech to the Kingdommers, Nabila looks around knowing Ezekiel will be there. When Ezekiel rams the school bus, Nabila subdues a Savior and takes his gun.

Nabila then flees the Kingdom with the rest of the group to the safe house.

 and the other Kingdommers off to the cottage.

When a group of walkers suddenly ambushed the lumber yard, Nabila is among those to arrive in time to save

Later that day, Nabila welcomes the first half of the Hilltop delegation and their escorts to the Kingdom. She chats with

 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds.

At the fair, Nabila is asked by

Frankie
 recently, to which Nabila shrugs and looks around. That night, Nabila and her family alongside Judith attend the theater and watch the movie.
