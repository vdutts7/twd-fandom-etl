Overview
[
]

Oceanside
. She also seems to be one of the most combat proficient. She and 
Beatrice
 are ordered by 
Natania
 to secretly execute 
Tara
, though she manages to escape. Later, when 
Rick
's group takes 
Oceanside
's weapons, Kathy is among those who seem interested in joining fight against the 
Saviors
 to get revenge on those who wronged them. Though later she seems to lose interest after 
Enid
 kills Natania. Kathy even suggests to kill Enid and 
Aaron
 for what they did. However, later Kathy and the other Oceanside residents join the fight and save 
Hilltop
. After peace is made among the communities, Kathy is inspired with her fellow Oceansiders to kill the Saviors who murdered all the men in their community. Though this gets her killed when the Saviors attack the camp to get revenge on them.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Kathy's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


Kathy survived the early stages of the outbreak and eventually found herself as a member of a large group of survivors led by a woman named 
Natania
. Unfortunately, her group would be discovered by a large, hostile 
organization of survivors
 led by 
Simon
 (who later became 
Negan
's ruthless and sadistic second-in-command) and under his orders, Kathy and her people were forced to gather and provide supplies for them under threat of death. Eventually, under Natania's orders, the group initiated a rebellion to fight back against their oppressors. However, due to being outgunned and outnumbered, their group was defeated. As punishment for their defiance and to deter any further resistance, Simon had his group murder every male survivor above the age of 10 in Kathy's group. It is unknown if any of Kathy's family were among the casualties of the rebellion or subsequent massacre.

Following this and being unwilling to continue working for Simon and his group, Kathy and her group, consisting mainly of females now, fled their community and established a new home at a location called 
Oceanside
 and reestablished their community hidden from them. In order to prevent Simon and his group from finding them again, Natania ordered any survivor who happened upon the community to be immediately killed in order to maintain the secrecy of their new home.

When a stranger named 
Tara
 is captured after stumbling upon Oceanside, Kathy watches as 
Beatrice
 and 
Natania
 question her. That night, the women have supper and attempt to persuade Tara to stay with them in Oceanside. However, Tara wants to go back home to her 
girlfriend
 and the women offer to escort Tara back to the bridge where she last saw her companion 
Heath
.

After Tara reveals that her group killed a group of bandits at a 
Satellite station
, Kathy and Beatrice are ordered by Natania to kill secretly her. The next morning, Tara discovers their real plan and manages to flee from them. A short time later, Kathy and Beatrice arrive at the bridge and bring 
Cyndie
 back home after Tara successfully escapes.



"
Something They Need
"


In the following weeks, Tara leads her 
group
 to Oceanside to gather guns from the community's armory. When bombs begin to go off in the outskirts of Oceanside, Kathy and Beatrice attempt to run towards the armory but they are stopped by 
Daryl
, who tells them to put their hands behind the head. She obeys him and is brought to the woods with the other Oceanside residents.

When Natania and Cyndie talk about fighting the 
Saviors
, Kathy seems somewhat interested in joining the battle. Shortly after, she is among the survivors to help defend the Oceanside residents from 
walkers
. After the deal is over, Kathy watches as the 
Alexandrians
 take their guns.

Worth
"


Upon returning from fishing, Kathy and some Oceansiders watch as an emaciated and weak Aaron kills a walker nearby before collapsing. Having been spotted in the area often by the women, Aaron is ignored except for Beatrice to tell him to find something to drink. Later that day, Kathy and the residents find an exhausted Aaron, begging them to join the fight against the Saviors as they would otherwise continue to be fearful of the outside world.

Aaron
