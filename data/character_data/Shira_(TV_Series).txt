Overview
[
]


Shira, while pretending to be Stephanie Vega, initially comes off as a kind, bubbly and caring woman who cares about 
Eugene
. She acts extremely friendly and kind to the group, especially Eugene. The two eventually enter a relationship. She helps him and the group on many occasions such as helping them get to a radio to contact their group, having 
Hornsby
 protect them from banishment, and taking part in their punishment.

However, once Shira's cover is blown is shown to be a cold, cunning, cruel, unsympathetic, and dangerous woman. It is revealed that she only was with Eugene to get information about his communities and that she merely using him. Shira is shown to be a very remorseless woman when after Eugene finds out who she really is, she tackles him to the floor, not showing any remorse or emotion despite their seemingly genuine relationship. She acts as one of Lance Hornsby's spies and will carry out any task necessary under his orders, even if that means hurting and killing others, including children. After being ordered to go after Daryl, she and Roman Calhoun go after the group's children, 
Judith
, 
R.J.
, and 
Gracie
.

Shira is also a cruel murderer who will kill anyone necessary. She and Roman execute 10 innocent Commonwealth janitors to have them reanimate and cause chaos under Lance's orders, which leads to the deaths of many more people, including 
Pamela
's son, 
Sebastian Milton
.

"
Acheron: Part II
"
[
]


Shira pretending to be 
"Stephanie"
 enters the train car and meets 
Eugene Porter
 for the first time. Eugene, believing Shira is the companion he had befriended over the radio, is excited to see her as she asks which one of the new arrivals he is and introduces herself accordingly.



"
Out of the Ashes
"
[
]


Shira is seen walking with Eugene, while he gets familiar with the Commonwealth. They both get ice cream at an ice cream truck. Eugene asks Shira for advice on how to leave the Commonwealth. She offers to help him radio his people but says it could take a couple of weeks to get him access. Ezekiel and Princess inform Eugene that they won't be able to speak to the case supervisor for five weeks. Eugene asks Shira if she can get him unofficial access to the radio. 
Mercer
 suspiciously watches them from afar.

Shira brings Eugene, 
Ezekiel
 and 
Princess
 to the 
train station
, which now serves as headquarters for various Commonwealth agencies. Princess distracts Mercer while Eugene and Shira contact Rosita and Judith back at Alexandria, although the connection dies as Eugene and Shira are arrested by Mercer and his fellow troopers.

Eugene, Princess and Ezekiel are threatened with deportation from the Commonwealth. Shira and 
Hornsby
 enter the room. Hornsby orders the supervisor to release Eugene's group. Shira tells them that Hornsby can protect them from banishment but that they'll still have to pay for their crimes.



"
Promises Broken
"
[
]


Shira and Eugene clear walkers in an abandoned building as part of their punishment for breaking the law. Eugene asks Shira if 
Hornsby
 is trustworthy. Shira assures Eugene that Hornsby can help them. Ezekiel coughs and doubles over in pain. Shira seeks Hornsby for medical help. They see 
Mercer
 escorting a young well-groomed couple across the grounds. Hornsby assigns Eugene and Shira to a new location.

Shira and Eugene see walkers approaching the well-groomed man and woman they saw earlier with Mercer; they're busy making out in a gazebo. Eugene and Shira kill the walkers. The man, 
Sebastian
, yells at them for interrupting his date, and says he has private security to protect them from walkers. Shira kills another walker, splattering blood on 
Kayla
. Sebastian screams at her for that and Eugene punches him, which a shock Shira questions what he has done. Hornsby and Mercer race over as troopers surround Eugene.



"
Rogue Element
"
[
]


Stephanie has entered a relationship with Eugene and he tells her he loves her; shortly after she says she loves him too, she mysteriously disappears. Eugene becomes obsessed with finding Stephanie and breaks into a man's house looking for evidence, but fails and Princess insists that she must have broken up with and abandoned him. Eugene soon finds Stephanie again colluding with 
Lance
 for an unknown task, and gets Lance to confess "Stephanie" was a plant named Shira who was used to get Eugene to confess the location of 
Alexandria
 due to too many inconsistencies during the group's auditing. Hornsby apologizes for the deception, but points out that Eugene's group is now thriving at the Commonwealth.



"
The Lucky Ones
"
[
]


In a flashback, Shira, posing as "Stephanie" purchases ice cream from the Taste of Tradition ice cream truck for her and Eugene as a forlorn Max watches on.



"
Lockdown
"
[
]


Shira and Roman walk over 
Carol
's house trying to track down 
Daryl
, ordered by Lance to do so and capture him. However, Carol notices them and manages to hide the kids before they can find them. Shira and Roman enter the apartment and find it empty. They search around and Shira asks if Lance said anything else, but Roman says Daryl was the only name that came through. Roman then sees a photo of Daryl with 
Judith
 and 
R.J.
 and takes it as a reference. Shira looks out the window and fails to notice Carol standing right next to it outside. As Roman looks at the photo, it's revealed the kids are hiding in a cabinet. Shira suggests they check the school and they leave.

Later, during the protests, as soldiers force everyone to go into lockdown, Roman spots 
Jerry
 and the kids amongst the crowd and informs Shira.



"
A New Deal
"
[
]


Shira and Roman enter a gated off area where ten Commonwealth janitors are gathering. Without saying a word, Shira and Roman shoot and kill the ten with silenced pistols and then leave them to reanimate. The two later catch 
Lance
's attention with a whistle and Shira gives Lance a salute, signifying the success of their mission.



"
Variant

Trivia
[
]


This character is credited as 
Decoy Stephanie
 for "
Acheron: Part II
" and "
Out of the Ashes
".

Shortly after the promo photos for "Out of the Ashes" were released, AMC re-credited this character as 
Stephanie
 in an attempt to avoid giving away any plotline spoilers.


Shira (aka Decoy Stephanie) being fair-skinned is most likely a joke reference to the 
comic series
 drawing error of 
Stephanie
 - in which her skin tone was off when introduced 
Issue 176
, appearing as Caucasian, but later fixed in 
Issue 178
, appearing as African-American.
