Overview
[
]


A worker at the 
Sanctuary
, Mark is seemingly a loyal member of the 
Saviors
. However, he secretly defies the rules and is in a secret relationship with 
Amber
, one of 
Negan
's wives. Because of this, Mark is made an example to others what happens when people break the rules and has his face burned by the iron. Mark is shown to fear Negan so much to the point of peeing his pants.

Location Unknown

Nothing is known about Mark's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[

Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Mark somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined upon where he was appointed as one of the Sanctuary guards, during where he developed a relationship with his fellow survivor 
Amber
.

Due to her mother needing medication and not being able to work, Amber volunteered to become one of 
Negan
's "wives" to get things for free to provide for her mother. However, Mark and Amber still had lingering feelings for each other.



Season 7

"
Sing Me a Song
"
[

When Mark shifts his work duties to be with Amber, he is discovered by Negan and is punished for having broken the rules. He is tied to a chair near the furnace on the factory floor surrounded by the crowd of Saviors and workers. After Negan gives a speech of the rules, he presses a hot iron against Mark's face, burning the left side of it. Mark screams in agony, wets his pants, and passes out. Afterwards, Negan orders 
Dr. Carson
 to tend to Mark's injury.

Having becoming trapped inside the Sanctuary, Mark helps
