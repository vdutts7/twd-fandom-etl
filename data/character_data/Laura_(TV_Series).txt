Overview
[
]


Laura is shown to be an intelligent, cunning and initially cruel person who is a strong, determined survivor. She is described as having a wild and reckless side and enjoys having "fun" as seen when she plays table hockey with Dwight. She is shown to have a somewhat of a free-spirited side as seen when she flirted with 
Spencer
 and offered to take him back to her compound presumably in order to get together with him, although it seems this was more a result of him actually scavenging supplies and fulfilling Negan's orders rather than genuine interest in him.

Laura demonstrated extreme loyalty to the Saviors and seemed to fully support their savage lifestyle and was shown to be cruel to the members of communities that her group extorted from. This was seen when she threatened 
Eugene
 and held Rick at gunpoint in order to prevent him from interfering with 
Aaron
 being brutally beaten. Her loyalty is further proven as she is easily angered at any disrespect towards her group, and being apathetic towards the extreme violence that Negan and the Saviors commonly engaged. Forcing Eugene to watch Negan burn 
Emmett Carson
 alive while he tried to look away in horror. She is likely a murderer herself and would've killed Dwight after he betrayed their group following the attack on Alexandria by making them fall in to ambush led by Daryl. Laura escaped the ambush and made it a personal mission to make it back to the Sanctuary despite being injured in order to gain revenge and expose him as 
the Militia
's spy. She has no remorse and will rat out anyone who falls out of line. 

In spite of her loyalty to Negan, she is not fundamentally a bad person who wishes for the extermination of the other communities. After suffering heavy losses, Laura leads the Saviors in surrendering to 
the Militia
 and fully embraces the peace with the other communities. When people from the other communities arrive at the Sanctuary, Laura, now working as a gardener, goes so far as to give 
Rosita Espinosa
 a friendly nod and shows no ill will towards her former enemies.

A year and a half after Negan's defeat, Laura is shown to be fully reformed and often acts as a mediator between the Saviors and the rest of the communities, preferring to solve conflicts peacefully. During the bridge construction, she and Arat are the only Saviors to show no hostility towards the other survivors and, in fact, try to deescalate the conflict. She also doesn't join 
Jed
 and the other Saviors when they go back to the campsite to raid it. Six years later, she is fully integrated into and trusted by Alexandria and has become a member of its leadership council.



Pre-Apocalypse

Location Unknown
[
]


Nothing is known about Laura's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had a boyfriend and was adopted by 
Franklin
.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse after losing her boyfriend, Laura joined a group named "the Saviors" where she was appointed as one of Negan's personal lieutenants. She had previously met Negan, as well as giving him the baseball bat that became Lucille.

Laura aided her group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.

Hearts Still Beating
"


Laura is stationed at the front gate with 
Gary
, 
David
, and other Saviors as they wait to inspect the offering from the Alexandrians. When 
Spencer
 returns and shows what he scavenged to Gary, she steps in and starts flirting with Spencer, offering to take him back to her compound if he "plays his cards right". She then catches 
Eugene
 watching them from a short distance away and angrily orders him to walk away or else. 

When 
Rick
 and 
Aaron
 arrive with a truck full of supplies, Laura goes through the goods until she finds a note that reads "congrats for winning, but you still lose". Enraged at the disrespect, Gary and David proceed to brutally beat Aaron, believing the note was intended for them, as Laura holds 
Rick
 at gunpoint to stop him from intervening.



"
Hostiles and Calamities
"


When a captured Eugene is brought to the 
Sanctuary
, Laura shows him around and takes him to his private apartment on Negan's orders. As he explores his new digs, Laura reveals that 
Daryl
 has escaped and asks Eugene if he knows his whereabouts but he denies to know because otherwise, he will confess the truth. She then offers to bring him a meal of his choosing for which he settles for canned pasta in tomato sauce. 

Later that day, Laura shows Eugene around the factory floor and explains the Saviors' point system before giving him a jar of pickles. When Eugene is brought before Negan, Laura laughs at him and responds with her fellow Saviors in unison that her name is Negan. She later escorts Eugene to the factory floor where she forces him to watch as 
Dr. Carson
 is accused of freeing Daryl and is thrown into the furnace and burnt to death as a result of his actions.

"
The Big Scary U
"


Having becoming trapped inside the Sanctuary, the Savior lieutenants discuss how to rescue Negan, how to handle the workers, and the possibility of a spy among their ranks, when Laura bursts into the room, warning everyone that the workers are coming up the stairs to express their demands. She and the others try to calm the angry workers down and even draws her gun on them when Regina shoots one of the workers attempting to shoot Simon.

Laura, Arat, and Gary later inform Negan and the lieutenants that a Savior took weapons from the armory and armed the workers.

 barricade a set of doors in the Sanctuary as the herd idles outside. Later that day, she informs Eugene that Negan has summoned him to the meeting room.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


When Eugene's plans successfully divert the herd away from the Sanctuary, Laura along with Dwight are among the Saviors stationed in the back of Alexandria. When the Alexandrians plow through the walls, Laura and the others chase after them. After seeing a blockade in the road, Laura tells Dwight to stop, suspecting an ambush, but Dwight refuses to do so. As a result, they are caught up in an ambush, and she witnesses Dwight gun down his fellow Saviors. She shoots Dwight in the arm and accuses him of being the mole before being forced to flee.



"
Still Gotta Mean Something
"


Laura is found by 
Negan
 a few days later walking alone along the side of the road as he drives towards the Sanctuary. He stops the car and comments on her overall state and invites her into the car to return home. Along the way, Laura reveals Dwight's betrayal and his true identity as the mole of

D.J.
 to keep quiet about Laura's return so she may recover peacefully.



"
Worth
"

Wrath
"


Laura acts as 
Negan
's driver to the ambush point and listens to his "confession" to 
Gabriel
. After Laura is forced to swerve due to a walker, Gabriel makes an attempt to escape and is nearly killed by another walker. Laura shows up with 
Eugene
 and kills the walker, saving Gabriel's life, before they continue towards the ambush point. While Negan gives a speech to Rick and the militia, Laura holds 
Dwight
 at gunpoint to force him to watch the massacre. 

When Laura attempts to open fire, her handgun explodes due to having been loaded with faulty ammunition manufactured by Eugene. She manages to survive, unlike many other Saviors. After a short battle, Laura offers the remaining Saviors' surrender to the Militia due to being outnumbered and tired. She then watches on as Negan is defeated and captured while Rick addresses the crowd, declaring peace among all communities. 

Following the end of the war, Laura is tending to the 
Sanctuary
 gardens when people from the other communities arrive to help. She gives 
Rosita
 a friendly nod, having fully committed herself to moving past the conflict and rebuilding together.

"
A New Beginning
"


During the year and a half that passed since the end of the 
war
, Laura started to work on the Sanctuary under 
Daryl
's orders. While 
Arat
 and 
Justin
 hang a walker in the crops to serve as a scarecrow, Laura helps out by informing Daryl. When 
Rick
 and the 
group
 arrive at the Sanctuary to deliver farming equipment later that day, Laura tries to encourage Daryl to give a speech to the crowd about the successful supply run, but he snaps at her and refuses to act like Negan, before quietly letting her know they just lost a fellow survivor, in which Laura understands and nods in reply.



"
The Bridge
"


Having moved from the Sanctuary to the work camp along with several other residents, Laura is part of the team of laborers working to build a bridge connecting the communities' trade routes. One morning as Rick travels through the camp, she prepares a cup of coffee for 
Arat
 as soon as she emerges from her tent after waking up. When a group of walkers suddenly ambushed the lumber yard, Laura is among those to arrive in time to save 
Daryl
, 
Jed
, another Savior, and the injured 
Aaron
. That night, she socializes with 
Regina
 and 
Jed
 around a campfire.



"
Warning Signs
"


While searching for a missing Justin around the woods, Laura and a small group of Saviors encounter 
Maggie
 and 
Kal
 on their way to deliver food to the Sanctuary. She looks on as 
Jed
 attempts to intimate Maggie by stealing one of the tomatoes from the supply cart. After questioning her about their missing people, Laura and the other Saviors let her pass and continue searching for their missing comrade around the area.

When the work camp is informed of Justin's death, Laura and Arat try to calm the Saviors as they become furious and start accusing Daryl and 
Anne
 of being the culprits. They grab axes to retaliate when Rick rides in the middle of the group with his gun drawn and warns everyone to back off. Laura disarms Jed and tells him to calm down.



"
Who Are You Now?
"


At some point following Rick's assumed death, the Sanctuary eventually falls as a community and Laura is among the Saviors that decide to move to Alexandria for a new beginning where she also became a member of the community council. Six years later, Laura, along with Rosita, Eugene, and Aaron, look for Judith in the woods after looking for supplies when they find her helping a 
group of strangers
 escape from a nearby herd. As Judith argues they are in need of help, they ultimately agree to bring the group back to Alexandria despite the protocol regarding strangers.

The next day, Laura and the rest of the council question the newcomers to vote on whether or not they should be allowed to stay. However, they are left shocked when 
Michonne
 reveals that Magna's hand tattoo means she was once in prison before the apocalypse and that she is also hiding a knife in her belt.

Connie
, 
Henry
, and 
Lydia
 arrive at Alexandria for medical assistance, Laura watches them from her post and voices concern on wherever to allow them inside when Michonne accepts due to her trust in Daryl.

"
Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Laura is among the council members to enter the meeting house as the 
teacher
 is going over her lessons with Lydia, Gracie, and several other Alexandrian children. The council announces they need to cut class short as they need the space to hold an emergency meeting regarding the discovery of a Whisperer mask in Oceanside. Upon seeing 
Lydia
, Laura questions her need to be there and the council kicks her out.

After the meeting is over, Laura and several Alexandrians witness the satellite fall from the sky. The next day, Laura is among the Alexandrians that arrive at the crash site to help put out the fire and take out the walker threat. 



"
Ghosts
"


Laura, alongside the coalition soldiers and Alexandria residents, faces against waves of walkers pouring onto the community gates over the next 49 hours. At first, Laura and 
Gage
 are dispatched to take care of a small group of walkers. After the exhausting battle, Gage celebrates by fooling around with his weapon as he and Laura share a laugh. However, they soon notice more incoming walkers and Laura radios back to the community that a new herd of walkers is approaching from multiple directions. In the morning, Laura helps to clean up the community from the corpses while 
Eugene
 warns that it will be an hour until the next wave hits. 

Later that day at an emergency council meeting, Laura listens as Michonne decides that instead of retaliating against the Whisperers, she and a small group will meet with Alpha at the border to work things out. That night, Laura is among the group that arrives at the border to meet with Alpha. After Carol attempts to kill Alpha, Laura and the rest are forced to retreat and spend the night in the woods.

When Carol claims she saw some Whisperers nearby, the group seeks shelter inside an abandoned school. A while later, Laura and the others hear Carol's cries for help and enter the gymnasium to find her standing on top of several walkers she has killed. She and the rest then travel back to Alexandria so Carol can be treated at the infirmary and rest properly.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Laura is at the dining hall enjoying a meal when Lydia makes a scene by gutting a dead squirrel, upsetting Gage, Margo, and Alfred. She watches as the three leave in disgust before returning to her meal.

Later that night, Laura and the council reunite in the meeting house to discuss Lydia's attack. They question Gage and Alfred, who lie and say they were attacked. Gabriel asks why Lydia's the one in the infirmary. They claim to them how their friends got beheaded by the Whisperers and now Margo is dead. The council then lets them go.

When the council discusses their vote on Negan's fate, Laura is in favor of sparing Negan after explaining her own motives. After Daryl ties the vote, she listens as Gabriel announces he'll make a decision by tomorrow.



"
The World Before
"


Laura attends the funeral service for Siddiq and listens to Gabriel's religious remarks. Standing with 
Barbara
 and Nora, she silently pays her respects and then leaves the ceremony.



"
Stalker
"


Laura is present in the meeting hall to discuss a possible plan when 
Gamma
 tells everything she knows about the cave and its entrances. When Gabriel proposes to Laura and Scott to send two rescue teams, Rosita says she doubts the authenticity of her words. Laura then listens in shock as Gabriel encourages them to capture any Whisperer and brutally torture them until they can break them since he believes the Whisperers are cowards. 

Sometime later that day, Laura is informed by Echo Post about a hundred-walker herd incoming. She wants to double-check the message, but receives no response. As they think about this situation, Laura asks for the recent guard shifts. While starting to draft people for the scout team, Gabriel changes the plan at the last minute and orders for Laura and Rosita to stay back with a skeleton crew while he and others will head out on the recon mission. 

That night, Laura helps Rosita deal with the undead residents as they roam around the streets of the community. Shortly after, she goes to the cell to check on Gamma and threatens 
Beta
 with an ax, allowing Gamma to leave and get help. Beta immediately knocks the ax away and starts to leave when Laura jumps on him to prevent him from leaving. However, he overpowers her and slams her back against the cell door twice, killing her.



"
What We Become
"


Laura makes an appearance in Michonne’s hallucinations after she is poisoned by Virgil. Laura appears alongside Negan and D.J. when they find Michonne in the woods and take her in as a Savior. Laura also appears asleep at the satellite outpost in a room with Michonne. Glenn and Heath sneak in and proceed to murder Laura in her sleep before Michonne wakes up.



"
Here's Negan
"


In a flashback, about six months into the apocalypse, Laura is part of a mobile medical unit with her 
father
 and several other doctors, traveling around Virginia and delivering medical aid to survivors while keeping supplies hidden away in a secure warehouse. As Negan attempts to ambush Franklin to secure medicine for his sick 
wife
, Laura sneaks up behind Negan and disarms him with a baseball bat. As Negan recovers in a trailer after being captured, Laura goes out to the warehouse to bring back a cooler of chemotherapy drugs for Lucille. Once Negan recovered enough, she accompanies him and Franklin outside, and gives Negan the baseball bat she used to attack him with. She wishes Negan luck and he leaves the camp, beginning the trek home. When Negan is captured, he is forced to reveal the mobile medical unit's route, leading to the capture of Laura and Franklin. As Negan is let go from captivity, he heads outside to return home and hears Laura screaming from inside the trailer, being attacked by Viper gang members. Laura is eventually freed from the 
Valak's Vipers
 when Negan returns and kills all of the thugs, including their leader, 
Craven
.

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Diana
.
[1]
[2]


Originally, Laura was set to appear in two episodes only, but she was kept on as a recurring character.


Laura is one of five 
Savior
 lieutenants to renounce her antagonistic ways, the others being 
Dwight
, 
Eugene Porter
, 
Arat
, and 
D.J.


Laura was the last known former Savior lieutenant to die.


Laura is one of nine characters to die in the 
TV Series
 who does not die in the comics, the others being 
Sophia Peletier
, 
Mikey
, 
Carl Grimes
, 
Paul Rovia
, 
Siddiq
, 
Earl Sutton
, 
Sebastian Milton
 and 
Lance Hornsby
.


While not officially confirmed, 
Lindsley
 decided that Laura's neck tattoo is a meaningful symbol of her former boyfriend, who belonged to a Pacific Islander tribe.
[3]


Laura was in a number of deleted scenes including:
[4]


In "
Time for After
", after the 
herd
 breaks into the 
Sanctuary
, Laura thinks she and everyone else are going to die, so she enters Eugene's room and tells him "Don't think too highly of this – I'm only doing it because we're gonna die" and they proceed to have sex.


In a 
Season 10
 episode, scenes were filmed involving Laura and 
Rosita
 killing 
zombies
 together and becoming friends, as well as a scene where Laura saves Rosita's life in "Stalker".


She is the one who gave 
Negan
 his infamous baseball bat dubbed as 
Lucille
.


Aside from Negan himself, she is the first member of what would later become the Saviors.


Originally, Dwight was set to appear in "
Here's Negan
", but due to conflict with the 
Fear the Walking Dead
 filming schedule, the 
actor
 was unable to film. As a result, Laura was brought back since she was the most sympathetic former Savior and her backstory as part of a mobile medical unit made the most sense with her character.


Laura appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
"
