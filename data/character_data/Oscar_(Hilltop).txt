Upon finding a downed tree, Oscar remains alert and checks the surrounding area. He then helps chop the tree into pieces to clear the road.

Later that day, a small herd of walkers approaches the group. They get in position and remind themselves to watch for 
the Whisperers
. Suddenly, 
the Highwaymen
 ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara after helping to take down the herd. They then escort them to the Kingdom, having accepted

"
The Calm Before
"


Oscar watches from the crowd as 
Ezekiel
 declares they've finally accomplished Rick, Carl, and Jesus' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds.

Later that day, Oscar and a group prepare to leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. He then fist bumps Tara goodbye. In the woods, Oscar and the rest encounter 
Ozzy
, 
Alek
, and 
D.J.
 and find one of Hilltop's carts overturned. The group decides to split up, with Oscar going to the Hilltop.

The next day, Oscar listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news about the fate of the missing fair attendees, tells them how brave the victims were in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.

He joins several dozen soldiers and militia on the frontlines and helps kill as many zombies as he can along the barbed wire fences. After getting the call to retreat, he and the others flee back towards the gates but are quickly stopped in their tracks as fire arrows ignite the walls and ground around them.

With the parts assembled, the music is turned on and Oscar escorts the wagon alongside his fellow survivors, providing protection from incoming threats.
