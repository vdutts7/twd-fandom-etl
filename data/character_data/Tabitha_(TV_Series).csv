Eastman
's cabins. Morgan tries to steal her, presumably to kill her, before Eastman shouts out from near his cabin for Morgan to stop. Eastman explains to Morgan that he needs Tabitha so that he can find out how to make cheese. Every night, Eastman brings Tabitha inside so that she doesn't get eaten by walkers.
Tabitha is attacked by walkers a few days after Morgan arrives at the cabin. After a struggle with the walkers, Morgan saves Tabitha from being killed. As time goes by, Tabitha is given a cage inside the cabin that Morgan had previously been locked in. She is looked after by both Eastman and Morgan. However, Tabitha is later killed by a walker after escaping her cage whilst Eastman is digging graves for walkers in a different area. She is buried in Eastman's graveyard by Morgan.","Killed By
