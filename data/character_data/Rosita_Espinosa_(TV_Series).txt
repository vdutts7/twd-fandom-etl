You know, I never really knew my dad. And my mom 
died
 when... I was a little older than you are now. I still miss her all the time. For a long time, it was just the two of us. And we moved a lot, from job to job. But she always managed to keep us going. I didn't know it then, but... she was teaching me to 
survive on my own
. So I'd be okay if she ever wasn't there. And 
Carl

 did the same thing for you. So you'd always be able to get though the tough times. Pieces of wood are nice. But you don't need that to remember how much they loved you. Besides, I'm really good at fixing things.

Overview
[
]


Rosita is a feisty, brave, and extremely capable survivor with a sassy nature. She mostly appears hot-headed and single minded about the situation she is placed in. She has little room for humor and shows little hesitation in killing a posed threat.

Despite her seriousness and rather sharp attitude, Rosita greatly cares for the members of her group, as demonstrated by her actions in helping Abraham and Eugene reconcile. She did not hold anger towards Eugene for lying and, more recently, saved Abraham's life after a messy breakup, showing she is compassionate.

Rosita heavily relies on other people and it is clear that she has little experience being by herself. Perhaps the first time she was ever alone, Rosita reacted with anger, which can also perhaps indicate she is good at dealing with other people's emotional situations (such as Abraham's and Eugene's), but not so much her own.

After watching Abraham and Glenn get beaten to death by Negan, Rosita became consumed by vengeance. Despite the fact it could cause more death to her community, she refuses to bow down to the Saviors, and recklessly attempts to kill Negan, even though the Saviors would immediately slaughter Alexandria if she had succeeded. She also became much more snide and cold to even those that she was close to, shown by how she blew off 
Sasha
 and 
Tara
.

However, by the eighth season, Rosita, having been hugely affected by Sasha's sacrifice, becomes a more level-headed survivor, as she states she has learned from her past mistakes of being angry. She even argues with 
Daryl
's plan to attack 
the Sanctuary
, believing it's way too risky and saying that they should follow the original plan, stating that she believes in 
Rick
, as well as that she doesn't want to be a part of Daryl's plan anymore and eventually decides to go back to 
Alexandria
.

Later, Rosita tells Daryl, 
Michonne
, and Tara that she didn't stop them from attacking the Sanctuary, because she wanted them to learn from their mistake, just like she had previously learned from hers. Following her integration to the 
Commonwealth
, Rosita is trying her best to return to the life before the outbreak, but she still remains curious about the true intentions behind the leaders of the community, while trying to make things work for the people around her.

Not much is known about Rosita's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had a six-year-old nephew, as well as a brother. She didn’t know her father well and was raised solely by her mother for the first part of her life. Her mother died when she was either almost a teenager or in her early teens. Following that, her and the rest of her family moved around a lot. She has also had past military experience,
[2]
 indicating that she may have served as a soldier. Additionally, she has demonstrated that she has a proficient knowledge of engineering, suggesting that she could have been a mechanic or at least had some mechanical training.



Post-Apocalypse

Dallas, 
Texas
[

At some point during the outbreak, Rosita joined a group of survivors consisting of 
Josiah
, 
Stephanie
, 
Warren
, 
Rex
, 
Pam
, 
Roger
, 
Dirk
, and 
Josephine
. During her time with the group, she was taught the skills essential for her survival as well as her ability to serve as a medic.

While traveling through Houston, Rosita and her group were fighting off a group of walkers until they were rescued by Abraham and Eugene. Impressed by her skills, Abraham requested her aid and informed her of a potential cure which gave Rosita a sense of purpose. As a result, she and her group joined forces with Abraham to help take Eugene to Washington, D.C. During her travels from Texas to Georgia, her group suffered repeated casualties, leaving Rosita as the sole survivor of her original group. During this time, she developed a closer bond with Abraham and eventually fell in love with him, thus allowing Abraham to move on from the emotional trauma that stemmed from his family's deaths.

Rosita is making a weapon trying to escape the train car, made by removing her earrings and attaching them to a belt. After the attempt to escape fails, she remains trapped in the boxcar. Later in the episode, Sasha asks Eugene about the cure, to which Rosita replies they don't have to know. When Rick, Daryl, Glenn and Bob comes to the rescue, Rosita joins them in their escape and kills walkers. Then she runs to the fence, finding a way to climb over and out of Terminus, therefore saving the group from being trapped inside with the walkers. For the rest of the episode Rosita is mostly in the background because Abraham, Eugene and she are still outsiders. When Rick tells the group they need to leave, Abraham tells her they'll let him know about the mission to D.C. later.



"

Rick says they can't take the bus, leading to an argument with Abraham. Abraham gets aggressive, and Rosita tries to stop him. When Tara, Maggie and Glenn tells them that they're going with them if they just wait 12 hours. Abraham agrees with the plan, and they stay. When Rick and the others are on their way to slaughter the Hunters, Rosita stays at the church, where she's one of the very few that has a weapon. When Gareth and the Hunters get in the church, he mentions Rosita's name knowing she is there. Right before the Hunters break into the room where they are staying, Rick comes back and saves them. The next day, Rosita, Abraham, Eugene, Maggie, Tara, and Glenn head to Washington, D.C.



"
Self Help
"


On the bus, Rosita flirts with Abraham, teasing him about his hair; and she promises to cut it that evening. The bus then crashes and flips over. She leaves the bus with Maggie and begins killing walkers. Abraham orders Rosita to check Eugene but he insists he's fine. When everyone leaves she stays behind whilst Eugene spits on the walker. Later that night Maggie gives Rosita a piece of book thread so she can stitch up Abrahams hand. Rosita stitches his arm and remarks that some former members of their group taught her these medic skills. Whilst Rosita and Abraham are having sex that night she points out that Eugene is watching them again, and that he's in, of all places, the self-help section. They laugh together - not unkindly - and carry on.

Rosita checks Abe's hand the next day and argues that they should rest for that day. Abraham is not interested and insists they carry on. Rosita's clearly not happy with his response but is quick to back him up when, a few moments later, Maggie and Glenn enter and make the same suggestion, showing support for him. Rosita points out that the air intake for the fire truck they're trying to get moving is on the roof, and not where Abraham is fiddling with. When walkers attack she fights some off before Eugene deals with them. Later when they see the large herd of walkers she argues with Abraham that they need to go around the herd, disagreeing with him in front of the others for the first time. When things start to get physical she still argues with him; at one point Abraham pushes her to the ground as he's frog marching Eugene back to the fire truck, clearly shocking her. When Eugene reveals that he's been lying all along Rosita is shocked. She insists he is a scientist and angrily points out that many people died trying to get him to DC. When Abraham beats Eugene unconscious, it's Rosita who blocks his way from hurting Eugene more, with her hand on her sidearm. She then tries to wake Eugene up.



"
Crossed

Rosita offers Abraham water, which he hits away. She shouts at him and he stands up, looking threatening. Maggie makes him back away from Rosita. Later on her, Glenn and Tara trek to a river to refill their water supplies. They come across a few walkers trapped under a pole where Tara makes a joke about them not needing to get up as there is nothing for them in D.C. Rosita does not approve of the joke. At the river the water is full of mud and dirt, but Rosita knows how to make a water filter because Eugene showed her how. While filtering water, Rosita talks to them about when she first met Abraham. When they discover fish in the water, they head back to the walkers and kill them to take their clothes and make a net. Rosita and Glenn use the net to catch a fish, which Rosita knows how to clean. Glenn tells her that's a useful skill for wherever they end up, telling her that whatever happens with Eugene and Abraham, she's welcome to be a part of their group. They then head back to the fire truck.

Rosita also mentions how Michonne is not carrying her sword. After seeing many dead walkers, Rosita realizes that it was Sasha who did this, due to her notice of how the walkers have been killed.

"
Heads Up
"


Rosita offers machete lessons to a group of Alexandrians. Eugene attends, but recoils at the weapon and admits he's scared of dying.

Rosita later appears with Tara as they look in horror when they see the Alexandria bell tower collapse and destroy a part of the wall.



"
Start to Finish
"


Rosita helps drag Tobin to safety when the walls fall down and the herd enters Alexandria. She and Tara then rescue Eugene and take refuge in a nearby garage, trapped in there by the walkers. Rosita is beginning to give up hope but Tara encourages her to keep going and the trio start working to escape the garage.

"
Not Tomorrow Yet

Inside their home, Abraham packs his bag and tells Rosita that he's leaving her. Rosita cries, demanding an explanation. "When I met you, I thought you were the last woman on Earth," Abraham says. "You're not." The next day out on the road, Rosita and Carol have a conversation about Morgan. She tells her that she nearly blurted out Morgan's secret about the W Man at the church meeting. "He doesn't want to kill," Carol says. Rosita then begrudgingly agrees not to tell anyone. When it's already night time, Rick and his group, including Rosita silently infiltrate the Savior's outpost, killing some the Saviors asleep. When the alarm has been pulled, awaking most of the Saviors, Rosita is seen firing at the enemies. At one point, she saves Aaron by shooting a large Savior in the head. After the aftermath of the battle, Rosita is standing outside of the building, bidding goodbye to Tara and Heath for their supply run. Just then, a Savior who managed to survive from the battle tries to escape with a motorcycle that belongs to Daryl. Rosita shoots the Savior from the bike as Daryl beats him into submission. Daryl asks where did he get the motorcycle from. Just then a voice from the Savior's walkie-talkie can be heard, telling Rick to lower his gun and they got Carol and Maggie as hostages.

"

Rosita is present as Carol and Maggie emerge from the Saviors compound. Rosita and Gabriel, go in after them with their weapons ready and begin to look around for any remaining Saviors still alive.



"
Twice as Far
"


Rosita gets out of bed and begins to get ready for the day. Spencer is seen laying in bed after she gets up. The two are implied to be in a sexual relationship. The next day, Spencer asks Rosita to dinner and she reluctantly agrees to it. Denise then finds Daryl and Rosita and discusses with them about a local gift shop/pharmacy she found while driving through the nearby area. They disagree with the plan, but she tells them it's a risk they have to take, and if it really is a pharmacy, there could be drugs inside, which could be used to help Alexandria. They relent, but Denise further insists in accompanying them, noting that she knows her way around and, with her newfound experience with dealing with the undead, can prove to be of assistance. Initially skeptical, Rosita agrees, but only if Daryl comes with them.

They drive-off in a beaten-up truck, and Denise tries to assist Daryl with driving it. Eventually, the trio come across a downed tree and decide to continue to the apothecary on foot. After coming across a set of railroad tracks, Rosita tries to convince Daryl and Denise to take the railroad but Daryl wants to take a pathway which is "twice as far" to reach their destination. Denise initially sides with Rosita's idea of following them to their destination, but decides to stick with Daryl when he rejects the suggestion. Rosita takes the railroad tracks.

Rosita is seen sitting down along the tracks when Daryl and Denise catch up proving that the railroad tracks were a quicker way. Denise apologizes to Rosita for leaving her and says she should have followed her and not Daryl. They eventually make it to the gift shop and Daryl and Rosita begin to salvage abandoned medical supplies from the locked pharmacy. Denise waits outside. The three hear noises coming from one of the back rooms before Denise decides to investigate without telling either of them. Denise runs out of the room scared of seen the walker and the bloody sink to which Daryl and Rosita and her what's up and Denise goes back outside.

Denise is seen waiting outside. Once Daryl and Rosita have collected the needed supplies, the three head off towards Alexandria. Following the railroad tracks home, Denise ventures away and inspects a car, finding a walker and a blue cooler inside. She attempts to call this to attention, but Daryl and Rosita brush it off, deciding that the cooler is not worth the risk of retrieving. Denise regardless of this still goes to get the blue cooler, she struggle as the walker falls on her and begins to scream. Daryl and Rosita run back to Denise to kill the walker but Denise says she has it and kills it. When they open the cooler, a six pack of orange soda comes out and Denise takes them as a prize.

Daryl and Rosita chastise her for taking an unnecessary risk; Denise counters that she was trying to conquer her fears, and reminds them of their life-risking mission of wiping out the Savior outpost. She goes on to explain her reasons for bringing the two with her on the run - Daryl, because he reminded her of her brother and that she felt safer with him, and Rosita, to help her cope with the feeling of being alone for possibly the first time in her life. As she lectures that they, too, need to face their worries and issues due to them being more than capable of doing so, she is suddenly (and accidentally) struck through the back of the head and through her right eye by a crossbow bolt; it does not kill her right away, but she eventually collapses on the tracks. Rosita immediately draws her gun towards where the shot was fired from. Her killer, 
Dwight
, then emerges from the trees next to the tracks, alongside 
Neil
 and several Saviors. He reveals he has Eugene captive and Rosita looks shocked. He tells them to lower their guns or he will kill Eugene and then them. Eugene spots Abraham hiding behind some tires and tells Dwight to kill Abraham first and gives away his location. Dwight's sends some Saviors over to check it out when Eugene bites Dwight in his crotch. Dwight screams out and Abraham, Rosita and Daryl take this as an advantage and begin to open fire on the Saviors. Eugene gets hit during this. After the gun battle and many of his Saviors dying, including Neil, Dwight commands they fall back and Daryl goes to chase after them but Rosita stops him. Abraham, Rosita and Daryl bring Eugene and Denise's corpse back to Alexandria.

Afterwards, Rosita keeps watch over Eugene in the infirmary. After Eugene wakes, Rosita makes sure he is okay. Towards the end of the episode, Rosita guards the front gate instead of Eugene. Sasha glances at Rosita from her post on the platform as the town's cars are lined up by the front gates.



"
East
"


Rosita guards the gate, glancing up at Sasha at the lookout post. Abraham arrives and take over Sasha's shift, and Rosita watches them.

Despite Rosita's protests, Daryl opens the gate and leaves on his motorcycle. As Glenn and Michonne prepare to go after him, Rosita tells Abraham to cover her shift as she claims to know where Daryl is heading.

Rosita, Glenn and Michonne arrive at the spot where Dwight killed Denise. They find Daryl's motorcycle hidden underneath some branches, confirming Rosita's hunch that Daryl came back to kill Dwight. Rosita points in the direction that Dwight escaped, but wonders if they should let Daryl complete his mission.

Rosita, Glenn and Michonne catch up to Daryl in the woods and Rosita is nearly struck in the head by Daryl's crossbow. She reprimands him as the others try to stop him from going after Dwight, but he refuses. Rosita decides to join him.

In the woods, Rosita and Daryl creep up on the Saviors' camp where Glenn and Michonne are being held. Glenn tries to warn them off, but Dwight and another Savior sneak up from behind and point their guns at Daryl and Rosita. As Daryl turns around, Dwight shoots him and a large amount of blood splatters on screen as Dwight says 'you'll be alright."

Rosita watches helplessly as Negan brutally beats Abraham to death. Negan realizes that Abraham was dating Rosita. He starts taunting Rosita with a bloodied Lucille, forcing her to look at it. Daryl suddenly stands up for her and punches Negan for his actions. In retaliation, Negan kills Glenn in the same manner.

Rosita watches on helplessly as Negan returns with Rick, who then threatens her life if Rick does not obey Negan's command to amputate Carl's left arm. After Negan is satisfied, he stops Rick from performing the amputation believing he has become submissive and thus spares Rosita's life along with the others.

When the Saviors leave, Sasha approaches a distraught Rosita and the two lament over Abraham's corpse along with Eugene who is also devastated by the loss of Abraham.

Service

Rosita and Spencer drive up to the gate, preparing to leave for a supply run as Negan and a large group of Saviors arrive at Alexandria. Dwight confiscates Rosita and Spencer's guns and orders them to find Daryl's motorcycle and bring it back. He takes Rosita's hat and pours her water out before they leave.

Out in the woods, Rosita and Spencer find Daryl's motorcycle by the tracks where he had previously hidden it. Spencer begins to question Rick's leadership, unaware that Rosita was heading into the woods as Spencer loads the motorcycle into their van. Rosita hunts down the undead Saviors present during Denise's death and kills them. She takes a gun from 
Neil
's corpse but it has no bullets. Spencer tracks her down and chastises her. Rosita tells him that she's looking for guns on the assumption that Negan will confiscate all the guns in Alexandria.

Rosita and Spencer bring the motorcycle back to Alexandria, and Dwight returns her hat. After Rick chastises Spencer for stealing two guns, Rosita confronts Spencer about them and asks why he didn't mention them. "You saw what I did to get one," she says. Spencer explains that he hid the guns for a while because he didn't trust Rick and he was worried about Rick being in charge. He muses that Rosita was correct; they don't have to live like they are. When he leaves, Rosita reaches into the wheel well of her car, retrieving the gun she took from Neil in the woods.

Later, Rosita picks up an empty shell casing from the gun Negan shot earlier that day and pays Eugene a visit. "Make me a bullet," she says.

Rosita is in the infirmary with Tara as Tara sits on the ground in silence, staring at a bobblehead of a doctor, a gift for Denise.

"
Sing Me a Song
"


Rosita and Eugene are about to leave when Eugene realizes she has no intention of scavenging for Negan. Spencer warns Rosita that they must produce for the Saviors as part of their new "tax." He reminds her it was Rick who got them into this, and she asks if he thinks he can do better, to which he says yes. She chastises him and leaves with a reluctant Eugene. 

Rosita and Eugene arrive at the factory that he had previously taken Abraham to with the intent to manufacture bullets. She orders him to make her one using the shell casing she found in Alexandria. Eugene hesitates and says that a single bullet won't do it as the Saviors have the numbers and someone will pay the price for her actions. Rosita calls him a coward and says he is only alive because he lied and people feel sorry for him. She says she will pay the price and tells him to do something useful for once. Eugene quietly gets to work.

As they approach Alexandria, Rosita thanks Eugene for making a bullet and apologizes. He refuses to accept the apology and says that she meant what she said, now she just feels bad. Spencer drives up and reveals a bounty of supplies and weapons. He whistles towards the gate and a Savior opens it. Rosita realizes that Negan is in Alexandria.

Hearts Still Beating

In the church, Rosita inspects the bullet that Eugene made. Gabriel urges her to refrain from attacking Negan by herself. He recommends she wait for the right moment so the community can take him down together.

Rosita calls out to Spencer as he walks down the street. He reveals that he's planning to get close to Negan so he can strike against him at some point in the future. They talk about their relationship and Rosita agrees to join him for dinner later.

Rosita, along with other residents, gather round as Spencer and Negan play pool in the street. Rosita watches furiously as Negan kills Spencer, and she whips out her gun and shoots at Negan but hits Lucille instead. Arat tackles her to the ground and holds her at knifepoint as Negan demands to know who made the bullet. Rosita claims she made it herself and presses her face against the knife, cutting her cheek. As punishment, Negan tells Arat to kill someone. Rosita protests she made the bullet, but Arat turns and shoots Olivia in the face. Eugene admits to having made the bullet and is taken by the Saviors as Rosita pleads for them to take her instead. 

Rosita accompanies the group as they reunite with the others at the Hilltop. She gives Sasha a reassuring nod, which she returns.

Gregory
 to fight against the Saviors. She cusses him as she leaves his office, and Jesus then tells the group it's time they met King 
Ezekiel
.

Rosita accompanies the group to the Kingdom, where they are reunited with Morgan and meet Ezekiel. During the meeting, Rosita informs Morgan of Abraham, Glenn, Spencer and Olivia's deaths at the hands of Negan. She snidely asks Morgan if he's going to say he was right.

After Ezekiel refuses to fight, Sasha vents to Rosita that she knew he would say no but it still pissed her off. Rosita blows her off and tells her that just because they slept with the same dead guy, it doesn't make them friends.

On their way back from the Kingdom, they encounter a blockade of cars on the highway set up by the Saviors. A tripwire has been rigged across the road; a steel cable is stretched between two cars on opposite sides of the road, explosives carefully strung along the cable. Rosita disconnects the bomb device and leads an effort to dismantle the explosives so they can take the dynamite and RPGs with them. She takes some dynamite away from Tara, commenting that she doesn't like the way it looks. 

As a herd approaches the highway, Rosita, Carl and Tara work to block the onramp again until they are surrounded. They are eventually joined by Rick and Michonne and as they head back to Alexandria, the leftover dynamite explodes behind them. Rosita tells them she knew she didn't like the way it looked.

Once they are back at Alexandria, Aaron and Tobin inform them Gabriel disappeared with most of their food and weapons. Rosita accuses Gabriel of stealing their goods, but Rick defends him.

 hostage. Rosita watches through a tube as Rick is forced to fight a walker covered in metal armor and steel spikes. He later comes back to the group, injured but smiling, and tells them a deal has been made.

Rosita says she will go on her own but Tara says they are sticking together. Rosita asks what her problem is and Tara says they aren't looking for a fight but getting ready for one. Rosita says it's always a fight and tells her to grow up.



"
Say Yes
"


Rosita is on her porch, removing the stitches from the cut on her face. Tara arrives with the intention of helping Rosita remove her sutures. After an awkward pause, Tara assures Rosita that it's going to work out. They have the numbers, they just need the weapons. Rosita asks if she knows where they can find that many guns. Tara says no. Rosita says she can't just wait. Tara again assures her they will find the guns and they will fight and to save her rage for the Saviors. Rosita heads off to find guns.

Out on her own, Rosita scavenges for guns. She spots a gun in the doorway of an old house and goes after it. A walker lunges out at Rosita. She kills the walker and grabs the gun, only to discover that it's a toy. Furious, she hurls the toy gun to the ground.

Back in Alexandria, Rosita visits Gabriel at the church. She yells at him for dissuading her from killing Negan, even though it might have gotten her killed. Gabriel patiently defends himself; he argues that the rest of the group still needs her.

Rosita accompanies the others in delivering the guns to Jadis and her group. She rages when Jadis says it's not enough and they need twice as many. 

Rosita visits Sasha at the Hilltop, seeking her help to kill Negan. Sasha agrees to help on one condition - she gets to take the shot. Rosita agrees and hands Sasha a rifle. She tells her she memorized Daryl and Carl's description of Negan's compound. Sasha says Jesus drew her a map of the compound's exterior. They acknowledge that the mission will likely end in their deaths. Rosita emphasizes, "It's a one way ticket for both of us. If it is both of us."



"
The Other Side
"


Rosita arrives at the Hilltop and tells Sasha she needs her help.

Rosita and Sasha leave the Hilltop through a secret escape hatch. They escape through the woods on foot. Rosita tries to hotwire a car, to no avail. She notices Sasha’s necklace and gruffly points out that she made it for Abraham. As the two continue looking for a ride, Rosita rebuffs Sasha's attempts to make small talk. 

Rosita is reluctant to follow Sasha's plan to hole up in a building near the Sanctuary and shoot Negan from a distance. She argues that they should enter the compound and kill Negan on-site to ensure success.

At an abandoned car lot, Rosita lights a car on fire to distract walkers. She and Sasha climb the fence into the lot, and Rosita hotwires a car. They drive off to the Sanctuary.

Rosita and Sasha situate themselves in an empty building near the Sanctuary. Sasha tells Rosita that Eugene is giving orders to the other Saviors. Rosita is convinced Eugene must be playing some angle.

As they wait for Negan to emerge, Rosita opens up to Sasha, revealing where she learned everything she knows. She learned about bombs, cars, knots etc from men she dated. They wanted to protect her, Rosita tells Sasha, but she always ended up surpassing their skills. 

But, she continues, that wasn't how things were with Abraham, who saw her as she was. Rosita admits that she wasted her time hating Sasha and wishes she could've gotten the chance to tell Abraham she was happy for him. 

When Sasha is unable to get a clear shot of Negan before he goes back inside the Sanctuary, the women decide they need to enter the compound.

That night, Rosita and Sasha kill a Savior accompanying Eugene in the courtyard and attempt to break him free. Eugene refuses and goes back inside, and Rosita curses him in sincere disappointment.

Rosita keeps watch as Sasha slips through the fence. She closes the opening behind her at the last minute, locking Rosita out. Despite Rosita's protests, Sasha tells her it is not her time and that Alexandria still needs her. Rosita watches as Sasha guns down another Savior and breaks into the Sanctuary. Rosita bangs on the fence as gunfire erupts inside the building. As more Saviors arrive, Rosita grabs her bag and runs from the Sanctuary.

Rosita stops and sobs in frustration. She stops and notices 
a dark figure
 with a crossbow watching her.

Rosita, Daryl and Aaron wire explosives in an empty truck outside the Alexandria gate in preparation for the Saviors arrival. 

Rosita, along with the others, look shocked when Eugene arrives with the Saviors, speaking through a megaphone and telling the group to surrender. She shakes her head in disappointment. Rick gives her the signal to detonate the explosives, however when she pushes the button, there is no explosion. The Scavengers then turn their guns on the group. 

When Sasha – who has died and reanimated – attacks Negan, Rosita uses the distraction to gun down the Scavenger behind her before firing at the Saviors outside the gates. She is shot during the firefight, and Tara grabs her by the arm and leads her to the infirmary.

When Eugene keeps insisting on seeing Coco and admits he was part of the team on the gates to protect her, Rosita angrily yells that he isn't Coco's father and they will never be together.

Rosita rests in her house after being checked up by Dante due to being sick with a stomach bug. She uses the radio and manages to contact Eugene who is still at Hilltop. They catch up and she admits to missing talking to him. Suddenly, a part of his radio malfunctions and they agree to talk later. 

Later that day, Rosita gets worse due to the sickness and lays down on her couch while Gabriel is on patrol. When Siddiq arrives at her house to look for new clothes for Coco, he notices an ill Rosita and decides to take her to the infirmary despite her objections. 

Upon arriving at the infirmary to find it full of sick people, Rosita sits on a bed and calms down Siddiq when he berates Dante for letting things get out of hand. She is then taken care of with the other patients for the rest of the day.

Open Your Eyes

Rosita lays sick on her bed at the infirmary and is taken care of by Siddiq during the night. The next day, Siddiq visits her again to check on her health. When Rosita tells him Gabriel isn't jealous, Siddiq lays next to her to keep her company. The two of them joke about their fling and reflect on them being parents in the new world. He nearly kisses her until she has a coughing fit so he gives her more water before leaving to check on his other patients.  

Later that day, Rosita watches as Siddiq jumps into the pond to drown himself. She jumps into the water as well and pulls him out. Shortly after, Rosita questions Siddiq about what's really going on in his mind. He breaks down and explains he can't escape his memories about the night their friends were killed by the Whisperers. She assures him that he is doing everything he can but he says he feels he failed Enid and that he misses her. Rosita demands he pull through and fight it for her and Coco and everyone else. She is then told to go back to her house and rest. 



"
The World Before
"


Rosita goes with Coco to Siddiq's room to check on him but they are greeted on the door by a suspicious Dante who prevents her from coming inside. When he pulls out a knife, Rosita slowly backs away and puts her daughter into a bathtub before she is tackled to the ground. As Dante starts chocking her, a reanimated Siddiq walks over to his crying daughter. Before Coco can be harmed, Rosita stabs Dante in the chest, puts down Siddiq, and then brutally beats Dante until he is knocked unconscious. She then picks up Coco and cries as she looks at Siddiq's dead body.

The next day, Rosita is present during Dante's interrogation in the infirmary after his identity as a Whisperer spy is exposed. She calls him a piece of shit after he claims he is needed because he is their only doctor. When Dante confesses his motive for infiltrating the community and says he's looking forward to them arguing over what to do with him as they did with Negan, Rosita insults him again and kicks him in the back before leaving the room.

Later that day, Rosita attends Siddiq's funeral and listens as Gabriel delivers a moving eulogy. When the ceremony ends, she falls to the ground alone in sadness. Shortly after, Rosita hears walkers banging on the walls and goes outside to kill them using brass knuckles to release her anger out. Before a walker with a helmet almost bites her, she comes to her senses as Eugene arrives to help kill it. He then offers his deepest condolences to her and wishes he could offer more, but says he is unable to at the moment because he is relocating. They say goodbye to each other and he leaves. 

Rosita later arrives at her house and tells Gabriel she almost died fighting walkers recklessly and laments how vulnerable she feels because she doesn't want Coco to be left an orphan. He says that feeling will pass and his main concern at the moment is to deal with Dante. Feeling hurt by his indifference, she claims that maybe Dante was right about them not being as strong as they thought. When he leaves to confront Dante, Rosita carries her daughter to a window and tells her she will grow strong and loved. She then spots Gabriel leaving the cell covered in blood. That night, Rosita approaches Gabriel as he burns Dante's body and puts her head on his shoulder. They reconcile and watch the scene.

Stalker
"


Following Siddiq's death, Rosita starts to suffer from nightmares where she sees herself being killed by Whisperers or sometimes finds herself unable to move as Coco is the one being killed. One morning, she watches as a Whisperer named Gamma arrives to inform everyone that a group has been trapped in the cave with Alpha's horde and explains she wants to help because the baby left at Hilltop is her nephew. Rosita knocks her unconscious and orders for her to be put in a cell. A while later, she and Gabriel visit Gamma in the cell and confront her about Dante's actions. They say she has to prove she's different from the other Whisperers or she'll get killed. When Gabriel insists she is hiding something and calls for a sincere confession, Rosita listens as Gamma tearfully reveals she killed her sister for Alpha.

Rosita is later present in the meeting hall to discuss a possible plan when Gamma tells everything she knows about the cave and its entrances. When Gabriel proposes to Laura and Scott to send two rescue teams, Rosita says she doubts the authenticity of her words. She then listens in shock as Gabriel encourages them to capture any Whisperer and brutally torture them until they can break them since he believes the Whisperers are cowards. Shortly after, Rosita and Gabriel prepare for the outing. He suggests she'd better stay at home but she refuses, adding that he is acting erratic and is itching for a fight. Gabriel doesn't understand her point, and Rosita claims she can feel that Coco is wondering where Siddiq is and she doesn't want her daughter to be left an orphan if both of them die.

Sometime later that day, Rosita listens as Echo Post informs about a hundred-walker herd incoming. As they think about this situation, she reconsiders if she should go outside with the walker threat and risk dying. While starting to draft people for the scout team, Gabriel changes the plan at the last minute and orders for Rosita and Laura to stay back with a skeleton crew while he and others will head out on the recon mission. Before leaving, Rosita tells him she has been having nightmares about the Whisperers killing her and worries about Coco's future. They kiss goodbye.

That night, Rosita leads the rest of the soldiers as they deal with the undead residents roaming around the streets of the community. When the threat is controlled, she heads to the Grimes' house to make sure Judith and R.J. are safe and watches as 
Beta
 attempts to take Gamma away. Holding her sword and ready to fight, Rosita draws his attention and they battle with their weapons for a while until Beta slashes both of her arms and gets her on the ground. Before he can kill her, Gamma tells him to stop or she'll kill herself, saying she knows Alpha wants her alive. Rosita is spared and eventually realizes Gamma was telling the truth, which causes her to grow respect for saving her life.

The following morning, Rosita is now patched up on her arms with bandages and prepares to leave towards Hilltop with a group so she can be checked with by the doctor and receive proper medical treatment in her injuries. She leaves Coco under Gabriel's care as she believes they'll be safe in Alexandria and kisses him goodbye. Mary also hops in the wagon to see her nephew, and she and Rosita introduce themselves and shake hands.

 on the radio attempting to contact Eugene.

Furious that Rosita made him break his promise to Stephanie, Eugene tells her to leave.

Outside the Hilltop, Eugene is calibrating the electric fence when he is greeted by Rosita. She informs him that she talked to Gabriel and that Coco is fine. Eugene asks if she told him about the horde, but she reveals that she didn't. Rosita says that she thought Eugene would be working on the radio, but he reveals that there have been no new transmissions. Rosita supposes that Eugene likes the girl on the radio, but he believes that she won't talk to him again after the earlier debacle. Rosita assures him that the girl likes him, before suddenly inviting Eugene to kiss her. He leans in, but is ultimately unable to go through with it. Eugene notes how peculiar it is to want to kiss someone he has never met, while Rosita finds this endearing. She encourages him to attempt to win Stephanie back.

Right after Stephanie sets up the location and time of their future meeting, which Eugene accepts, Rosita comes to fetch him for the battle, and Eugene confidently follows her, stating that he has a "date".

They assure them that they will fire, in which Rosita responds "Not before I take this asshole's head off." Rosita agrees to do the mission, as long as it's the last thing Sebastian makes them do.

Once in the house, they find the panic room where the money is obtained. Rosita kills two walkers, and notices that they recently turned, meaning someone has sent citizens to do this before.

"
Variant
"

She is taken to a small room, where she is interrogated by Mercer. He demands to know where Eugene is, and lays out the trouble her and the rest of the group will be in, if he isn't found.

As Daryl and Eugene hold up in Gabriel's church, we hear a knock on the door. Daryl pulls his knives out, ready to take on any potential threat, but it's Rosita - revealing she had just lied to Mercer, to protect Eugene. They begin preparing to pack their things, working out a plan on how to escape, when Eugene informs them he will not be leaving without Max. Seeing how adamant he is, Rosita makes a deal with Eugene, that if she can go find her and bring her back, they might be able to sneak them both out. Eugene agrees. 

Later in the episode, we see Rosita finds Max hiding down a small alley. As Max runs towards her, Rosita notices two guards are near-by, so she quickly ushers her to go back into her hiding spot.

As a door opens in the background, Rosita grabs her bag, assuming the group has arrived and ready to leave. She walks into the living room, when all of a sudden she is hit over the head, revealing two men have been sent to her apartment, in an attempt to kidnap her. She fights back, kicking and punching, but is quickly overpowered. A bag is placed over her head, as the episode cuts too black. 



"
Outpost 22
"


In the back of one of the Commonwealth transport trucks, 
Maggie
 wakes up and shakes off her hood, finding 
Gabriel
 and Rosita with her and their guard asleep. Maggie remembers being forcefully separated from 
Hershel
 when the 
Commonwealth soldiers
 had abducted them. Maggie manages to break free of her zip ties and quietly wakes up Gabriel. Unscrewing a piece of metal from the wall, Maggie cuts Gabriel loose who frees Rosita. Rosita and Gabriel jump from the back of the moving truck, but the guard wakes up before Maggie can escape as well and the two struggle over his 
gun
. The gun goes off in the fight, accidentally killing the truck's driver. Finally, Maggie throws the soldier from the back of the truck just before it crashes into a tree. Climbing out, Maggie finds the passenger dead, having been flung from the truck and into the tree by the impact. Maggie attempts to take the driver's gun, but she is forced to flee into the woods as the rest of the Commonwealth convoy approaches.

The next morning, as Gabriel and Rosita lie unconscious in the road, their former guard, now a walker, approaches Rosita who wakes up just in time. Gabriel draws the walker's attention towards him and yanks his helmet off, giving Rosita the chance to grab the soldier's 
machete
 and impale him in the head with it, putting him down. The two quickly begin scavenging the body for his weapons and radio while Gabriel notices that Rosita was injured in the fall from the truck, although she brushes off his concerns. Over the soldier's radio, a soldier from Outpost 41 reports that there's no sign of the dead soldier or the escapees. Another soldier reports in that he has found a set of boot tracks that might be from the dead soldier. Realizing the danger, the two take off down the road before the Commonwealth forces can find them.

Rosita and Gabriel reach the road and Rosita begins following the tracks of the Commonwealth convoy. Gabriel calls for her to hold up, and asks what their plan is. Rosita intends to follow the convoy wherever it goes, but Gabriel points out the foolishness of that plan as there are only just two of them. However, Gabriel doesn't have a better idea and Rosita suggests splitting up in order to cover more ground, but Gabriel refuses to leave her. Two walkers emerge from the woods and Gabriel quickly puts one down, but Rosita suddenly collapses in pain when the other walker attacks her. Gabriel saves her, and Rosita reveals that her arm is dislocated, and that she needs Gabriel's help to pop it back into place. Gabriel fixes Rosita's arm, but she insists on pressing on rather than resting, blaming herself for 
Coco
 being taken. Gabriel tells Rosita not to torture herself and reminds Rosita of her own words when Gabriel beats himself up: 
"quit bitching and move forward."
 As Rosita finally calms down, the two are surprised to hear a train whistle in the distance as there are no trains anymore.

At 
Junction 7
, Rosita and Gabriel join the Maggie and 
Carol
, explaining that they'd heard a train and followed it. Inside, 
Daryl
 lowers 
Nelson
 to the ground against a wall and checks his wound. Recognizing that it's mortal, Daryl tells Nelson that he's running out of time, and he asks the other man to do something good with the time that he has left and tell him where the train is going and what Designation 2 means as one of Daryl's friends was put on it with that designation. Coughing up blood and in pain, Nelson doesn't respond to Daryl's questions. Daryl tells Nelson that he was like him once: he joined the force because his family needed money which Daryl guesses is Nelson's motivation as well. Turning violent when Nelson continues to remain silent, Daryl yells that the Commonwealth has taken his kids from him and he wants them back, going so far as to kick the dying man. Entering, Carol tells Daryl that the train is going to be here soon, and Daryl suggests that they can hurry, drawing his knife and he offers Nelson the choice of dying quick or screaming.

Gabriel recognizes Nelson as a man from 
his church
 who was there every Sunday at the back pew closest to the door. Nelson would always come a little late and leave a little early, and it had seemed like Nelson had wanted to talk about something. Nelson asks if God forgives people like him, but Gabriel doesn't know, although he wishes that he did. Nelson admits that he's torn up all of the time with guilt and shame. Gabriel states that it's because Nelson's a coward, but that's alright as he's trying not to be. Gabriel knows that fear can drive people to do things that bring shame, but it can also push them into the light. Nelson is trying to do the right thing now which God sees and so does everyone else. Nelson tearfully wishes that he'd talked to Gabriel sooner which Gabriel wishes too. Nelson coughs up blood and Daryl nods to Gabriel who tells Nelson that 
"people remember the last thing that you do. The end of each story is very important. How do you want yours to end?"
 Nelson finally reveals that the Commonwealth punishes exiles by making them do hard labor and their friends are on railway duty. However, Nelson doesn't know where as he was only called out when they escaped, and they have to follow the train to find their friends. Addressing Daryl, Nelson states that he's only heard rumors about Designation 2 with the rumors stating that the Designation 2s are taken far away and they are never seen again. Daryl leaves and Gabriel agrees to pray with Nelson while he goes. Carol leaves at Gabriel's request and he sits down and prays with the dying man.

A few minutes later, Gabriel emerges carrying a bloody knife, having stabbed Nelson in the head to keep him from reanimating after he died. Daryl tells his friends that Connie's gone if the train pulls in, but Rosita worries that if the train sees them coming, they're going to radio ahead and the best way for them to get the kids is for the Commonwealth to not know they're coming. Daryl refuses to just leave Connie on the train and Carol tells him that she has an idea about how to do both.

The train arrives at the junction where 
Trooper 192
 emerges and puts down a walker before trying to move the junction switch which is stuck. 
Wilson
 attempts to let Outpost 22 know that they have a stuck junction switch and that it will take a few minutes to dislodge it, but he receives no response as Trooper 192 puts down another walker that emerges from the woods. Entering the cab, Maggie orders Wilson to put down the radio at gunpoint. Daryl and Carol sneak along the side of the train, putting down an approaching walker before ducking as an annoyed 
Jones
 asks his fellow soldier how hard it can be and Trooper 192 challenges him to come over so he can show Jones. Spotting a 
herd
 emerging from the woods and coming down the tracks, Jones orders 
Trooper 301
 and 
Trooper 263
 to cover the woods and the flank respectively.

Daryl and Carol crawl under the train as Jones jumps off the side, puts down a walker and goes to join Trooper 192 at the junction switch. In the woods, Trooper 301 finishes clearing the woods of walkers and calls in that the woods are cleared and she's heading back. Rosita and Gabriel ambush the soldier, disarming and killing her quietly so as not to draw notice from the other soldiers. Jones attempts to move the junction switch without success, and takes a closer look, realizing that someone had purposefully jammed it.

Alarmed, Jones orders everyone to get back there now, but Daryl opens fire before anyone can respond, killing Trooper 263. As Daryl and Carol take cover on the train, Jones and Trooper 192 each come down one side of the train, engaging in a gunfight with Daryl and Carol. Maggie emerges from the train cab and shoots Trooper 192 dead from behind. Daryl proceeds down the side, only to have Jones emerge with Connie as a hostage. Jones forces Daryl to disarm himself and, after Daryl admits that they had disabled the train's long-range antenna, Jones demands to know exactly what they did to it. While the soldier is distracted by Daryl, Connie breaks free and Jones takes off running through the train, chased by Daryl after he makes sure that Connie's alright. Jones takes one of the motorcycles being transported on the train and flees while Carol helps Connie to her feet. Leaving his friends to deal with the approaching herd, Daryl takes the other motorcycle and chases after Jones who crashes his motorcycle after going off-road with it in an attempt to avoid Daryl. Sliding his motorcycle under a fallen tree, Daryl hits Jones, sending him to the ground and knocking the man's helmet off. Daryl stabs Jones in the head, killing him.

Carol, Maggie, Gabriel and Rosita lead Wilson into the building where he refuses to help, stating that he's dead if he helps them. Wilson is shocked to see Nelson's dead body and Maggie warns the man that he's dead if he doesn't help them. Wilson explains that his family lives at a nearby outpost and if 
the Warden
 finds out that he helped them, Wilson will end up just like their friends. Rosita explains that the Commonwealth took their children and asks about the family that Wilson had mentioned before suggesting that Nelson had a family too. After a moment, Wilson tells them that there's a map in the train's engine room. Maggie and Carol take Wilson to get the map. Daryl returns and reunites with Connie, admitting in sign language that he was afraid that he wasn't going to see her again. Connie reassures Daryl that she's not going anywhere, causing Daryl to chuckle.

Suddenly, Daryl and Connie hear the sound of Wilson shouting at Maggie and Carol and rush over to see him holding a tool to his own throat while the two women try to talk him down. Wilson is terrified that the Warden will kill his wife and two sons if he helps them. Carol offers that if Wilson helps them, they will injure him, nothing serious, just enough to make it look like the engineer had barely gotten away from them and Wilson can tell the Warden that he escaped. However, Wilson believes that the Warden will know that he lied, torture him once he does and then kill Wilson's family. Despite Carol's efforts to talk him down, Wilson drives the tool through his neck, 
killing himself
 in order to spare his family from the Warden's vengeance.

Connie asks Daryl if they don't know which way to go which he confirms. Connie knows that Kelly is at Outpost 22 and scared and Connie can't lose her. Daryl promises Connie that they will find Kelly and Rosita suggests getting the train's long-range radio working again. Agreeing with the plan, the group heads back to the train to get the radio working again.

At night, posing as Trooper 301, Rosita radios in to Outpost 22, claiming that the train was overtaken and she's lost in the woods with the group still looking for her and she needs to get back to the site. Finally, a 
friendly soldier
 responds and Rosita identifies her location as Junction 7, stating that she's the last one left. The woman begins giving Rosita direction from Junction 7 to Outpost 22. The soldier informs Rosita that they don't have any spare units to send out her way for a pickup as they have a convoy coming in for colonial processing on Pamela's orders. 
"Word is that most of the processees used to live here before the Commonwealth claimed the territory and turned it into an outpost, back when it was still called 
Alexandria
."
 The soldier tells Rosita that the Warden will debrief her when she arrives and to shoot to kill if she has to engage any hostiles. The group is stunned by the revelation that Outpost 22 is actually Alexandria and Daryl informs Connie of this development. 
"Milton has underestimated us since day one. We are gonna get our kids, take back our home, and make it right. And Pamela is never gonna see it coming,"
 Maggie declares to her friends who are filled with new determination.



"
Faith
"


Outside of 
Alexandria
, 
Daryl
 reports that the situation is really bad and he's not sure that any of their friends are going to make it. 
Gabriel
 asks if they saw everyone and 
Carol
 clarifies that they only saw the adults and that there was no sign of 
Coco
, 
Hershel
 and the other kids. Both 
Maggie
 and Rosita are concerned by this with Rosita wanting to go in immediately. Daryl, acting as 
Connie
's sign language interpreter so that she understands their conversation, tells the others that they can't go in as there are too many guards and they'll never make it. Gabriel is furious that Pamela had turned their home into a prison after promising to give it back, but Maggie realizes that Pamela had never actually intended to give it back. Daryl comes up with the idea of going in through the 
sewers
 and Connie volunteers to go with him while Carol knows a way back into their old house, but she needs some backup just in case the guards blocked it. Maggie decides to go with Carol and Daryl orders them to head for the windmill where a sewer grate is. Rosita wants to go with them too, refusing to stay outside while Coco is inside, but Carol reminds Rosita that she and Gabriel are their best sharpshooters if it comes to that. Carol promises to keep in touch in case something goes wrong, and Rosita reluctantly agrees, although she will come in if takes more than a night. Daryl hands Gabriel his gun and the group separates to enact their plan.

After the successful 
prisoner rebellion
 and retaking of Alexandria, Rosita rushes in looking for her daughter who they can't find despite checking all of the other houses. However, Coco isn't with Hershel, and he doesn't know where she is.

In front of the windmill, 
Negan
 prepares to kill 
the Warden
 with a rock, but he's stopped by Rosita. Rosita demands to know where her daughter is, but the Warden refuses to answer. Seeing 
Sanborn
 reanimate, Rosita grabs him and holds the walker over the Warden's face, once again demanding to know where her daughter is. With a smile, the Warden sadistically tells Rosita that she will lose everything, and Rosita furiously shoves the zombified Sanborn into the Warden's face which Sanborn begins devouring, killing the Warden. Rosita walks away, leaving Sanborn to eat the Warden as her friends, the soldiers and former prisoners watch in shock and horror at the brutal death.



"
Family
"


In a reclaimed 
Alexandria
, 
the Coalition
 recover their various weapons from a large crate full of weapons confiscated by 
the Commonwealth
.

In front of the windmill, Rosita passes the corpses of 
Sanborn
 and 
the Warden
, grabbing an extra clip for her gun off of Sanborn's belt. 
Gabriel
 asks 
Tyler Davis
 if there's anything that he knows that can help them find the missing children and Tyler reveals that, when he was a soldier, kids without parents would end up at the 
Commonwealth Children's Home
. However, Tyler doesn't know where it is, so he goes to get the location from the captured 
Commonwealth soldiers
 at Gabriel's request. Rosita impatiently calls for the Coalition soldiers and freed prisoners to board the Commonwealth's transport bus. 
Princess
 asks 
Magna
 if anyone actually knows how to drive a train, but Magna reassures her that one of the prisoners apparently used to be an engineer before they board the bus, with 
Kelly
, 
Connie
, 
Adrienne
 and 
Dianne
 amongst those joining them.

As 
Maggie
 loads the back of the bus, 
Negan
 asks how she plans to take out 
Pamela Milton
. Negan gets that others have their own reasons for going back to the Commonwealth, but as far as he's concerned, none of them are safe as long as Pamela's still alive which he guesses that Maggie agrees with. Negan suggests that they can take out Pamela together without the help of the others, but Maggie closes the bus door and walks away, telling Negan that 
"we're not a we."
 In front of the bus, Maggie hugs 
Hershel
 and says a tearful goodbye to her son. 
Annie
 hugs Negan from behind and orders her husband to be careful. Negan states that he always is, and Annie tells Negan to come back in one piece while she holds down the fort in Alexandria and Negan promises to do so.

Nearby, 
Ezekiel
 says goodbye to 
Nabila
, 
Aliyah
 and 
Gracie
 while 
Daryl
 promises R.J. that they will be back soon and orders him to look after Judith. However, Judith tells Daryl and 
Carol
 that she's coming too over Daryl's objections. Judith reminds her friends that this isn't the future that Carl wanted and it's not what Rick and Michonne fought for, not yet at least. What they're doing could help everyone, maybe everybody everywhere, not just them. Judith wants to be a part of making what her family believed in real. Carol recognizes that while everyone else has been focused on the present for a long time, Judith has been thinking about the future which is a good thing and something that they could all do a little more of. Daryl agrees on the condition that Judith stays right with him, and he leaves R.J. in Nabila's care while they're gone.

On the railroad tracks, the Commonwealth's train smashes a walker to bits. Inside, observed by Daryl, Carol, Maggie and Judith, Rosita pours over a map of the Commonwealth with Gabriel, telling him that once they get inside, they will move the former prisoners into hiding and, as they hopefully get Mercer on their side to take out Pamela, she and Gabriel will go to get 
Coco
 back. Gabriel notices that they're going in through the lower ward and wonders why they're not going in through 
the Estates
 instead. Rosita points out that with more money, the Estates have more patrols, meaning that they don't stand out as much in the lower wards. They're going to use an access road that will allow them to hit the children's home from behind. Gabriel smiles at Rosita and promises her that they will get Coco back which is his faith in Rosita talking and Rosita is glad that Gabriel is with her.

Outside of the tunnel entrance, four Commonwealth soldiers patrol while the Coalition forces hide nearby. Negan tells the others that they are sitting ducks and Mercer isn't coming and they can't wait for him. Carol agrees that it's time for a new plan, but Princess is sure that Mercer is gonna show up. Daryl states that they're running out of time and Carol decides to head around and try to find another way to slip in. Maggie suggests that they could take the four guards, but Rosita warns her that if those guards go missing, the clock is going to start ticking on them. Judith draws the others attention as one of the guards notices something and starts heading their way. However, Lieutenant Rose calls in with orders from Mercer for the guards to report to the East Gate immediately to deal with the incoming herd. Lieutenant Rose confirms that that includes Tunnel H and he reassures the soldiers that the tunnel is locked, and they've got it covered on the other end. Complying with his orders, the guards move out. Breaking the lock on the door, the group makes their way into the tunnel.

The Coalition forces emerge from the tunnel in the seemingly-abandoned Union Station. Daryl quickly deduces that something isn't right, and he notices that the outer doors are all chained shut. Realizing that it's a trap, Daryl yells for everyone to get down as Pamela's private forces, situated on the station's balcony, open fire, killing Tyler and two former prisoners standing near him as everyone else dives for cover.

A gunfight erupts between Pamela's forces and the Coalition with Rosita desperately trying to get the doors open. One Alexandria resident crawls towards a hiding Connie, Kelly, Magna and Dianne, but he is shot in the head and killed by one of Pamela's men before he can reach them. As the gunfight continues, Pamela herself emerges and grabs a 
gun
 from one of her men who is killed by the Coalition. Pamela takes aim at Maggie, but Judith notices and shoves Maggie out of the way just in time, saving her life. Instead, Pamela accidentally shoots Judith, seriously wounding the young girl. Daryl desperately attends to Judith as Pamela watches in horror and the others increase their fire, killing a few more of Pamela's men. Yelling that 
"you did this,"
 Pamela retreats to her office. Looking for a way out, Daryl spots a 
fire extinguisher
 near Ezekiel and signals him to throw it. Grabbing Rick's Colt Python from Judith, Daryl shoots the fire extinguisher, creating a smokescreen.

In Union Square, 
Yumiko
 and 
Max
 observe the heavily guarded doors to Union Station from across the street. Hearing twigs snapping, Yumiko spots a hooded 
Eugene
 sneaking around a train car, armed with 
Brooks
' rifle and she tells Max that they are going to go around. Inside, under cover of the smokescreen, Daryl and the others manage to break the chains sealing a side door. As a trooper approaches the doors, Eugene ambushes him and knocks the man out with the butt of his rifle. Magna finally breaks through the doors, and everyone is reunited with Eugene, Yumiko and Max before quickly making their escape.

The Coalition races through the streets towards the 
hospital
 with Daryl carrying the unconscious Judith. Commonwealth vehicles drive up and block their path in multiple directions, forcing them to fall back. Carol realizes that the soldiers aren't following them as they begin to erect barricades in the streets. Loudly yelling and firing their guns in the air, Commonwealth soldiers lead the herd in their direction before closing the barricades, penning the herd and the Coalition in. Spotting a walker climbing over something, a shocked Negan asks 
"what the fuck?"
 As walkers close in from multiple directions, 
Luke
 and 
Jules
 emerge from the herd, causing Kelly to nearly shoot them before Connie stops her sister. Fleeing down a side street, Carol spots an alley near part of the herd and everyone attacks the walkers, clearing a path for Daryl to flee down the alley towards the hospital with Judith. Waking up for a moment, Judith calls out 
"daddy?"
 and witnesses her friends and loved ones struggling to hold back the herd before passing out again.



"
Rest in Peace
"


In the streets, 
the Coalition
 desperately fights off the 
herd
 as they try to escape from the walkers swarming around them, those armed with guns shooting the undead while the rest stab at them with knives, including 
Max
. However, 
Jules
 misses the head of one walker, instead stabbing it in the shoulder. The walker bites Jules in the arm and 
Luke
 rushes to his girlfriend's aid, stabbing the walker in the head and yelling for help as he supports Jules. However, walkers swarm the couple from behind with one tackling Luke to the ground and biting him in the leg as Jules is dragged down and devoured. Seeing Luke's predicament, 
Connie
 shoots the walker in the head and Luke is dragged to safety by 
Kelly
 and 
Yumiko
, yelling in desperation for his girlfriend as Jules is devoured, beyond the ability of any of her friends to try to save her. Shooting at a smaller group of walkers coming down an alleyway, 
Carol
 orders her friends to follow her down it and everyone flees as the herd overruns the streets.

At the 
Commonwealth Children's Home
, walkers devour a couple of corpses while two more corpses lie in the hallways. Rosita, 
Eugene
 and 
Gabriel
 enter and Rosita is frantic for her daughter's safety upon seeing the corpses. Hearing the sound of crying, Rosita runs off while Eugene and Gabriel use the bayonets on their 
AR-15s
 to dispatch the walkers eating the bodies. In the nursery, 
Coco
, 
Mariam
 and 
Adam
 are protected by an upside-down crib that has been placed over them while three walkers try to get at the children. Rushing in, Rosita is grabbed by a walker that surprises her, but she manages to break free and put all three down, saving the children. Rosita embraces her daughter as Eugene and Gabriel rush in, relieved to find the children alright and Eugene soothes Mariam while Gabriel joins Rosita with Coco. Ezekiel radios in that they've got Mercer and asks for any updates on the kids. Gabriel reports the good news and Ezekiel promises to see them at the hospital.

At 
the hospital
, as Daryl tries to wake 
Judith Grimes
 up, Rosita calls in with the news that her group is in the alley behind the hospital, but they wrecked their ambulance going through the herd which is now surrounded by walkers. Rosita, Eugene and Gabriel burst out of the ambulance, each carrying a child in slings, but find themselves surrounded on all sides by walkers. Fighting back-to-back and saving each other when they fall into danger from walkers, Rosita orders everyone up a nearby drainage pipe to a window. However, while Eugene and Gabriel make it safely, but the walkers drag Rosita backwards and she falls into the herd with Coco. As Eugene and Gabriel mourn for her apparent loss, Rosita suddenly breaks free, slicing a walker's head in two, getting back to her feet and taking out several walkers as they all try to swarm her. Rosita manages to climb on top of the ambulance, followed by two climbers, and successfully makes a jump to the drainpipe where she climbs into the window.

At night, outside of a loading dock, Mercer observes a crowd of desperate Commonwealth residents demanding to be let into the Estates. Mercer reassures Maggie that they will be able to move soon while Aaron tells Ezekiel that he saw people on the higher floors and rooftops begging for help, but he wanted to make sure that Lydia was safe first. Ezekiel reassures his friend that he did the right thing. Hearing screams in the distance, both men are determined to do more, but they need to take care of Judith first. Lieutenant 
Rose
 arrives in another truck and reports to Mercer that they're all set: everyone is in the back and there's no one to check. The doctors have set up a safe house, but they have to hurry. Mercer calls for everyone to go, stating that they need to get Judith to 
Tomi
. Everyone boards the truck with Princess, Max and Dianne pushing Judith's stretcher.

At the safe house in the Estates, Eugene sits next to a sleeping Max, but he gets up after noticing how upset Rosita looks as she plays with Coco nearby. Eugene offers to take Coco off of Rosita's hands for a bit so that she can get some rest, but Rosita kindly refuses his offer. Eugene brings up plans for the future, such as teaching Coco how to swim at 
Oceanside
, but Rosita doesn't respond. Eugene begins to go into a scientific explanation as to why teaching Coco to swim as an infant is a good idea, but Rosita continues to fail to respond to him. Rosita wipes away a tear as Eugene asks her if she can't wait for summer and Eugene realizes that something is horribly wrong. Rosita shows Eugene a bite mark on the back of her left shoulder, having been bitten by a walker when she fell. Eugene breaks down in tears, knowing that there's nothing that can be done to save Rosita. Accepting of her fate, Rosita orders Eugene to pull himself together as she doesn't want the others to know yet and she's still there and Eugene will be fine. Eugene admits that he loves Rosita deeply, a sentiment which she returns. Working to compose himself, Eugene returns to Max where he hides the truth, complying with Rosita's wishes.

Suddenly, there's shouts outside and two gunshots. Looking outside, Mercer sees a man trying to climb the wall, only to be shot by Commonwealth soldiers on Pamela's orders. Mercer tells the others that the soldiers are shooting anyone that climbs the gates and grabs a gun, unwilling to just stand by as people are dying. Mercer informs the Coalition members that the truck is gassed up with enough reserves in the rear to get them home. Mercer and his men can sneak them out the back as Mercer believes that this isn't their fight or their people. 
"Yes, they are. And so are you,"
 states Ezekiel. Addressing the others, Ezekiel tells them that 
"you may not think this place is worth saving, and I get that, given how they treated us. But it's worth it to me. The people are worth it, and I'm not gonna allow them to fall without a fight. Not today. I'm with you. Who else?"
 Aaron immediately agrees, stating that they can do more than just save themselves and they need to. Following Ezekiel's lead, everyone agrees to fight to save the Commonwealth.

At the gates of the Estates, the crowd desperately begs Pamela to be let in, amongst them 
Mr. Martens
, 
Mrs. Martens
 and 
Mei
. On a balcony, Maggie lines up her shot on Pamela, but Negan tells her to hold on as Mercer and his loyalist forces move in, ordering Colonel 
Vickers
 and her men to lower their weapons. Pamela orders Vickers to arrest them, but the Coalition forces join Mercer's troops from another angle, creating a standoff. Pamela accuses Mercer of being a traitor, but Mercer states that she's the true traitor and lists Pamela's crimes: disappearing hundreds of citizens, leading the dead to their doorstep, shooting a child and now leaving thousands to die.

The banging on the gates grows more frantic as the herd begins to approach the Estates, meaning that the people will die if they're not let inside. Gabriel moves towards the gates despite Vickers orders to stop. Gabriel announces that they're opening the gate and letting everyone inside, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him. Vickers threatens to shoot him, but Carol warns her that they will fire back if she does. Pamela orders her men to shoot Gabriel as he reaches the gates and one of them points a gun at his head. Suddenly, Daryl yells for them to stop. 
"What the hell you doing?"
 Daryl demands. 
"We all deserve better than this. You built this place to be like the old world. That was the fuckin' problem."
 Pamela states that if she opens the gates, the dead will get in too, not just the living. Daryl tells her that if she doesn't, Pamela will lose everything anyway. 
"We got one enemy. We ain't the walking dead."


Realizing that Daryl is right, Vickers orders everyone to lower their weapons and give Gabriel the key to the gates. Everyone stands down and Vickers defers to Mercer's command who places Pamela under arrest for high crimes against the people of the Commonwealth. As everyone rushes to help let the people in, Maggie informs Negan that Pamela is getting arrested and Negan tells her that prison is a fate worse than death for someone like Pamela, causing Maggie to relent in shooting her.

The crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in 
Alexandria
 and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified 
Lance Hornsby
, Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of 
suicide
. Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rife, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back.

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates.

Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

In Alexandria, everyone enjoys a celebration and feast, joined by Mercer, Max and Tomi. Judith gives 
Dog
 some of her food and Yumiko raises a toast to Luke. Looking out the window, Daryl sees Negan walking away and the two men exchange a smile and a nod, parting on good terms. Yumiko turns to Magna, telling her 
"same"
 and Magna kisses her, the two women resuming their romantic relationship. Sitting down, Rosita smiles as she watches the celebration before becoming somber. Noticing Rosita's somber mood, Gabriel joins her, and Rosita tells him that she just wants to remember this perfect moment. In a whisper, Rosita reveals her bite and impending death to Gabriel. Noticing Rosita's behavior and crying, Judith realizes that something's wrong with her and becomes upset, apparently deducing the truth.

Weak and near death, Rosita is led to bed by Maggie and Carol where Coco is laying. With everyone now aware that Rosita's dying, a tearful Maggie gives her a hug and kiss goodbye and Carol hugs her before the two women leave. As Daryl watches from the doorway, a barely composed Gabriel performs Last Rites over Rosita. Rosita kisses Coco for a final time and Gabriel promises that they will see her again someday. Gabriel carries Coco out as Eugene takes a seat next to Rosita's bed. Eugene tearfully tells Rosita that he wouldn't be the man that he is today if he hadn't met her. Taking Eugene's hand, Rosita tells him that she's glad that it was him in the end who will be there to make sure that she won't reanimate after she's gone. Rosita peacefully passes away with her oldest living friend at her side. 

A year later, Rosita's name is on a memorial plaque for those lost in the walker invasion with her name beside those of Luke, Jules and 
Marissa Berot
. Eugene lays down flowers for his lost friends before pressing a kiss to Rosita's name.

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Jordana Barraza
.
[3]


Rosita was described as "Late 20s. She is a beautiful and tough Hispanic woman shamed about her past."


Upon a Q&A when discussing her character 
Christian Serratos
 stated, "She's remarkably brave. What I love about her is that she's definitely a capable woman and is capable of taking care of herself. If she was alone in the apocalypse, she would manage very well and would be just fine. We had a city-wide blackout and I panicked and ran to 
Steven Yeun
's apartment for help, so she has a leg up on me when it comes to bravery."


She learned her nursing skills after the apocalypse from former members of her group.

On 
Talking Dead
, Christian Serratos says that this was also where Rosita learned her outdoor survivalist skills.


In a deleted scene from "
Remember
", she meets with 
Pete Anderson
, the 
town
's surgeon, and is assigned to work as his medical assistant.


It was revealed on the Talking Dead episode of "
Not Tomorrow Yet
" by 
Ross Marquand
 that Rosita has past military experience, and it was this experience alongside 
Abraham
's that helped the group execute their raid of the 
Savior outpost
 in the episode.


In "
Hearts Still Beating
", Rosita was given a permanent scar on her right cheek from 
Arat
, a 
Savior
, when she cut into her skin.

This most likely a nod to 
Andrea
 from the 
Comic Series
.


Aside from this, Rosita is the second main character to have a scar on her cheek. The first being 
Beth Greene
 and the third being 
Lance Hornsby
.


Before Rick's departure from the show, Rosita was the only character to appear in more episodes in a single season than Rick.


Rosita is the female character with the most romantic relationships in the 
series
 compared to anyone else, with a total of seven.


Rosita is one of the fourteen characters in the 
TV universe
 to be pregnant during the events of the apocalypse. The others being 
Lori Grimes
, 
Maggie Rhee
, 
Eileen
, 
Ava
, 
Vida
, an unnamed 
Sanctuary Worker
, an unnamed 
Kingdommer
, 
Jane Carroll
, 
Michonne Grimes
, 
Nabila
, 
Grace Mukherjee
, 
Rachel
, and 
Aiden
.


Rosita is the eighth main character to outlive her comic book 
counterpart
, with the first being 
Shane Walsh
, the second being 
Carol Peletier
, the third being 
Tyreese Williams
, the fourth being 
Beth Greene
, the fifth being 
Judith Grimes
, the sixth being 
Morgan Jones
, the seventh being 
Abraham Ford
, the ninth being 
Ezekiel Sutton
, the tenth being 
Alpha
 and the eleventh being 
Gabriel Stokes
.


She is one of thirteen characters known to speak Spanish in the series.

The others are 
Dante
, 
Morales
, 
Juanita Sanchez
, 
Gabriel Stokes
, 
Judith Grimes
, 
Miguel
, 
Felipe
, 
Guillermo
, 
Abuela
, 
Vazquez
, and the 
Mexi
can
 
Family
.


Rosita is the sixth most appearing character on the series, having appeared in 94 episodes.


Rosita's current signature weapon is a modern recreation of the 
Macuahuitl
 that she is wielding since 
Season 10
.

The Macuahuitl is a long wooden paddle with serrated blades emended along its sides, this close combat weapon was widely distributed to soldiers throughout ancient Mesoamerica.


This weapon is likely a tribute to Rosita's heritage.


Rosita, along with 
Magna
, 
Alden
, and 
Connie
, are the only surviving main characters of Season 10 to not appear in any of the six bonus episodes at the end of the season.


Rosita is one of fifteen characters in the 
TV universe
 to have dropped an uncensored f-bomb.

The others are 
Nick Clark
, 
Madison Clark
, 
Hope Bennett
, 
Daryl Dixon
, 
Jason Riley
, 
Winokur
, 
Alvarez
, 
Joe
, 
Evie
, 
Sandra
, 
Erika
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Juanita Sanchez
, and 
Michael Mercer
.


She said it three times in 
Season 11
.

The first time was by accident when 
Cassady McClincy
 accidentally hit Christian Serratos' elbow in "
No Other Way
", and is not in the subtitles.


Rosita is the seventh main character to be bitten by a walker, the first being 
Hershel Greene
, the second being 
Andrea Harrison
, the third being 
Bob Stookey
, the fourth being 
Tyreese Williams
, the fifth being 
Deanna Monroe
, and the sixth being 
Carl Grimes
.

Her and Bob are the only main characters to die directly from the infection, as Hershel survived his bite, Andrea and Carl shot themselves before they could succumb, Tyreese died from the amputation blood loss, and Deanna allowed herself to be devoured by more walkers.


Rosita is the fourth main character to be killed in a season finale, the first being 
Andrea Harrison
, the second being 
Abraham Ford
, and the third being 
Sasha Williams
.

She is the last main character to die, the last named character to die, and the final living character to die in 
The Walking Dead
.


She is also the last named character to die as a result of walkers; having died from a walker bite on her shoulder.


She is the longest-running character to die in 
The Walking Dead
, having a lifespan that consists of 133 of the 177 total episodes, which makes up for 75% of the series.


With Rosita's death, a total of 30 main characters died in 
The Walking Dead
.


Rosita is the only person that Eugene is known to have put down before reanimation.


Rosita is the last named character to be killed by 
Eugene Porter
 in the series, as he put her down before reanimation.
