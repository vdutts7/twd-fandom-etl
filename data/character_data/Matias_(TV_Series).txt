Overview
[
]


Matias proves to be unable to handle the stress of the apocalypse. In the basement, he begins to panic and yells loudly for someone to help them, which most likely would've attracted walkers. Matias' panicking leads to his own demise when 
Alpha
 kills him due to putting everyone at risk. However, due to no one knowing that everyone is infected, Matias reanimates and ends up killing everyone in the basement.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Mid-Atlantic, United States
[
]


Nothing is known about Matias' life prior to or as the outbreak began. It's possible he lived in the Mid-Atlantic states within the United States.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Season 9
[
]


Baltimore, Maryland
[
]


Sometime in the early days of the outbreak, Matias took shelter in an abandoned warehouse within or near Baltimore.



"
Omega
"
[
]


Matias is among the survivors inside a shelter, alongside 
Dee
 and her family. After 23 days of surviving the initial outbreak, Matias plans with other survivors about sending a group to leave the shelter to look for supplies. Dee is eager to leave with the group, but her 
husband
 maintains that they stay put.

After 43 days, the undead begin to overrun the outside of the building. Matias starts to have a panic attack and wants to leave the basement. Dee, knowing noise could draw them in, suffocates Matias to death by pressing down on his windpipe with her forearm, believing that he was too weak to survive this world.

Later that night, unknown to the group about the virus infecting the living, a reanimated Matias begins to attack 
Lydia
 and the sleeping survivors. A bearded man intervenes after waking up to Lydia's screams, but the undead Matias bites the man's neck. Another survivor tries to throw Matias off the bearded man but instead is struck in the back with an axe by a woman, believing he was a zombie. Amidst the chaos, Matias continues to attack the survivors until everyone is dead.

It is unknown if Matias was ever put down.
