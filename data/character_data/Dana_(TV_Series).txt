“


What'd you say your speciality was? (...) So you have never performed surgery? Amputations? Are you even strong enough to hold someone down who hasn't been anesitized? Can you shoot a gun? More importantly can you shoot a gun while holding someone down? (...) Really? Cuz it sounds to me like you don't know enough of anything and in my experience people who don't know enough are more dangerous than people who don't know 
shit

Overview
[
]


Dana comes off as a rather condescending and strict person. As the doctor of the 
Kingdom
, she is shown to be intelligent and is quite experienced. However, to those who she seems as not ready or uneducated, she often gives a hard time, saying 
"In my experience people who don't know enough are more dangerous than people who don't know shit."
 She initially gives 
Siddiq
 a hard time, hitting him with my questions about what he knows believing him to be not ready. However, Siddiq stands up for himself and shows that he is capable. Dana is admires this, stating that she likes Siddiq before sending him back to work.



Pre-Apocalypse

Location Unknown
[

Nothing is known about Dana's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she was a surgeon.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Dana joined a community called 
the Kingdom
 where she became the main doctor.



Season 8
[

"
Do Not Send Us Astray
"
[
]


Following her evacuation to 
the Hilltop
 with the other Kingdommers, Dana has taken up the role of the community doctor. While the militia prepares for the upcoming battle against 
the Saviors
, she is busy gathering supplies at the infirmary when 
Siddiq
 arrives with blankets and offers to help. Dana gives Siddiq a hard time until he snaps and demands that she start cooperating with him instead of fighting. Taken back in admiration, she tells Siddiq that she approves of him and sends him to work.

That night, at around 4:00 am, Dana heads towards the medical trailer until she finds the door wide open with a 
pool of blood
 at the doorway. Before she can react, she is bitten on the neck and killed by a zombified 
Tobin
. A short time later, a reanimated Dana is along the zombified residents and refugees to attack the people sleeping inside the Barrington House. During the attack, Dana is put down with a knife to the face by 
Daryl
. The next morning, she is buried in the graveyard with the other casualties.

Trivia
[
]


While Dana was not introduced until Season 8, Episode 13 "
Do Not Send Us Astray
", she was referenced multiple times by other characters in Season 7 and Season 8.

In "
The Well
", Morgan made a reference to Dana while speaking with a recovering Carol in her hospital bed.


In "
Rock in the Road
", Morgan made a reference to Dana when mentioning to Rick that the "doctors" took care of Carol.


In "
Mercy
", Ezekiel suggested to Maggie that she visit their doctor at the Kingdom, quoting her as a “woman of talent”.


In "
JSS
", 
Denise
 the Alexandrian doctor is mistakenly referred to as "Dana" by Tara.


She is the third known character (after 
Tobin
 and 
Kurt
) to have a time of death, in her case between 3:57 AM and 3:58 AM.


Dana is the second doctor to die during 
All Out War
, the first being 
Harlan Carson
.

She is also the fourth doctor killed by the 
Saviors
, the first is 
Denise Cloyd
, then 
Emmett Carson
, next Harlan Carson, and Dana being the last (though Denise, Emmett, and Harlan are directly caused and Dana is indirectly caused).


Technically, Dana is the last named 
Kingdom
 resident to die on-screen, since both 
Henry
's alive and zombified deaths were off-screen.
