Mrs. Martens and her husband are among the dozens of people protesting in Union Square. She demands justice for the death of her daughter and that Sebastian be held accountable. As Governor Milton attempts to leave the train station, Mrs. Martens and her husband and several people make their way into the station and confront her as she walks down the stairs. While she and the rest of the protestors are kicked back outside, she remains at the demonstration until everyone is ordered home by 
Henderson
 due to an oncoming herd.

That night, Mrs. Martens attends a memorial for her daughter at Union Square alongside her husband and several other city residents. Henderson and a group of soldiers once again order the residents home for violating curfew and that the herd is still a threat outside the walls. When most people refuse to leave, tear gas is deployed, sending everyone scrambling.
