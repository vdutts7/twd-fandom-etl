Overview
[
]


Donnie is an aggressive, volatile, fuming, hostile, and misogynistic man. He grows a deep hatred for 
Carol
 who shot him in the arm and wants revenge against her. Eventually, Donnie explodes and goes into a blind rage. Donnie's aggression even causes him to attack his own allies, shown when he hits 
Paula
. He attacks 
Maggie
 and brutally beats Carol before being knocked unconscious by Paula. Donnie's cruel nature even makes him disliked by his fellow 
Saviors
 who are shown to annoyed with his behavior.

Location Unknown

Nothing is known about Donnie's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Washington, D.C.
[
]


At some point in the apocalypse, Donnie somehow came into contact with a group named "the Saviors" which he subsequently joined, during where he developed a sexual relationship with his fellow survivor 
Paula
. 

Donnie aided his group in terrorizing other survivors and communities around the area into subjugating to Negan's will, where their victims would be forced to give half their supplies in exchange for not being murdered.



Season 6
[

"
The Same Boat
"
[
]


Having escaped the Satellite outpost with 
Molly
, 
Michelle
, and 
Paula
, Donnie sneaks up behind 
Maggie
 in the woods but is shot in the arm by 
Carol
. Before he can be further harmed, his fellow Saviors capture Carol and Maggie. The next morning, an injured Donnie has his arm temporarily treated and ventures to the safe house to await reinforcements. However, he remains in a sour mood about his injury, threatening Carol and striking Paula after she rejects to make a trade with Rick and his group. 

While trying to kill Carol, Donnie is knocked out by Paula and eventually dies from his infected gunshot wound. When Maggie removes his bandage to let him bleed out, she realizes that he had already died and is in the process of turning. He is tethered to a pipe to be used as a trap and shortly after reanimates. When Molly enters the room to check on him, the zombified Donnie bites her, causing her to kill him immediately.

Trivia
[
]


Donnie is one of four characters to be monoplegic, as he lost the ability to move his left arm after he was shot.

The other characters with this distinction are 
Bob Lamson
, who is able to still move his left foot moments after being hit by a car, 
Phil
, who is able to move his right leg despite having a beam going through his lower spine, and 
Melvin
, who is able to move his right leg after the explosion.


Donnie is the only monoplegic victim to have lost the ability to use an arm instead of a leg.


Donnie is the one of only plegic victim who's paralysis is not caused by a spinal cord injury, instead his being caused by nerve damage from a gunshot wound.
