“


She was dying. It should’ve been me on that table. I wouldn’t have mattered to anybody. She was a loss to the world.  Hell, she ran this place. I just worked here. In our field she was an Einstein. Me? I’m just… Edwin Jenner. She could’ve done something about this. Not me.

Edwin Jenner

Pre-Apocalypse

Atlanta
, 
Center for Disease Control
[
]


Candace was born in 1976. She worked alongside her husband 
Edwin Jenner
 and the computer-AI 
Vi
 at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. She was described by her husband as being an exceptional genius and leading mind in their field, to whom his own skills as a scientist could not match.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


During the onset of the outbreak, Candace, along with her husband and colleagues in the CDC attempted to find a cure to reverse the outbreak, however, the situation only worsened despite their efforts and many of her colleagues either fled the CDC to be with their families or committed suicide. 

At some point, Candace was bitten and infected and resigned to her fate, decided to donate her failing body to be studied in the hopes of developing a cure. Before her death, Candace begged her husband to keep trying to find a cure for as long as he could and Jenner reluctantly agreed at his wife's request. Candace then died and Jenner put her down. He recorded her death and reanimation time, timing it exactly as two hours, one minute, seven seconds.

Edwin was seen in a Bio-safety Level 4 lab working on brain matter samples from Candace in an effort to finding a cure. He accidentally knocked over a vial causing the chemicals to mix. This made the air toxic, Vi informed that the lab needed to be sterilized since the air has been compromised. Once Edwin left the lab, Vi set the lab on fire and burned away all remaining samples of Candace.



"
TS-19
"


Edwin brought the group to the control room to explain what he knew and talks about the CDC, how he was the last one and the rest of the doctors and staff were gone. He then showed his findings about the infection and how it changed the brain of those bitten. He showed Candace's MRI scans to the group and explained what he knew about the disease. He revealed that his wife was named Test-Subject 19 and talked about the promise he made to her about finding a cure. He also mentioned that her body reanimated in two hours, one minute, and seven seconds and then a few minutes later, he shot her in the head.

Two hours after her death, she reanimated and once it was clear that her brain couldn't provide any more useful information in an active state, Edwin shot her in the head. He used her body to gain brain tissue samples to aid in the development of a cure.

Trivia
[
]


Candace appears in "TS-19" as an archived MRI footage and in a photograph on Edwin Jenner's desk. However, she, like 
Private Gaines
, actually appears in a deleted scene for the episode of "
TS-19
".


Candace is the only character in the 
TV Series
 whose fate is shown on a tape.


She is one of three characters in which it is known how long it took for them to turn, in her case 2 hours, 1 minute, 7 seconds.

The other known characters are 
Tobin
 at 1 hour and 13 minutes, and 
Barca
 at 7 hours and 48 minutes.


Originally, Candace was meant to appear in the "
Pilot
" of 
Fear the Walking Dead
, but her scene was cut. 
[1]


In 
World Beyond
, Candice is mentioned in the mid-credit scene of "
The Last Light
" by her 
husband
.
