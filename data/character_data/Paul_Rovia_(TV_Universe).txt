Overview


Jesus is described as smart, friendly, and charming with a puckish sense of humor. It is stated that he can be a thief, but he'll only steal half of what someone has, and only if he knows it won't cause any permanent damage. He's generally shown to be a beloved guy and pretty much makes friends with everyone he meets.

Jesus won't hesitate to kill in order to protect his friends, but he seems to show mercy to innocent people and the surrendering. This can be seen in "
The Damned
", when he prevents 
Tara Chambler
 from killing 
Dean
, a 
Savior
 who claims to be a worker from the Sanctuary forced from his family. Later, he also prevents 
Morgan Jones
 from killing 
Jared
 stating that this isn't what they do. Jesus' ultimate plan is to let 
the Saviors
 live peacefully among the Hilltopers, after the war against 
Negan
 is over, believing they can redeem themselves.

In "
Wrath
", Jesus' plan seems to become a reality after 
Rick Grimes
 has a change of heart because of his 
son
's death and he decides to let the Saviors live in order for all the communities to live in peace and rebuild civilization. Also, 
Maggie Rhee
 later agrees that Jesus was right about not killing all the Saviors, believing there are some people that can indeed change; an example being 
Alden
 and his group even though they were members of the Saviors. However, Maggie strongly disagrees with Rick and 
Michonne Hawthorne
's decision to let Negan live and she, as well as Jesus and 
Daryl Dixon
, decide to show Rick that he's wrong.

In "
Season 9
", Jesus is now one of Maggie's closest friends and followers, always offering her advice. Six years after Rick's presumed death, Maggie leaves Hilltop with her son, leaving the leadership to Jesus. However, Jesus still feels that he isn't fit to be the leader and feels more comfortable exploring in the wilderness. Despite Alexandria being isolationist from the other communities, Jesus sees Aaron and talks with him so they don't lose full communication, showing that Jesus wants everyone to be united like they once were.

When the group is surrounded by several walkers on a foggy graveyard, Jesus decides to stay behind and to give the group some time to escape, however, this heroic action would unknowingly cost him his own life. In the end, Jesus died a brave man willing to give his life to save his friends and despite not accepting it, he found his own place in the new world as a figure one could follow.



Pre-Apocalypse


Virginia


Jesus grew up as an orphan in a group home in 
Virginia
. For most of his life, Jesus grew up around a large number of children, which he became accustomed to, although he generally struggled in forming connections with other people. Openly gay, he still found difficulty in relationships with boyfriends.
[2]


As an adult, he managed to gather several friends. From them, he received the nickname "Jesus" due to his stereotypical Western resemblance to the religious figure 
Jesus Christ
. Jesus trained in martial arts and became a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and learned the art of pick-pocketing and escapology.
[3]




Post-Apocalypse


At some point after the outbreak, Jesus journeyed to a safe zone named the Hilltop Colony upon where he settled into and thus became effectively integrated with the fellow residents of the community. Jesus quickly befriended the community leader 
Gregory
 and the two developed a working partnership and thus he proved to become an invaluable member of the farming community.

Benefitting from his abilities and experience, Jesus was appointed as the community's recruiter where he was assigned to scavenge for supplies as well as to locate other communities and settlements to trade with in order to establish a network to help contribute towards the Hilltop Colony in order to help maintain and prosper throughout the apocalypse.

Jesus was present at the time of the arrival of a notorious group named "
The Saviors
" who operated on behalf of a man named 
Negan
. During a meeting conducted by Gregory alongside a dispatched squadron, The Saviors demanded half of the Hilltop Colony's supplies in exchange for leaving the farming community unscathed. Though initially reluctant to agree, they eventually complied after witnessing the public execution of 
Rory
, a 16-year-old resident of the community.

Following this event, the Hilltop Colony entered into a period of dread and subjugation and thus were forced to comply under Negan's corrupt rule, as a result of their limited resources and manpower they were unable to rebel against their save oppressors. Throughout the following months, Jesus alongside the other residents begrudgingly worked to gather supplies in their desperate struggle in order to compensate with Negan's demands.

"
The Next World
"


Jesus is first seen running into 
Rick Grimes
 and 
Daryl Dixon
 where he is held at gunpoint by the pair. He tells them that he was being chased by walkers and they are following him closely. After a brief and tense introduction, gunshots can be heard, prompting Rick and Daryl to investigate. However, upon finding out that that it was just firecrackers, they soon realized it was a ruse that allowed Jesus to steal Rick's keys and make off with the truck of supplies.

After a long run, Rick and Daryl are able to track him down, bind him, and win back the food truck. As they approach a small farm, they realize that Jesus is on top of the truck. When Rick slams the brake pedal, he falls onto the front of the truck. He then tries to escape as Daryl chases after him, Rick killing the nearby walkers. As Jesus and Daryl scuffle inside the truck, a walker emerges behind Daryl. He tells Daryl to duck, which he does, and shoots the walker, saving him. As they continue to fight for the food truck, Jesus accidentally releases the emergency brake and the vehicle rolls into a nearby pond and sinks. As the truck is falling into the pond, the door hits Jesus and knocks him out cold. Daryl suggests that they leave him behind. But Rick points out that Jesus saved Daryl and he begrudgingly agrees.

Later on, he is sitting in the back, tied up as Daryl guards him and Rick drives them back to 
Alexandria
.

They carry him to the infirmary and let Denise check him out. He is later brought to the townhouse basement where Rick and Daryl leave water and a note next to his unconscious body. When Rick and 
Michonne
 are lying naked in their bed, Jesus walks into the room and tells Rick to wake up. As Rick and Michonne leap up and grab their weapons, Jesus says, "We should talk."



"
Knots Untie
"


In Rick's house, Jesus waits for Michonne and Rick to get dressed. Rick's son 
Carl
 discovers Jesus and points a gun at his head as the others arrive. Michonne and Rick emerge from the bedroom and assures everyone that Jesus just wants to talk.

Jesus tells Rick's group that he's part of a community that raises livestock and crops, and his job is to search for other settlements with whom to open trade. He offers to take them to his community, the 
Hilltop
, to prove he is telling the truth. Rick, Daryl, Michonne, 
Glenn Rhee
, 
Maggie Greene
, and 
Abraham Ford
 board the community's RV with Jesus.

Rick slows the motor home as they approach an overturned car. Jesus recognizes it as belonging to the Hilltop and desperately begins searching the wreckage for his people. The group finds four of Jesus' people, one of whom is injured. 
Freddie
, one of the newcomers, tells Jesus that he saw a vision of his dead wife when he thought he was going to die. The motor home gets stuck in mud, forcing the group to disembark. Jesus points ahead to a massive wall. "That's the Hilltop," he says.

Jesus leads the group to the main gate, where spear-wielding guards order Rick's group to disarm. Jesus tells Rick they can keep their guns and confides that his community ran out of ammo months ago. The gates open, revealing a large manor house and a farming community inside. Jesus explains that the house was once a living history museum. Jesus takes the group inside, where they meet 
Gregory
, the community's leader. Gregory orders Rick's group to clean up before meeting with him. Jesus assures Rick and Daryl that he can convince Gregory to make a fair trade. They hear a commotion outside. "They're back," a resident tells Gregory.

When 
Ethan
 comes back from a mission to 
Negan
, Ethan stabs Gregory in the gut and Rick kills him. Jesus calms astonished residents by pointing out that Ethan initiated the bloodshed. In the library, Jesus explains that Negan is the head of a group called the 
Saviors
, who agreed not to attack the Hilltop in exchange for half of their supplies. Rick's group offers to rescue Craig and wipe out the Saviors in exchange for food, medicine and supplies. Jesus agrees to take the offer to Gregory. Later, Jesus reports that Gregory wants to discuss the offer with Maggie.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"


Jesus is first seen in the church in Alexandria as Rick tries to convince the Alexandrians that they need to fight against the Saviors.

On the road, Jesus and Andy are trying to decide which of three decapitated walker heads that they have collected, as part of their plan to fool the Saviors, looks most like Gregory. Jesus picks a head but remarks that Gregory's nose is slightly different. Rick grabs the head and pummels the nose as Jesus and Andy watch in shock, figuring Andy can tell the Saviors that he broke Gregory's nose in a struggle. Andy remarks to Rick that "the Saviors, they're scary, but those pricks got nothing on you."

Later, Jesus, 
Gabriel Stokes
, 
Tara Chambler
, Andy, and Craig wait outside in a car. Jesus listens as Tara confesses to Gabriel that she told her girlfriend 
Denise Cloyd
 that she loved her, but only did so to hide her misgivings about their mission to kill the Saviors. Jesus asks Tara if she does love Denise, to which Tara says she does. "So you know what you're fighting for," Jesus says.

When the alarm inside the Saviors base is activated, Tara says that they need to get back to the Hilltop so that the deal is still on. Jesus declines and sends Andy and Craig back to the Hilltop alone, staying behind to help the others. Once inside, he shoots a weakened Savior, saving Glenn and 
Heath
. “So this is the next world,” Jesus comments.

Go Getters

Jesus approaches to Maggie and Sasha to where Glenn and Abraham are buried and places flowers on the graves. Gregory arrives and demands to know why Maggie's people didn't wipe out all the Saviors, and whether they know about his deal with Rick. He tells Maggie and Sasha to burn Glenn and Abraham's bodies and orders them to leave the Hilltop by morning. Gregory tells Jesus that if they leave, he has plausible deniability, and the Saviors won’t think they colluded to take down their outpost.

Sasha makes her bed in Jesus' trailer, where she and Maggie are staying the night. She asks Jesus to change Gregory's mind and offers to earn Maggie’s keep by scavenging for The Hilltop. Jesus gives her Abraham's brake light necklace. Maggie asks Jesus why Hilltop residents burn their dead -- "What do you have to remember them by?" Jesus simply says, "Us." The Saviors secretly leads walkers flooding in through the front gate, drawn by the music, Jesus helps Sasha and Maggie kill walkers. When they arrive with 
Simon
 leading them, Gregory tells Jesus to hide Maggie and Sasha in the foyer closet, however Jesus secretly hides them in his closet. Jesus watches as Gregory leads Simon to the closet, he finds boxes of scotch. Simon says Negan will be pleased and orders a nearby Savior to put the liquor in Negan's truck. On his way out, Simon orders Gregory to kneel, which he does with little resistance. He and the Saviors leave.

He releases Maggie and Sasha from Gregory's bedroom closet. Gregory yells at Jesus for hiding them there instead of the foyer closet. Jesus stands up to Gregory and forces him to let Maggie and Sasha stay. Jesus threatens to reveal Gregory's deal with Alexandria, stripping him of his plausible deniability. Suddenly, Maggie punches Gregory in the face, reaches into his pocket and takes Glenn's watch, which Gregory stole from the grave.

Jesus tells Maggie and Sasha that initially, he couldn't imagine anyone but Gregory running the Hilltop. "I can now," he says cryptically. Maggie leaves. Sasha asks Jesus to find out where Negan lives, but to keep it a secret from Maggie. Jesus agrees to follow the truck that's heading back to the Saviors' compound.

The Saviors leave the Hilltop. Jesus sneaks into the truck that's bound for their compound. He hears a voice say, "Hey," and looks towards the back of the truck to see Carl peeking out from behind some boxes.

On their way out, Jesus is shown hiding on top of the truck and stays behind at the compound.

"
Rock in the Road
"


Jesus is seen with Rick and the others in the Hilltop mansion, trying to get Gregory to join the fight against the Saviors. Jesus even calls out Gregory, sarcastically calling him brave. After Gregory decides not to help, Jesus and the others learn 
Enid
 had been asking Hilltop members to join the fight, to which they decided to do. Jesus reveals to them a long-range walkie-talkie stolen from the Saviors; they can listen in and hear if Negan dispatches his men to Alexandria  

Afterwords, Jesus then decides to take Rick and the group to the 
Kingdom
, to meet 
Ezekiel
. He leads them to the outskirts of the Kingdom, where they are greeted by 
Richard
 and 
Alvaro
. Jesus makes introductions and explains that they have similar interests. After some hesitation, Richard invites them to follow him.

When taken in to meet Ezekiel, he is happy to see Jesus and asks if Rick and his friends are new allies, he says they are. Jesus introduces him to Rick and requests Ezekiel to join in on Rick's plan to fight the Saviors, which Ezekiel ponders heavily. Ezekiel reprimands Jesus for telling Rick about his deal with the Saviors. They plead their case; in the process, Richard urges Ezekiel to fight the Saviors before things get worse. However, Ezekiel is reluctant to violate the peace he holds with the Saviors and refuses the offer, but he offers asylum in the Kingdom to Daryl. Jesus and the others leave, while Daryl stays at the Kingdom. On their way back to Hilltop, they encounter a group of cars blocking the road with a wire that, when pushed, will set off explosives, set by the Saviors. Jesus and the others are able to disarm the explosives, but when walkers close in on them and Saviors heading to Alexandria, Jesus and Sasha were told to head back to Hilltop on foot by Rick.



"
The Other Side
"


Jesus and Maggie work on plans for the future of the community. Gradually, the people of Hilltop begin to look to her as a leader as she gives residents knife-throwing lessons, in preparation for the war against the Saviors. In Jesus' trailer, Maggie falls asleep while working at the kitchen table. Jesus hands Sasha his map of Negan's compound.

Maggie apologizes to Jesus for taking over his trailer. Having grown up in a group home, it doesn't bother him. With Maggie, Sasha and Enid, he feels close to people for the first time. Maggie leaves to speak with the blacksmith about making spears they can trade with the Kingdom for body armor.

Jesus and Enid catches Sasha taking some bullets hidden in a book. Jesus allows her to take the bullets, but he begs Sasha to delay her mission until more people can join her, however Sasha refuses.

Outside, Kal warns everyone that the Saviors are coming.

Jesus watches as the Saviors leave with 
Harlan Carson

Gregory summons Jesus to his office and hands him job assignments for the newcomers. Jesus accuses Gregory of letting the Saviors take Dr. Carson and splitting up groups to protect himself. Gregory warns Jesus against talking back to him. Gregory says he's realized they're no longer friends.

Later, Rick's group sets off the explosives near the Oceanside walls. Jesus and Daryl capture 
Beatrice

Kathy

Season 8

"
Mercy
"


Jesus is first shown when Rick gives a rousing speech to the united communities, reminding them that Jesus told him that their world is gonna get bigger and they're fighting for their futures, for a bigger world. He vows to stop the Saviors and kill Negan, the only one who truly has to die. Maggie and Ezekiel echo Rick's sentiments.

The caravan arrives in a large field, where members of all three communities are waiting. Maggie insists on joining the initial phase of the fight, despite being pregnant. Ezekiel offers to let Maggie see the Kingdom's doctor, but Jesus assures him they'll retrieve 
Harlan Carson
, who was previously taken by the Saviors. Rick vows to relinquish leadership and follow Maggie after the fight is over. Ezekiel is eager to reshape this world.

Rick's group guns down two sniper lookouts at the Sanctuary as Dwight nonchalantly walks inside. The caravan arrives at the front gate, parking in formation to create a wall with the metal sheets retrofitted onto each vehicle. Maggie gives the signal and the group raises their guns toward the sky, shooting in unison. Negan steps out with his lieutenants.

Negan tells Rick that he lacks the numbers to win a fight against the Saviors. At Negan's command, Simon brings Gregory outside. Gregory declares that the Hilltop stands with Negan and the punishment for fighting against the Sanctuary is banishment for the offenders and their families. "The Hilltop stands with Maggie!" Jesus shouts.

The militia begins firing at Negan's crew. They runs for cover in different directions. Rick's group continues firing, blowing out the Sanctuary windows. The herd approaches, drawn by the explosion.

Rick’s group continues to spray bullets at the Sanctuary, then retreats to their cars for evacuation.

Jesus is later shown with a small group of soldiers from the militia (which includes Morgan, Tara, and Dianne) stands outside the fence of the satellite station outpost they previously cleared out. It has since been re-settled by Saviors.



"
The Damned
"


Jesus is among the Hilltoppers to sneak into the Satellite Outpost that has been re-occupied by the Saviors in order to take it over. Jesus Morgan, Tara, and Diane prepare for a raid on the Satellite station. Jesus insists if a gun fires they won't get in. Jesus tells Tara to ensure no one gets the chance to do that.

At the satellite station, Morgan bangs on the fence to attract walkers. Two Saviors head over to investigate. Diane shoots them in the head with arrows almost simultaneously. Jesus, Tara and Morgan venture inside. They use silenced pistols to put down Saviors. Diane whistles the rest of the group in. They form up outside the various inhabited rooms and await Jesus' signal to attack. 

Jesus gives the signal, and the Militia soldiers burst into the rooms and begin taking out Saviors, catching them by surprise. Morgan, Freddie and Andy prepare to breach a door, but before they can do so, a Savior opens it, and they promptly gun him down. Unbeknownst to them, at least half a dozen others were behind a corner, and before they can react, Freddie and Andy are killed and Morgan is concussed. 

As they sweep the station, Jesus and Tara discover a Savior named 
Dean
 cowering in a closet, having seemingly peed himself in fear. He claims to be a worker from the Sanctuary forced from his family. Jesus decides to show mercy and let him live, but Tara is furious, desiring to kill all the Saviors out of revenge for 
Denise
. Outside the room, Dianne and the others have been pinned down by Saviors, and the gunfire provides a distraction for Dean to take Jesus hostage, revealing his deception. Before he can shoot Tara, Jesus swiftly disarms him with his skills in martial arts. Regardless, he refuses to kill Dean, instead choosing to tie him up, much to Tara's disgust. Diane calls them out of the room and they flea. Jesus leads them out, leaving Morgan behind with Andy and Freddie dead. 

Outside, Jesus leads the rest of the fighters to the back exit of the compound, intercepting around a dozen fleeing Saviors, including Alden, who appear to consist mostly of workers. Heavily outnumbered and outgunned, they surrender without a fight, but Tara angrily declares that even if Maggie listens to Jesus' reasoning, Rick will listen to hers. Morgan, having survived his wound, heads outside and he is shocked to see the Militia taking hostages. He remembers his argument with Rick over whether or not it is worth preserving life, even that of an enemy. He is shaken from his trance when he sees 
Jared
 amongst the captured Saviors. He is prevented from killing him by Jesus, who insists that they do not kill those who surrender. Morgan disagrees but allows them to live. 



"
Monsters
"


Jesus is among the Hilltop and Alexandrian forces escorting the around 30 captured and shackled Saviors along a road at by armed guard. Jesus remarks that they aren't far from the Hilltop, but Morgan is still angry with the decision to spare the lives of the Saviors. Jesus insists it was the right thing to do despite telling him that no matter what they've done, they're still people. He firmly tells him there are many kinds of danger, they kill, but they don't execute. Morgan retorts that he has in fact done so in the past.

On the road, a number of walkers roll down a nearby hill towards the convoy and chaos erupts. Two Saviors are killed, and as the Militia members are preoccupied with the threat, a group of 10 Saviors led by Jared make a break for it, running off into the woods. Morgan gives chase, firing at them as they flee. When he catches up to them, he kills the one that caused them to slow down, and is only stopped from executing the rest by Jesus' intervention. 

Dianne and 3 other Militia members escort the Saviors back to the road while Jesus tries to reason with Morgan, who insists that the Saviors will not and cannot change. Jesus tells him that Maggie will find another way and they're gonna have to find a way to peace. Morgan begins to mentally break down, ranting about how things never change. He insists that the Militia have to be killers just like the Saviors in order to survive. Jesus says that after the war is won they will have to find a way to live with the Saviors, but Morgan refuses to listen. He attacks Jesus who dodges his attacks and kicks him back. Morgan forms up with his Aikido and attacks again.

Jesus and Morgan continue to fight. Jesus tries to get through to him, but Morgan is unresponsive, and continues to attack, to Jesus' confusion. He is able to avoid Morgan's strikes with his stick, and take advantage of the openings he leaves to wear him down. Morgan still refuses to stop. He scores a hit on Jesus' stomach, severely winding him, and another on his arm, but Jesus blocks the third hit and kicks Morgan away. As he goes in for another kick, Morgan maneuvers back out of his reach, and takes his standing leg out from beneath him. He tries in vain to score several lethal hits as Jesus dodges and gets to his feet, knocking an increasingly erratic Morgan to the ground. He uses trees as cover to evade most of Morgan's strikes but is eventually apprehended and knocked to the floor. He manages to get to his feet and disarm his opponent, knocking him away with another kick. When he returns him his stick, Morgan holds it to his throat as Tara and Dianne arrive. Morgan finally snaps out of his trance, in a state of confusion, realizing what he has done. He tells Jesus that he isn't right, but that doesn't make him wrong either. He concludes that he can't be a part of the war, and leaves on his own.

Jesus' group arrives with the captured Saviors. Gregory immediately insists that they can't stay, but Maggie sends him away while she talks to Jesus. Tara says she agrees that they shouldn't be allowed to stay, and Maggie notes that with families and children at the Hilltop, the arrangement would be dangerous. Jesus insists they can't kill those who surrendered, and makes plans to keep them under armed guard in two empty trailers.



"
The King, the Widow, and Rick

Jesus is seen handing out food to the Saviors. Maggie bursts in and orders him to stop giving away the Hilltop's food. Gregory suggests killing them but Maggie orders him away. Maggie is frustrated with Jesus for creating this situation. He is shocked that she would consider killing these men. Maggie says everyone option's in the table and Jesus questions what are they fighting for, Maggie says they must end the Savior and Negan.

At night, Jesus watches the Hilltop from outside the walls with the Saviors. He hears walker in the woods. Alden questions Jesus of what they are building inside. He vouches for himself and explains why he was a part of the Saviors. It all started with putting up a fence. Jesus cuts him off. "Don't pretend that any of us are innocent," he said.

The next day, Jesus is still keeping watch on the captured Saviors. Enid emerges and tells Jesus that Maggie has ordered the Saviors inside. They have built a holding area to keep them. "We'll keep the prisoners here," Maggie said. "We'll feed them. We won't mistreat them." However, they won't accept anything less than cooperation. Gregory says they shouldn't have people at the Hilltop who they can't trust. She agrees with him, which prompts Eduardo and Cal to put him in the same prison. Jesus, Enid and Aaron look on.

Jesus enters Gregory's office and thanks Maggie for doing the right thing, but Maggie shuts him down saying she's only keeping them alive because she believes they are bargaining chips and is looking to trade them for their people they have like Carson, and she says if it doesn't work out, they will kill them. Jesus is disappointed by this.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


Jesus and Maggie are driving, leading a caravan of Hilltop people. Maggie thinks that the Saviors will have to surrender sometime soon. They stop when they see a tree in the road and Maggie knows that the Saviors are the ones who put it there. As they stop, a line of Savior vehicles comes up behind their caravan. In front of Maggie's car, the Saviors open the back of a truck and pull out 
Jerry
, keeping a gun to his head. 
Simon
 exits the truck and addresses Maggie.

Simon tells Maggie that a group of Saviors is taking over the Kingdom, and another is taking over Alexandria. He says that she's lucky because the Hilltop is useful and he will keep them alive to help make things right. Simon says that 
Eugene
 is the one who figured out how to escape the Sanctuary. He then tells Maggie she can either cooperate with him or kill her in front of her all her people. Even if she cooperates, they will have to kill one of her people. Despite Simon's threats to kill Jerry, Simon tells Gary to lower his gun and proceeds to shoot 
Neil
 in the head, killing him instantly, much to Jesus's horror. Maggie says she will cooperate but asks him one favor first. She wants to borrow the box that he was going to use on her so that she can bury Neil, the man he shot. He grants her favor and leaves.

Jesus and Maggie head back to Hilltop and Maggie tells Eduardo to let Dean out of the cage. She shoots him in front of all the others, for giving Jesus trouble back at the Satellite Outpost, and proving that she's in control, and also payback for Neil's death. Jesus is shocked by this and attempts to talk to her, but she tells Jesus to man the wall and prepare for the last stand.



"
Do Not Send Us Astray
"


Jesus is among the Hilltop residents and refugees who are prepared to defend the Hilltop from the Saviors. He and the others manage to survive the attack as the remaining Saviors flee. The next day, Jesus keeps an eye on the prisoners, and locks the prisoners in the pen. During the night, screams ring out from the Barrington House. Inside, Maggie sees people getting eaten by walkers. Daryl rushes in to help people. Jesus helps put walkers down inside. The next morning, Jesus helps Jerry dig graves for the people they lost.



"
Wrath
"


Jesus accompanies Rick and the rest of the militia to fight the Saviors in the final battle. As Rick's army crosses a field, Jesus suggests Morgan abstain from killing people by reserving the sharp end of his stick for walkers and the blunt side for the living. A massive herd looms in the distance. 

After most of the Saviors are wiped out due to Eugene's faulty bullets, Jesus and the others fight the surviving Saviors until they surrender. He watches on as Negan is defeated and captured while Rick addresses the crowd, declaring peace among all communities. Afterwards, Jesus returns home to the Hilltop.

In Maggie's office at the Hilltop, she privately talks to Jesus. She tells him he was right to bring the Saviors at the Hilltop. She is angry at Rick and Michonne, believing that they were both wrong for keeping Negan alive. When Jesus suggest what to do about it, Maggie alludes to later rectify this error once the Hilltop has time to regroup and fortify and show Rick he is wrong. Daryl also agrees to this as he comes out of the shadow.

"
A New Beginning
"


On the road, Jesus and Aaron kill some walkers. Aaron asks Jesus if he can teach him some of his skills, to which he agrees to teach him in a class at the Hilltop.

Later that day, Jesus and the group go to the Smithsonian in 
Washington, D.C.
, to search for a covered wagon and farming equipment. However, he stays outside as a lookout along with Tara, Aaron and Alden.

Shortly after, the group leaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities.

On the road, Rosita and Daryl catch up with everyone to inform them that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Rick tells Tara, Gabriel, Aaron and Anne to head back to Alexandria and the rest will go to an alternate route and spend the night at the Sanctuary.

In the woods, the wagon gets caught in the mud as walkers appear from the bushes. It finally budges and everyone rushes to gather the supplies until the walkers overwhelm them and they're forced to leave. Ken runs back to free his horses but is bitten in the arm by a walker and then kicked in the ribs by the horse.

Siddiq and Enid try to save him but Ken succumbs to blood loss and dies from his injuries. A saddened Maggie sobs by his side before putting him down.

At night, in Hilltop, Jesus attends Ken's funeral and listens to Gregory's eulogy, believing he's a changed man. 

The next day, at night, the residents, including a shocked Jesus, gather around the gallows as Maggie explains to her people that the punishment fits the crime. She looks on at Gregory, who has a noose around his neck and is sitting on a horse. Gregory pleads for someone to stop this, but no one moves. A couple of kids show up and Michonne yells for Maggie to stop but it's too late as Daryl smacks the horse and it rides off, leaving Gregory to hang to death to everyone's shock.

Maggie tells her people that she wants this to be the last time they do something like this and then orders Daryl to cut off the noose.



"
The Bridge
"


In Hilltop, Maggie rides a horse as Michonne arrives. She tells Maggie that a planned food supply delivery hasn't arrived at the Sanctuary, but Maggie claims that the ethanol didn't arrive either. Jesus remains quiet.

Jesus confirms they have a surplus of food but Maggie counters that without a working plow it may not last long. Michonne suggests they let Earl out to repair it but Maggie scoffs and says she’s fine with waiting for the fuel to show up from the Sanctuary. Michonne decides to stay to spend the night.

Later, Tammy begs Jesus to see Earl but he says the time isn't right, reminding her he tried to kill Maggie. Tammy grabs a stool and says she's not moving until Maggie allows her to see him. Michonne overhears and tells Jesus to consider talking to Maggie about it, but he says it’s not her concern. Michonne disagrees and proposes that they need to build something bigger than all of them.

Jesus tells Maggie, while she plays with Hershel, that they should consider implementing official rules to handle situations like Earl, Negan and Gregory. She finally agrees.



"
The Obliged
"


In Hilltop, Jesus watches as Maggie grabs a backpack and sneaks a crowbar into it, planning to head to Alexandria to take care of Negan. He mentions that 
Georgie
 has send another letter and tries to convince her not to go but is ignored and instructed to look after the Hilltop while Maggie is gone.



"
What Comes After
"


In one his hallucinations, Rick walks trough a floor full of the corpses of his friends and loved ones, among them Jesus.

On the bridge, as Rick limps away before collapsing, he hallucinates as Jesus and the others rush past him to kill the walkers. Michonne stops and sees Rick's wound. She reminds him she fell in love with him because he's a fighter. After killing the walkers, everyone stops to watch them. Michonne tells Rick how much she loves him and he tells her, 
"This isn't real."
 Michonne tells him to wake up and he does, now alone on the bridge.

The walkers approach as Rick hobbles away. He makes it across the bridge and turns around hoping to see the walkers fall through, to no avail. A walker makes its way inches away from Rick before getting shot in the head by a crossbow bolt. Rick watches as Jesus and the rest arrive nearby.

Maggie and Michonne hatch a plan to divert the walkers but Rick won't allow it. He notices the dynamite on the bridge, takes aim, and says to himself 
"I found them,"
 before shooting and igniting the dynamite. The bridge ignites and explodes as Jesus and the rest can only watch in horror, assuming Rick to be dead.



"
Stradivarius
"


At some point, during the six years after Rick's supposed death, Maggie, along with Hershel, left Hilltop to join 
Georgie's group
. Following her departure, Jesus was elected as the new leader. Tara, knowing he doesn't like the responsibilities, moves to Hilltop to help around.

Six years later, inside the Barrington house, Jesus listens to music. Tara joins him and asks about any news on Maggie. He reveals she and Hershel are with Georgie and she has send another letter, where she admits to be happy.

Tara updates him on some minor problems at their community and congratulates him on being reelected as the leader. He reminds her he ran unopposed, but Tara suggests he should take Maggie's office and he refuses.

On the road, Aaron jumps Jesus on horseback and the two playfully fight in a field until they're worn out and go sit to catch up. Jesus asks if Michonne has reconsidered joining the upcoming fair but Aaron said she won't even put it to a revote. Suddenly, a flare is fired in the air close by and they rush over to investigate. They find Rosita wounded by a tree, who tells them she left 
Eugene
 in a barn. Before some walkers get close, they grab her and promise to look for Eugene tomorrow.

At night, Tara updates Jesus on Rosita's condition and asks what he was doing out there. Jesus confesses he was training Aaron while trying to get Alexandria on board with the Fair. She scolds him and tells him that people are noticing his constant absence from Hilltop. She reveals she’s leaving tomorrow to look for Eugene and that he needs to stay.

In the morning, Daryl, Carol and Henry arrive and hug Tara. Carol tells Jesus that Henry wants to learn how to be a blacksmith. Aaron greets Daryl and tells him they could use his help locating Eugene. Henry tries to tag along but Carol instead says he needs to stay and she will help him find a home.

The rescue group gears up as Jesus tells Tara he will go instead of her and next time he promises to stay, to which she agrees smiling. With 
Dog
 leading the way, Daryl, Aaron and Jesus head out to find Eugene.



"
Evolution
"


In the woods, Jesus, Daryl, and Aaron discover a herd middling around in the middle of a field. As they leave, an odd looking walker watches them from the herd.

Later, Jesus tells Aaron that Daryl used to trade with Hilltop before he stopped coming to visit. Aaron encourages him to embrace his new leadership role when Daryl cuts them off and says he can hear the walkers nearby through the wind. As they leave, Jesus looks with suspicion at the incoming herd.

At night, Jesus, Daryl and Aaron locate Eugene hiding in a barn cellar. A terrified Eugene warns them a herd of walkers is looking for him and they need to leave immediately. 
"This wasn't a normal herd... They were whispering to each other,"
 he tells them. They look at him confused, when suddenly Dog barks, warning them of the nearby herd. 

In the foggy woods, Eugene suggests to the group that the walkers are evolving. Daryl calls bullshit when Aaron notices they're drawing closer. Jesus demands they split up but Daryl says that instead, he will guide the herd away while he and Aaron take Eugene to the horses.

A while later, Jesus, Aaron and Eugene end up at a foggy cemetery. They quickly get trapped by a locked gate, forcing Aaron and Jesus to go kill the walkers, while they hear whispers around. Suddenly, Daryl, Michonne, Magna and Yumiko arrive to help them unlock the gate. 

Jesus tells Aaron and Eugene to get out while he finishes the walkers and starts taking out several with his sword. He goes to kill the last one but as he attacks it, the walker dodges and stabs him from behind through his chest, shocking everyone. 
"You are where you do not belong"
 the walker whispers to a shocked Jesus before throwing him on the ground.

Daryl shoots it in the head as several more arrive, wielding knives, and the rest of the group run in to finish them off. Afterwards, Aaron goes over to Jesus' body and looks at him in sadness.

Whisperers
 and walkers around them. When more arrive they’re forced to carry Jesus’ body away.

Later, the group arrives at Hilltop with Jesus' body and the captive girl, causing the whole community to react in sadness and disbelief.

A while later, Jesus is buried and a funeral is held for him, with everyone taking turns hammering the nails in his coffin.



"
Bounty

Trivia


The casting call for this character used the name 
Jason
.

Jesus was described as "Late 20s to 30s. Caucasian/Latino. Smart, friendly, and charming with a puckish sense of humor. He can be a thief, but he'll only steal half of what you have, and only if he knows it won't cause any permanent damage. He's generally a benevolent guy who makes friends with everyone he meets."


Unlike his 
comic book counterpart
, Paul does not possess the surname "Monroe". That was probably done due to not make him erroneously accredited to the Monroe family.


Paul prefers the nickname, "Jesus", as his friends at the 
Hilltop Colony
 call him that. This is due to his uncanny resemblance of Jesus Christ not only in appearance, but in behavior.

Richard
 is the first character to refer to Jesus as Paul.


Tom Payne
 on Jesus possibly being gay on the 
show
: "What I find interesting from the 
comics
 is that it's not a big deal. He just is who he is. And I enjoy the fact that in the show, they want to do right by the characters. So, um... you'll find out! What I will say is that the showrunners and everyone who works at the show respect the vision of the characters. We haven't gotten to that aspect of the character, but I think everyone will be happy."

Robert Kirkman
 confirmed in Letterhacks #164 that Jesus is indeed gay on the show. This makes him the sixth LGBT character alongside 
Tara
, 
Alisha
, 
Aaron
, 
Eric
, and 
Denise
 being the third known gay male.


Kari Skogland
, the director of "
The Next World
", wanted a take of Jesus looking a naked Rick up and down and smiling. In addition, Tom Payne believes that Jesus was not unconscious in the car ride to Alexandria and intentionally fell onto Daryl's arm, indicating his attractions to Rick and Daryl.


It was officially confirmed in "
The Other Side
" that he had trouble getting close to most people, including boyfriends.


In the original script for "
A New Beginning
", Jesus was set to have a boyfriend. However, this was not included in the final version of the episode. It is unknown who his boyfriend was, or if the show intended to establish a character or select a Hilltop background extra to fulfill the role of the boyfriend.
[4]


In the original script of "
The Next World
", Jesus drops down into a horse stance, but the writers decided that they shouldn't give up that he's a super capable fighter. They instead worked on evasion techniques.

TV Universe

Siddiq
, the fifth being 
Sebastian Milton
, and the sixth being 
Lance Hornsby
.


Jesus is the first character who was killed by the 
Whisperers
 on-screen.


Besides the nickname of 'Jesus', Rovia's name is Biblically significant in several other ways 'Paul' was, of course, an Apostle, and 'Rovia' (presuming a middle initial of 'S') could be rearranged to spell 'Savior'.


Paul is one of the most used names in 
TV Series
 with it being used three times. Jesus is the second character introduced to be named Paul.

Including variations of Paul such as Paulie and 
Paula
, this makes it the second most used name in the TV Series, with there being 6, only behind 
Michael
. Jesus is the third character introduced to be named some variation of Paul.


Jesus is one of four main characters to not be killed by a main character or walkers, the others being 
Beth Greene
, 
Siddiq
, and 
Alden
.

Jesus and Alden are also the only two main characters to be killed by an unnamed character.


Regarding the anthology spin-off 
Tales of the Walking Dead
, Tom Payne mentioned he would like to have an episode that featured the love story of Jesus and Aaron between Season 8 and Season 9.


Jesus appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode "
Rest in Peace
