Overview
[
]


Due to not being able to work and needing medication for her mother, Amber volunteered to be one of 
Negan
's wives. However, overtime this takes a tole on Amber's mental state. After Negan finds out that Amber had been cheating on him with 
Mark
, Negan has Mark punished by burning him with the iron. This causes Amber to become extremely depressed and believes being Negan's wife is a fate worse than death. When 
Eugene
 is allowed to hang out with Negan's wives, unlike 
Frankie
 and 
Tanya
 who play with him, Amber sits away from the group and drinks with a very cynical attitude.

Later that day, Amber stands with the other wives and is petrified to witness Mark's face being ironed by Negan as 
Sherry
 consoles her.

 as he plays video games. However, she sits away from the group, drinking motionless and not listening. Shortly after, the wives accompany Eugene outside and watch as he makes a homemade bomb.
