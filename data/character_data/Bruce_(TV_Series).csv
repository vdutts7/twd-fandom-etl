,,,"Bruce is a friendly, valiant, and caring man. He looks out for his friends and is willing to fight for what's right. After walkers attack the construction site and fellow worker 
Francine
 is injured, he initially stays back under 
Tobin
's orders and leaves Francine to die. However, after 
Abraham
 saves Francine and fight back, Bruce becomes decides to join them, going against Tobin's orders. Bruce seems to act as a voice of reason among the crew, telling them they should call it a day when tensions are high.
After the 
Wolves
' attack that killed many 
Alexandrian
 residents, Bruce becomes cynical and pessimistic. He is among those who raid the pantry for food, despite 
Olivia
's pleas, saying he doesn't want to spend his last moments with his family starving. Though after 
Spencer
 gets everyone to calm down, Bruce is ashamed for his actions. Later after a large herd of walkers invade Alexandria, Bruce and many others are inspired to help kill all the walkers.
After the 
Saviors
 take over, Bruce joins the 
Militia
, putting his life at risk for his community. Sadly, during an attack on 
Hilltop
, the Saviors had tainted their weapons with walker blood and Bruce is one of the victims who had been infected. Knowing his time is up, Bruce begins to break down saying someone has to put him down since he can't do it himself.","Nothing is known about Bruce's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he had a wife and a child.","At some point in the apocalypse, Bruce and his family joined a community called the 
Alexandria Safe Zone
 where, upon being interviewed by 
Deanna
, he was appointed as a member of the construction crew.
Over time, Bruce aided his crew in gathering materials from a nearby mall construction site to be used for the upcoming expansion of the community's walls, which lasted for around eight weeks.
Bruce is working at the Woodlands Mall construction site gathering materials with the construction crew when the site is attacked by a herd. He helps fight off the walkers after watching as 
Abraham
 rescues an injured 
Francine
, who was abandoned by 
Tobin
. Moments later, Bruce remains working after Abraham starts leading the team.
Bruce is among the townspeople present at the community forum to discuss 
Rick
's fate. He also witnesses the murder of 
Reg
, which he is horrified at, and the subsequent execution of 
Pete
.
Bruce attends the meeting at Deanna's house regarding how to handle the mega herd at the quarry. In the following days, he is among the volunteers to help build the wall on one of the roads to deter the mega herd in the operation to lure it away from Alexandria. When the walkers break free from the quarry and the plan is set into motion, Bruce heads out to his assigned location to keep walkers from straggling off the road.
Bruce returns to Alexandria and works with Tobin to transport the bodies of the residents killed in 
the Wolves
 attack to the graveyard. When Rick arrives at the community with the horde behind him, he helps open the gate to let Rick inside and listens to Rick and 
Aaron
 as they address the crowd. Afterwards, Bruce along with several other residents attempt to raid the food of the pantry despite 
Olivia
's pleas until they are eventually calmed down by 
Spencer
. Later that day, he watches in horror as Jessie is forced to put down a zombified 
Betsy
.
Bruce takes shelter inside one of the houses when the herd invades the community. That night, he witnesses Rick and other residents slaughtering walkers in the streets and is inspired to join the group where they battle the entire herd for hours until dawn when all the walkers are finally killed.
Bruce is present at the meeting in the church, listening to Rick's speech about the danger of 
the Saviors
. When Rick asks if anyone objects to the idea of attacking the Saviors for supplies from the 
Hilltop Colony
, he remains silent.
Bruce is outside near the front gate with 
Anna
 and 
Scott
 watching the Saviors enter Alexandria to raid the community. Later that day, he is among the residents present at the church when Rick informs them that he is no longer in charge and that all guns need to be turned over to the Saviors.
At one of the gates to Alexandria, Bruce is among Tobin, Daryl, Scott, and several other residents packing cars with weapons and supplies as members of the militia prepare for their assault on the Sanctuary. That night, Bruce is outside in the street with Tobin, Daryl, Rosita, Tara, and Scott as Negan and a group of armed Saviors arrive at one of Alexandria's gates. Bruce, Tobin, and Scott, are instructed by 
Carl
 to get to the infirmary and help evacuate the injured residents to the sewers. Later, Bruce is seen safe in the sewers with the surviving Alexandrians.
Bruce remains in the sewers with the other residents as the Saviors' grenades continue to blow apart Alexandria above them. After the explosions subside and the remaining Saviors leave, Bruce and the others leave to 
Hilltop
 for refuge.
Bruce and the other Alexandrians travel through the woods towards the Hilltop. When they come upon a swamp, he and the rest of the group rest in the woods while 
Daryl
, Scott, 
Rosita
, and 
Siddiq
 clear the walker infested waters. Afterwards, Bruce and the Alexandrians arrive at the Hilltop and are welcomed into the community with open arms.
Bruce is among the militia to help defend Hilltop from the Saviors. He is wounded in the arm by a tainted weapon but survives the attack. That night, Bruce rests in a room of survivors, including 
Bertie
. After witnessing a zombified Tobin attack Bertie and Carol saving her in time, he and the others realize what killed and turned their friends. A sickly Bruce then begs someone to put him out before he turns and is mercifully killed.","Killed By
