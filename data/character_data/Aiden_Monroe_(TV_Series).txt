Overview
[
]


Aiden is initially shown to be a reckless and hot-headed bully. Though he is friendly at first, when 
Glenn
 kills a walker against his orders, he irrationally gets angry at him despite the walker almost killing them. Later a physical fight breaks out between the two. Even his 
mother
 seems to be well-aware of Aiden's behavior and thanks Glenn for punching him. However after the confrontation, Aiden appears to have become more cooperative and works together with Glenn on the next supply run. However, Aiden's recklessness causes him to accidentally shoot a grenade on a walker, blowing him back and getting him impaled. At the end of his life, Aiden admits to being a coward who got many of his own supply runners killed. He tells Glenn to leave him behind so they can escape.



Pre-Apocalypse

Ohio
, United States
[
]


Nothing is known about Aiden's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he has a father 
Reg Monroe
, a mother 
Deanna
, and a brother 
Spencer
. He was also in the ROTC and was close to receiving a lieutenant's commission.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


When the plague started, Aiden was with his parents. With his mother being a congresswoman, they were expected to come back to Ohio to help the district manage the crisis caused by the epidemic. However, he and his parents were stopped by the US Army and directed to a community in Alexandria for safety. After a while, the army never arrived in Alexandria, leaving Aiden and his family, along with other refugees, to build walls around the community. Using construction materials from an unfinished shopping mall nearby, he helped his dad build a perimeter, and as more people arrived, they assisted the Monroes in the completion of the wall.

A month prior 
Rick Grimes
 and his group's arrival to the Alexandria Safe Zone, Aiden was scouting with 
Nicholas
 and four other runners in a town not far from the community. Unfortunately for the scouting party, they were attacked by walkers and the four runners were killed, leaving Aiden and Nicholas as the only survivors. In retaliation for the walkers killing their friends, the men began trapping and tying up walkers to be killed before supply runs.



Season 5
[

"
Remember
"
[
]


Aiden and Nicholas meet with 
Tara Chambler
, 
Glenn Rhee
, and 
Noah
 in order to train them as runners for future missions. While out in the woods, Aiden explains to the newcomers that they are to follow his instructions. They soon approach a bloody rope used to restrain a walker, which had escaped. The men start making loud noises to lure it, much to the dismay of Tara, Noah, and Glenn. When the walker emerges from the bushes, Nicholas and Aiden attempt to capture it. Tara tries to help, but the rotting walker proves too much, causing Glenn to step in and stab it in the head, angering Aiden. Back in town, Aiden confronts Glenn, which turns physical and ends up with Aiden being punched by Glenn until his mother steps in and orders Aiden to back off.

Aiden and his team of runners (including 
Eugene Porter
) lead an expedition to a storage warehouse. Before leaving the walls of Alexandria, he exchanges a few words with his parents, each of them worried about his safety. He tells his father to take care, to which his father states that he should be the one to tell Aiden the same.

Upon their arrival at the warehouse, Aiden is quick to point out their fastest route, in and out, before Glenn tells him that they should scout the perimeter to find all their exits if things were to go awry, to which Aiden agrees. Once their reconnaissance is over, the group discovers a group of around two dozen walkers trapped behind a chain fence. Aiden, looking unnerved by the number of walkers, compliments Glenn's knowledge and strategies, and suggests they get to work. While pairing with Nicholas, he turns to find that he is being followed by a single armored walker, and began to shoot it several times, once in the leg, in attempt to stop its advances. Despite Glenn's protesting, Aiden impulsively continues shooting, accidentally hitting a grenade on the walker's bandolier, causing an explosion that severely injures Tara and impales him on a shelf, knocking him unconscious. Nicholas pronounces him dead and has the others leave his body in the interest of protecting Tara.

While the others tend to Tara's injuries, Aiden comes to, alerting the bunch, to which Glenn calls on Nicholas and Noah to help retrieve him from the debris. Aiden is then comforted by Glenn before his and Nicholas' attempt to remove him from the impalements as walkers close in on the four. After their struggle to remove Aiden, Nicholas leans in towards Aiden, whispering to him that the two left their friends behind on runs to save themselves, saying it was how they were, before running off to save himself. Glenn, still convinced he could save Aiden, tries one last time to remove him from his fate, to which Aiden reveals that he had gotten the four former runners killed because he had broken the rules of his own system. He then tells Glenn to stop his attempts at saving him, before Noah pulls Glenn away, leaving Aiden to be swarmed by the walkers, who then proceed to tear open his stomach and eventually kill him.

Trivia
[
]


Aiden was credited in "
Forget
" but did not appear in the episode.


While this character's name is 
Aiden
, a behind the scenes video posted by AMC erroneously credited him as 
Aidan
.


Aiden is the first member of Alexandria to die after Rick's arrival.


Aiden is the first member of Monroe family to die.


As given by Greg Nicotero, 
Daniel Bonjour
 cut his honeymoon short to take the role of Aiden.

Also given by Nicotero, his made-up honeymoon time was the reason Aiden did not appear in "
Try
", and had to be killed in "
Spend
".


Daniel Bonjour, who portrays Aiden, originally auditioned for the role of 
Gareth
, but he was called back as the role of Aiden suited him more.


Aiden appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of "
Lockdown
" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.


Aiden is one of seven 
Alexandria
 residents to be an antagonist, the others being 
Spencer Monroe
, 
Pete Anderson
, 
Carter
, 
Nicholas
, 
Ron Anderson
, and 
Vincent
.
