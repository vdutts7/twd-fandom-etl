Overview
[
]


Tobin has been shown to be a fair, caring, easygoing and hard-working man who rarely loses his temper. He holds a very strong presence in the community being an efficient worker and proven to be safe with firearms marking his effectiveness to the safe zone. However he has shown on one occasion to be willing to sacrifice members of his crew to preserve the lives of others as exampled with Francine.

Despite this flaw, Tobin has proven to show a great deal of care for the residents of the community as he does whatever he can in order to help others in need, showing great levels of bravery and integrity. Despite the setbacks of the community impending peril Tobin has proven to be optimistic and practical to the people around him as exampled with Rick acting as a voice for the people of Alexandria and encourages Rick not to give up on them.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Virginia
[
]


Tobin grew up in Virginia, although not much is known about his early life. As a young adult, he originally worked in middle-management employed within a blue-collar industry. He later became a laborer, and worked in construction upon where he acquired a distinct knowledge and skill of the trade. 

Tobin grew to become a family man where he at some point married a woman and settled down together where they formed a family. However the fate or whereabouts of his wife are unknown, indicating that his wife either divorced from Tobin and was left to raise his children as a single parent or alternatively she died to unknown circumstances. 



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At some point during the outbreak, Tobin and his family made their way to the Alexandria Safe Zone where they settled into the community and quickly became a trusted member of the Monroe family's inner circle. Upon being interviewed by 
Deanna
, Tobin was appointed as foreman of the construction crew, alongside Bruce, Francine, Tommy, and Carter. He helped managed the team in gathering materials from a nearby mall construction site to be used for the expansion, which took about 8 weeks.



Season 5
[
]


"
Forget
"
[
]


Tobin and another Alexandria resident enter the armory and request permission from 
Olivia
 to sign out weapons. He introduces himself to 
Carol Peletier
, who is at the armory to gather ingredients for cookies, and offers to teach her how to shoot a gun. Later, Tobin can be seen socializing at Deanna Monroe's party, interacting with residents and the new arrivals.



"
Spend
"
[
]


Tobin and his construction team are starting the process of expanding the wall. While gathering materials from the mall construction site they are attacked by numerous walkers. During the gunfire, the lookout 
Francine
 is knocked from her perch atop a bulldozer's plow after Tobin accidentally shoots the lift's wires. Tobin reluctantly orders the rest of the construction crew to retreat behind the trucks instead of saving Francine, but Abraham rushes in and manages to save her life before killing the remaining walkers. Abraham confronts him over his behavior, and Tobin insists that he was simply following their system and tries to get Francine to back him up, but she instead punches Tobin in the face.

Tobin returns to Alexandria while Abraham takes charge of the construction crew and explains what happened to Deanna, 
Reg Monroe
, and 
Maggie Greene
. He recommends to Deanna that she name Abraham the new head of construction, as he sees him as a more fit leader than himself. She agrees, and Tobin leaves with Reg, promising that she will not regret putting her trust in Abraham.



"
Try
"
[
]


Tobin witnesses the fight between 
Rick Grimes
 and 
Pete Anderson
 in the streets. Rick points his gun at Tobin after he makes a move to stop Rick. Afterwards, he listens to Rick's speech before he is knocked out.



"
Conquer
"
[
]


Tobin is seen talking on the street as Rick greets him and walks on by. He is later present with his family and the other Alexandria members at the meeting to discusses Rick's fate, where he tells his worries about the safety of his family if they do not exile Rick. He is interrupted when Rick appears, carrying a walker that made it into the community. Tobin is shocked when Rick shoots Pete after the latter drunkenly murders Reg.



Season 6
[
]


"
First Time Again
"
[
]


Tobin appears first alongside Father 
Gabriel Stokes
, when the two are digging graves for Reg and Pete. Rick comes by and tells them to only dig one grave and that they do not bury killers within their walls. Tobin sympathizes but protests that it is not his decision, until Deanna comes along and agrees with Rick, ordering Pete's body to be dumped outside the wall. Tobin later attends a meeting where Rick reveals he and 
Morgan Jones
 discovered a massive herd of walkers trapped in a quarry nearby, and that they will soon get free. Tobin volunteers to help develop a plan to herd the walkers away from Alexandria.

A few days later, Tobin meets with Olivia, 
Spencer Monroe
, Francine, and 
Carter
. Carter urges Tobin and the rest to help him kill Rick. Although skeptical about Rick's leadership, Tobin is against Carter's plan, and when 
Eugene Porter
 is caught spying on them Tobin tries to convince Carter not to shoot him. Tobin watches as Rick arrives and defuses the situation by disarming Carter and sparing his life.

Tobin and the rest of survivors that will redirect the quarry herd head out to go over the steps of their plan, which they intend to put into action the next day. When they reach the quarry, the trailer on the far side of the quarry falls, allowing the herd to emerge onto the road leading to Alexandria. Tobin enters one of the trailers blocking the other exit and moves it, allowing the herd to emerge onto the other road, and quickly rejoins his team on foot, being in charge of dispatching or herding any walkers along the west side of the road. Tobin maintains radio communication with Rick, who is leading the team on the other side of the road.



"
Thank You
"
[
]


Rick attempts to reach Tobin on the radio, telling him to fire more guns to redirect the herd. Tobin's voice is faintly heard through the heavy radio static, but he doesn't respond, likely having not received the message, and Rick is unable to contact him further.



"
Now
"
[
]


Tobin and his team have returned to Alexandria and help cleanup in the aftermath of 
the Wolves
 attack. Alongside 
Bruce
, Tobin gathers the bodies of the deceased Alexandrians and Wolves and takes them to the graveyard. When Rick is heard yelling from outside the walls, Tobin rushes to the gate with his knife at the ready. He witnesses Rick enter the town just ahead of the herd. Tobin gathers with the rest of the town near the section of the wall where a Wolf crashed a truck, which has been reinforced, and listens as Rick reassures everyone that they will survive the herd and they just need to stay smart and patient. Tobin watches with concern as Deanna leaves without saying anything, and calls after her but is ignored. Tobin later witnesses 
Jessie Anderson
 putting down 
Betsy
, who turned inside her house after committing suicide.



"
Heads Up
"
[
]


Tobin is seen helping Rick with the wall. Rick assures Tobin the wall will survive as long as they shore it up. Tobin recalls the day that Rick and his group got to Alexandria. Tobin remembers how scared everyone was when they saw Rick stroll through the gates with his beat up group and his beard. He then goes to say that he and the others were reluctant to change their way of life when Rick gave his speech shortly before the deaths of Pete and Reg. Tobin then acknowledges that Rick has been right all along and that he and the others will fight. "Don't give up on us," Tobin urges to Rick.
Tobin, along with many of the other residents of Alexandria, notices the watchtower outside leaning towards the wall and then runs and watches in horror as the Alexandria tower falls and destroys a part of the wall.



"
Start to Finish
"
[
]


Tobin is first seen having been knocked down on the ground due to the impact of the watchtower after it fell on a part of the community's wall, which then allowed the herd outside to enter Alexandria. He is then helped up by both Tara and Rosita where they all flee from the oncoming herd.



"
No Way Out
"
[
]


Tobin is among the townspeople taking refuge in 
Father Gabriel
's church, along with 
Anna
, 
Judith
, and 
Bob
. He witnesses Rick slaughtering zombies by himself in the streets and is inspired to join the group as he sees other townspeople arrive to help. Before he leaves the church to fight, he listens to Gabriel's speech about courage. He is among the residents to battle zombies for hours until they are all killed. After the bloody cull, he rests outside the infirmary with the other survivors.



"
Not Tomorrow Yet
"
[
]


As Carol hands out homemade cookies to the children and other residents, she stops by Tobin's new house, located in the recently-expanded part of town. She gives him a container of cookies and they both flirt. He is also present at the church with many of the other townsfolk, discussing the Saviors and the plan to kill them all as a part of their new alliance with the Hilltop Colony. That night, Carol walks by Tobin's house and the pair share a cigarette, talking about Carol going on the Savior mission. He admits that Carol is capable of doing things that terrify him, and explains his view that she can do such things because of her motherly instincts. He adds that many Alexandrians see her as a mother figure, but she's something else to him and they kiss. Subsequently, Tobin is among those left behind to defend Alexandria while Rick and others attack the Saviors' outpost.



"
Twice as Far

Trivia
[
]

Tobin is the third supporting character to outlive his comic book counterpart, with the first being 
Ed Peletier
, the second being 
Scott
, the fourth being 
Kal
, the fifth being 
Bruce
, the sixth being 
Luke Abrams
