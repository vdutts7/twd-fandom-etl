,,,"Glenn is quick thinking, bright, loyal, resourceful, and quick on his feet, which makes him the group's primary supply runner. Keenly aware of the extreme dangers in which he places himself for the sake of the group, his youth makes him willing to take the risk. Glenn thinks on his feet while also showing great compassion and humanity. Despite all of the horrors he experiences, he maintains a youthful enthusiasm for life and its unexpected pleasures. He's an integral part of the group, showing surprising depth and emotion even when experiencing the most devastating tragedies.
While on the farm, he begins a relationship with 
Maggie Greene
. Over the latter half of season two and through the third season, he becomes very close and loving towards her, doing whatever is necessary to keep her safe. He is trustworthy and loyal, as seen in the episode ""
When the Dead Come Knocking
"" when Glenn and Maggie are captured by 
the Governor
, he is brutally interrogated by Merle but refuses to reveal where the rest of Rick's group have set up camp.
Glenn's love for Maggie and his close bond with her father, 
Hershel Greene
, leads Glenn to become less of the group ""canary in the coal mine"" and more of his own voice. Upon Hershel's death, Glenn pledges to take over his role as conscience and hope, which involves decisions like protecting 
Tara Chambler
 (in spite of her ties to the Governor) and encouraging his leader, 
Rick Grimes
, to free the other captives of 
Terminus
. However, after discovering that 
Eugene Porter
 is lying about Washington, D.C. and discovering that Maggie's sister 
Beth
 is alive, only to see her dead in the same day, Glenn becomes noticeably colder and less trusting. He says that he himself would have killed 
Dawn Lerner
, who accidentally killed Beth, and that he would not have stopped to help the man trapped in the storage container at Terminus, whom he had convinced Rick to rescue. Despite becoming rather distant, Glenn is still unable to kill another living person, as seen when he plots to kill 
Nicholas
 for Noah's death and for trying to kill him. He is unable to go through with it, demonstrating that he has not completely gone cold.
Glenn has shown to be uncomfortable with killing living people, tearing up when he stabs a sleeping Savior (his first kill), as well as being shocked at the sight of the Saviors that him and 
Heath
 massacred in self defense. However, despite being unsettled by the though of killing, he is willing to do what is necessary to protect his community, Maggie, and his unborn child.
In his final moments, Glenn was only concerned with Maggie's welfare, showing how devoted he was to his wife, despite his devastating injuries. His final words were directed to her ""Maggie, I'll - I'll find you"", and confirmed that he would always love her, even after death.","Glenn was born in the mid-1980s, he grew up in Michigan and was raised alongside his sisters by their parents, who were immigrants from Korea. Not much is known about his early life, except that he may have been a boy scout (as indicated from a t-shirt he wore).
By his early twenties, Glenn had moved to Atlanta where he found employment as a pizza delivery boy, after graduating from an unknown school. At this time, Glenn felt stuck in a rut since he did not take all of his opportunities to find a better career and passively stayed in his underachieving job.
[1]
 It was during this period where he gained insightful knowledge regarding the city streets and layout.","During the onset of the outbreak, Glenn was rescued by 
T-Dog
 near Atlanta. Sometime later, they encountered and joined a 
campsite of survivors
 outside the outskirts of the city. For a time Glenn fell into a state of depression when he realized he'd never see his family again, but eventually came to accept their probable deaths and moved on. Over time, Glenn became the supply runner of the group and would go to the city to scavenge.
In 
Atlanta
, inside a tank and with several walkers outside the streets, 
Rick Grimes
, unsure of what to do next, holds a soldier's Beretta pistol to his forehead, sweating. Suddenly, the tank's radio crackles. 
""Hey. Hey you, dumbass. You in the tank. Cozy in there?""
 Glenn sarcastically says over the radio. Rick looks up and slowly lowers the gun from his forehead.
In Atlanta, Glenn replies that Rick is surrounded by walkers and advises him to make a run for it while they're distracted and busy eating his horse. Rick pops through the top hatch and dispatches a walker with his shovel, jumps off of the tank, and runs down a nearby sidewalk toward an alleyway, shooting walkers along the way. He turns around a corner and is surprised by Glenn. They race up a ladder to the roof, stopping to catch their breath on a platform halfway up. Glenn introduces himself and Rick thanks him for saving his life.
While they walk across the roof, Rick asks Glenn why he stuck his neck out for him back there, to which Glenn replies, 
""Call it foolish, naive hope that if I'm ever that far up shit creek, somebody would do the same for me. Guess that makes me an even bigger dumbass than you,"" 
leaving him in thought. Glenn leads Rick down a staircase to an alley, which is free of all but four walkers thanks to a bus blockade. Glenn radios his group, prompting T-Dog and Morales, wearing riot gear and brandishing baseball bats, to emerge from the building and beat down the walkers. Rick and Glenn rush into the building, followed by them.
Inside the store, Andrea points a gun in Rick's face, furious at his recklessness. 
""We're dead because of you,"" 
she tells him. Morales informs Rick that his gunshots have attracted numerous hordes of walkers. 
""You just rang the dinner bell,""
 Andrea seethes, as the group's attention turns to a crowd of walkers outside that are slamming themselves against the the store's front doors, furiously trying to gain entry. The group questions Rick about what he was doing roaming around the streets. Rick tries to explain he was trying to flag down a helicopter. Jacqui suggests that it was just a hallucination. 
""I saw it,""
 he insists forcefully. T-Dog tries to make radio contact with another unknown group, but fails to get a signal, wondering if they might have better luck on higher ground. Suddenly, muffled gunshots are heard. 
""Oh god, is that Dixon?""
 Andrea says in disbelief, as they all leave to investigate.
On the roof, Glenn and the group find Merle firing at walkers with a rifle. T-Dog chastises him for wasting bullets and attracting more walkers. Merle scoffs at him and calls him a slur, which sets off a fight between the two. Glenn watches scared as Merle beats T-Dog and presses a handgun to his forehead. Rick intervenes, hitting Merle with the butt of the rifle and handcuffing him to a pipe.
Morales informs Rick there's no refugee center and that they are part of a larger group of survivors staying outside the city, but T-Dog can't reach them on the radio. 
""We're on our own,""
 Rick says. With the streets no longer safe, Rick suggests they try to escape underground. Jacqui says that the building might have access to the sewers, prompting Glenn and the group to head back downstairs to the basement. In the basement, Glenn concocts a plan and he and Morales head down the sewer.
In the sewer, Glenn and Morales walk with caution til they reach a grated barrier. They discuss ways to cut through, but they soon abandon the idea when they see a walker devouring a rat on the other side. The walker reaches at them through the grate and they step back. Glenn, Morales, and Jacqui arrive with the others to report that the sewer is not an option. Glenn and the group heads to the roof.
On the roof, Rick spots a cube van at a nearby construction site. The group discusses the difficulty of moving past the walkers undetected. 
""They smell dead. We don't. It's pretty distinct.""
 Andrea says. Rick latches onto the concept of scent and how the dead use it to differentiate between themselves and the living. A while later, Rick and Morales collect a dead walker from the alley. Inside, Rick acknowledges the walker's lost humanity and then begins hacking the dead body to pieces with an axe. Glenn and Rick then smear guts on themselves, disgusting everyone.
Outside, Glenn and Rick crawl under the bus blocking the alley. They start to shuffle in to the streets, mixing in to the crowd of walkers unnoticed. Suddenly, a rainstorm passes over them, washing the guts off their jackets. The walkers detect them as humans, prompting Glenn and Rick to fight them while continuing to run to the construction site. They are able to make it over the fence uninjured. Rick shoots at walkers while Glenn locates the keys. The crowd of walkers knocks down the fence and charges at them, but they speed away in the van just in time. Rick orders Glenn to radio the group to get ready for pick-up, and mentions that they will need a way to lure the walkers away from the department store, eyeing a red Dodge Challenger sports car.  Rick smashes the driver's side window to gain entry, causing the car's alarm to blare loudly.
On the road, Glenn leads the walkers away from the store and speeds out of Atlanta while screaming in celebration.
After they all get back to the camp-site and reunite with the other survivors, Glenn is asked by Rick to go with him back in the city because he knows his way in and out. He leads Rick, 
T-Dog
, and 
Daryl Dixon
 to the building that Daryl's brother 
Merle
 was handcuffed onto. Heading up the stairs they find no walkers. On the roof, Daryl calls out to Merle, but they only find Merle's hand, a bloody hacksaw, and the bloody handcuffs.
When Rick decides to go back for Merle he enlists the help of Glenn because of his knowledge of the city. Glenn reluctantly agrees and joins the party to go save Merle. In the city, they realize that Merle was able to escape by cutting off his hand and after following Merle's bloody trail the group starts to organize how to get the 
bag of guns
 back. Glenn organizes the plan to get the guns like a skilled tactician arguing that he's agile enough to get in and out of the streets. At one point Daryl asks Glenn what his profession was before the apocalypse to which Glenn replies, ""Delivered pizzas. Why?"" Glenn succeeds in acquiring the weapons, but is taken hostage by a group called the Vatos who also want the guns. Rick and the group come to the Vatos hideout with a hostage called 
Miguel
 but the negotiation goes badly and both groups draw their guns on each other. The battle is interrupted by 
Abuela
, a woman who reveals to the group that the Vatos are actually looking after an abandoned nursing home and its residents. The group decide to split the guns between themselves and the Vatos group, and return to the spot where they left the van only to find it missing. Assuming Merle to be the culprit, they immediately head back to camp and are just in time to fend off an attacking herd of walkers.
After the attack on the camp-site which left many people dead, he and the others struggled to decide what to do with Jim, who was bitten. Glenn says his goodbyes to him, as does everyone else, and leaves the man sitting by a tree. Glenn and the group arrive at the 
CDC
 only to find it seemingly abandoned, and they are about to leave until a door opens, bathing the group in light.
Following their arrival at the CDC, Glenn takes advantage of the building's luxuries (food, clean clothes, etc.), and follows around the rest of the survivors. He, along with everyone else except for 
Jacqui
 and Dr. 
Edwin Jenner
, escape the building before it explodes, and then head to 
Fort Benning
, a military base.
Glenn was forced to stop along with the others when 
Dale Horvath
's 
RV
 breaks down. He is then later seen fixing an old truck, and 
Shane Walsh
 finds water nearby. When a herd of zombies come their way, he hides under a car with Shane. 
Sophia Peletier
 then gets chased by a duo of zombies and the group looks for, but she is not found by the end of the episode.
Glenn and the group continue to look for Sophia when all of a sudden 
Maggie Greene
 appears on a horse and takes Lori and tells Glenn and the others to head to their farm they make it back to the highway, but Sophia's mother 
Carol
 does not want to go and wants to keep looking for Sophia. Dale, Daryl, Carol, and 
Andrea
 stay at the RV to see if Sophia comes back while Glenn and T-Dog head to the farm.
Glenn makes it to the farm with T-Dog and watches Hershel perform surgery on Rick's son 
Carl
. He then sits out on the porch, prays for this to end and starts to form a relationship with Maggie (Hershel's daughter). Glenn then waits for Shane and 
Otis
 to return to the farm with the supplies. Shane reveals that Otis is dead and Glenn feels sorry even though he didn't know him.
At the farm, Dale and T-Dog find a walker inside of one of the wells, and the group quickly rallied to devise a plan to rescue the walker from the well without contaminating the water. The survivors then lower down Glenn as bait. The plan goes awry when the old rusty water pump they’re using as a pulley breaks, sending Glenn within reach of the ravenous reverent. They save Glenn who, despite his panic, managed to lasso the corpulent creature. Unfortunately, the risk and subsequent struggle to haul out the zombie is all for nothing, as its rancid body gets snagged on the lip of the well only to rip in half, dropping its fetid bowels into the water below.
Later, Glenn and Maggie go for an excursion to the local pharmacy to get more medical supplies and a pregnancy test for Rick's wife 
Lori
, and while they are there, they end up having sex.
Glenn is frustrated by Maggie's hot and cold behavior towards him. He shares a theory with Dale that all of the women are acting strangely because their menstrual cycles are aligning. Dale advises him to keep that theory to himself, and also discovers that Glenn and Maggie had sex. He mentions that Hershel would likely not approve, to which Glenn replies, ""Tomorrow I might be dead."" Glenn is the only person at this point that knows Lori is pregnant. Maggie passes a note to Glenn during dinner asking him where he thinks they should have their second sexual encounter, and he replies the (barn) loft. But Maggie does not read his reply right away. Glenn sets out to investigate the barn and wait for Maggie, but makes the shocking discovery that the barn is already in-use as a containment and concealment vessel for numerous walkers.
Glenn, unable to hold the secret of the barn, tells Dale about it, as well as Lori's pregnancy. After this incident, Maggie feels betrayed by Glenn and initially refuses to speak with him, though she does another run into town with him. While there, Maggie is attacked by a walker and Glenn jumps in to rescue her. They manage to get Lori´s morning after pills, which Rick finds.
Glenn reveals to the whole group that there are walkers in the barn. Maggie is again frustrated by Glenn's inability to keep secrets, but he reassures her that it was to keep her safe. Later, when he participates in the shooting at the end of the episode with Shane, Andrea, T-Dog, and Daryl, he first looks at Maggie for approval of shooting, and she agrees.
At Hershel's home, Maggie asks Glenn if he would stay if the rest of his group were to leave, but Glenn is unsure how to answer. Beth suddenly grows ill and collapses. She suffers from a fever and other serious symptoms, and seems to be in some state of shock. The group looks for Hershel to care for Beth, but discover that he has vanished, leaving behind his empty flask as a clue. Rick decides to look for Hershel at the local bar, and takes Glenn as backup. En route to town, Glenn confides to Rick that Maggie told him she loved him. Rick says that they need more good things like that in their lives, and that he should embrace those moments. At the bar, Rick and Glenn find Hershel and tells him about Beth. Hershel reflects that he had robbed his daughters of a normal grieving process by giving them a false hope, and allowing himself to believe it too. Hershel also says that Rick must relate, saying he saw the same feeling wash over Rick's face when Sophia emerged from the barn that there is no hope. Rick argues that nothing has really changed, and people are counting on them to be strong. They are interrupted when the bar door opens and two strange men walk in, identifying themselves as 
Dave
 and 
Tony
. The five men converse cordially at first, but the strangers become impatient when Rick's group will not divulge information about the Greene farm. Glenn and the group are immediately untrustworthy of the strangers when Tony loses his patience and says he is considering shooting them all. When Dave reaches for his gun, Glenn watches as Rick pulls out his gun and shoots the two men.
At town, after killing Dave and Tony, Rick, Hershel, and Glenn are about to leave but instead get pinned down in the saloon by members of Dave and Tony's group: 
Sean
, 
Nate
, and 
Randall
. Rick tells them that Dave and Tony pulled their guns out on them first but the group begin to shoot. Rick tells Glenn to check the back exit. As Glenn walks down some creaky steps and approaches the door, a shadow outside reaches for the handle and begins to twist it but Glenn shoots through the glass and scares him off. Rick tells Hershel to cover Glenn while he makes a run for the car. A man named Sean who was part of the group sneaks up behind Glenn and attempts to shoot him but Hershel shoots and wounds Sean, who starts crying out in pain. Rick asks Hershel what happened, he says he thinks Glenn was hit. Rick finds Glenn is just frozen in fear behind a dumpster and approaches him. Rick, Hershel, and Glenn return to the farm with Randall blind folded in the backseat as a hostage. The group argues on what to do with Randall, Rick says they will fix him up and than drop him off to defend himself but Shane thinks that he will tell his group where the farm is and this will start a war. Hershel reminds Shane that it is his farm and while he is there he needs to keep his mouth shut. Maggie pulls Glenn aside and asks him if anything is wrong, he explains how her father saved his life, and that he froze and could not do anything to help. He had froze because she told him that he loved him, and he was afraid to die because of how it would affect her. She tries to embrace him, but he pushes her away.
In the farmhouse, Glenn finds Hershel checking up on 
Beth
. Hershel asks Glenn about his family and tells him about his own Irish heritage. He hands Glenn a pocket watch that belonged to his grandfather. ""
No man is good enough for your little girl,
"" Hershel says, ""
until one is
"". As the sun sets, Rick again asks Lori if she thinks he's doing the right thing. Lori nods. The group gathers in the house. Rick asks if anyone thinks Randall should be spared. Dale posits that the only people who think so are himself and Glenn, but Glenn too sides with Rick. ""He's not one of us,"" Glenn offers. Glenn along with all the other survivors gather around Dale before he is shot by Daryl to prevent reanimation.
Glenn attends at Dale's funeral and is sad because he regrets going against the latter's wishes to spare Randall, but Andrea comforts him and tells him that Dale was proud of him overall and knew how much Glenn cared for him. Later, Randall disappears from the barn and while the group is looking for him Shane emerges from the woods claiming Randall has escaped and is armed. Glenn and Daryl are sent to look for him in the woods. They are attacked by a walker, and when Glenn kills it, it turns out to be a reanimated Randall. Both Daryl and Glenn are puzzled by the lack of bites on his body, and also find it strange how his neck had been snapped. They return to the farm to tell the rest of the group about what happened.
When the zombies invade the farm, Glenn and Maggie get into Shane's car and attempt to corral the zombies and lead them away from the farm. Glenn shoots multiple zombies until he realizes there is too many of them. When they are overwhelmed, Glenn convinces Maggie to leave the farm. As morning hits, the two continue to drive as Maggie feels shaken from the attack on the farm. She asks Glenn if her family escaped; he comforts her though insists that he drive instead. Glenn admits to Maggie that he loves her and he had loved her for a long time.
As they make their way back to the highway where the group left supplies for Sophia, they meet up with Rick, Carl, and Hershel who await them. Daryl, Carol, Lori, Beth and T-Dog also arrive. Glenn asks about Andrea, but T-Dog exclaims she ""went down"" during the attack. The group presses on but stops along the road when Rick runs out of gas. Rick's leadership is questioned when he reveals the secret he'd been hiding about the walkers; they're all infected. Glenn lashes out at Rick for not telling the group as he did when he told ""for the good of everyone"" about the barn. They take shelter for the night. A 
prison
 can be seen looming in the distance.
Glenn is seen with the group when they stumble upon the abandoned house and Rick, Carl, Daryl, and T-Dog kill the walkers inside of it. The group is forced to flee, however, when another herd of walkers begins to approach their location. After Daryl and Rick stumble upon the prison while hunting, Glenn helps out to distract and kill the walkers while Rick runs inside the prison yard to close the main gate. The next day, Glenn assists Rick, Daryl, Maggie, and T-Dog in killing the remainder of the walkers on the interior of the prison. The romantic relationship between him and Maggie continues as the two share a cell on the inside of the prison and cuddle as he checks Maggie for scratch marks. The next day after sleeping in the inside of the prison, Rick, Daryl, T-Dog, Glenn, Maggie, and Hershel suit up and explore more of the inside of the prison in search of its infirmary and cafeteria. The group is ambushed by walkers, causing both Maggie and Glenn to split up from the rest. Hershel insists that himself, Rick, Daryl, and T-Dog go back to look for them, and Hershel manages to find them, but is bit in the right calf by a lurker lying against the wall. Glenn assists them in taking Hershel to the cafeteria, and is present when Rick amputates the lower portion of Hershel's right leg to keep the infection from spreading.
Glenn is seen mostly by Hershel's side in the episode, and helps to console Maggie. Carol pulls him aside despite orders by Rick to stay at Hershel's side, needing his assistance in killing a female walker to use as practice for a C-section as she may be the one to deliver Lori's baby due to Hershel's condition and because of Carl being born that way.
Glenn is first called down from one of the guard towers, where he was having attempting sexual intercourse with Maggie, to help Rick, Daryl, Carol and T-Dog move some cars. He witnesses the beginning of the walker invasion, and he, along with Rick and Daryl, sprint to the gate so they can enter the prison and help out the group, as the ones trapped with the walkers are greatly outnumbered. He helps clear out the prison and to disable the alarm boxes by shooting them. He accompanies 
Axel
 to the generator room to disable the generators. He is present when the group discovers T-Dog's devoured body, along with Carol's headpiece.
Glenn is seen digging graves for Lori, Carol, and T-Dog. After allowing 
Oscar
 and Axel to dig the remaining graves, Glenn reveals to Hershel that he wishes they would have killed all of the prisoners on sight.
When Maggie goes out on a scavenging trip to find baby formula with Daryl, Glenn comforts her, telling her to be safe and that he loves her.
Glenn is later seen, pleading with Rick not to enter the room containing Lori's body. Rick retaliates, shoving Glenn into the wall, and walks away without a word.
Glenn announces that he and Maggie are planning on going on a scavenging trip. Glenn is seen driving a truck with Maggie into a supermarket parking lot. Unbeknownst to them, they are being watched by 
Michonne Hawthorne
. They open the door to be greeted by a crow, and some flying papers. Maggie then tells him to retrieve a duck toy, for the new baby. He also scavenges enough powdered formula to fill an entire shopping basket. Suddenly, they are confronted by Merle. Glenn is clearly surprised to see Merle still alive. Merle says he wants to travel back with them to their base to find his brother, Daryl, in which Glenn refuses. Merle attacks and takes Maggie hostage. With a gun to her head, he forces Glenn to drive back to 
Woodbury
.
Glenn is brutally interrogated by Merle, who yearns to learn the location of the camp where the Atlanta survivors have moved into. After viciously beating him, Glenn still refuses to talk. However, Glenn ends up angering Merle by head-butting him in the nose, prompting him to beat Glenn harder. After a while and still not talking, Merle releases a walker into the room. Glenn uses his feet to knock stuff on it, but eventually breaks the chair and stabs it. Merle comes back later with 
Martinez
, and behind them Maggie is held topless by 
the Governor
. Glenn assumes Maggie was raped and tries to attack them. The Governor gets angry and points his gun at Glenn's head, but Glenn says nothing. Maggie breaks and tells him everything. The Governor leaves along with Merle and Martinez. Maggie then runs crying into Glenn's arms.
Glenn and Maggie are first seen sitting in the room with the dead walker he killed in the previous episode. Glenn breaks off a shard of bone from the walker's forearm and hands it to Maggie. Glenn and Maggie ambush Merle and 
Warren
 successfully when they arrive to take them to the ""screamer pits"", but they are restrained when Martinez approaches and holds them at gunpoint. While being escorted away a second time, Rick's group arrives and uses a flash grenade, allowing them to rescue Glenn and Maggie. Glenn informs Daryl that Merle was the one responsible for torturing him, and Glenn takes part in the Woodbury shoot-out, despite being badly injured. Glenn also trains his gun on Michonne, along with Rick and Maggie, when she rejoins them outside of Woodbury following the shoot-out.
Glenn stays behind when Rick and Maggie attack Woodbury, and attempts to attack Merle when Rick, Maggie, and Daryl return to the road where he and Michonne are waiting. Glenn pulls a walker out from a truck, and begins to stomp on its head several times, appearing frustrated. Glenn is angered at Rick for not taking the opportunity to kill The Governor during the attack and for allowing Daryl to leave them by going with Merle. He is also infuriated about what he thinks The Governor did to Maggie, which is rape her. Rick tells Glenn that finding Daryl was the priority. Glenn is later seen being taken care of by Hershel, and it also appears that there is tension between him and Maggie.
Glenn proposes that the prison survivors defend themselves from The Governor by attacking Woodbury immediately, and inquires to Michonne about the town. Hershel, however, remarks that Glenn's decision to take over the leadership from Rick may be unwise at the time, due to Maggie still recovering from her and Glenn's detention and torture in Woodbury. He advises Glenn to comfort Maggie but Glenn first decides to search for the origin of the walkers with assistance from Carl. Glenn obliges to Hershel's request after completing this task. Upon talking to Maggie, he asks her why she is acting depressed, and she responds with explaining the abuse she endured from The Governor. He then asks her if she was raped, to which she responds with a ""no,"" which relieves Glenn, but annoys Maggie. After searching ""The Tombs"" of The Prison, he ventures outside to search for the breach in the building. He drives off, only to return again during The Governor's attack, just in time to rescue Hershel and Michonne.
Glenn is seen with the rest of the group, discussing the Woodbury situation, and sides with Rick's decision that they aren't leaving the prison. Rick, Glenn, and Hershel are discussing what to do with Merle. Glenn suggests using Merle as a bargaining chip for The Governor. When Andrea visits the prison, Glenn tells her that if The Governor wants a war, he's got one. Later, he gives Andrea a spare car to drive back to Woodbury in. When night comes and Beth sings to the group again, he sits with Maggie drinking a cup of water.
While Rick, Daryl and Hershel are away dealing with The Governor, Glenn makes the decision for the group and does not want anybody to interfere with Rick. Merle insists on going to kill The Governor, but Glenn angrily tells him no. Before Merle walks out the prison door, him and Glenn get in a brawl that Beth stops with a gunshot in the air. Glenn and Merle argue briefly before going separate ways. Glenn goes outside to check on Maggie and apologizes for how he's been acting. The two back up into the garage and have sex. When Rick returns to the prison, Glenn and the rest of the group listens to what Rick has to say.
Daryl attempts to have Merle apologize to Glenn for his wrongdoings, but Glenn tells Daryl that he would probably forgive Merle if it wasn't for the fact that he brought Maggie to The Governor, who terrorized and humiliated her. Glenn visits Hershel and says that he now understands why Hershel gave him the pocket watch and tells Hershel that he wants to marry Maggie. Hershel gives Glenn his blessing. Glenn goes to look for rings on female walkers and he cuts a finger off and gives Maggie the ring and she agrees.
Glenn appears shortly in this episode. He fends off the approaching Woodbury soldiers with Maggie in combat armor taken from the reanimated prison guards who were present in the prison when the survivors arrived. Later, he opens the gates to the prison for Woodbury citizens, looking stunned as he looks on with Maggie.
Glenn is seen waking up with Maggie. He tells her that he will go to the Big Spot, instead of her. Maggie shows concern, but Glenn says he will be fine with the riot gear. Later, when the group loots the Big Spot, he notices some baby things, but moves on. When the walkers start falling through the roof, Glenn is caught in a close encounter with two zombies. Glenn manages to fend them off, and gets out of the Big Spot alive. Later, when he arrives at the prison, Maggie tells Glenn she is not pregnant, much to Glenn's relief.
He is first seen watching Maggie as she sleeps before taking a picture of her causing her to wake up and the two talk quickly before he leaves the tower. He is next seen when cell Block D is attack and participates in getting rid of the walkers and evacuating the citizens. He then makes sure no one reanimates with the others and is attacked by an undead 
Patrick
, but is saved by Daryl. After this he meets with the rest of the ""council"" to discuss what is going on within the prison as well as creating a plan to separate people. Later he helps to try and deal with the walkers at the fence and watches as Rick and Daryl use the pigs to draw them away.
Glenn appears talking to Hershel about how the infection is spreading and that there is no stopping it. 
Sasha Williams
 walks out infected with the virus. Glenn later appears having come down with the infection and is taken to Cell Block A. it is possible that he may have got the flu off an undead Patrick who attacked him as no-one else is. Rick, Daryl etc weren't even touched by a sick walker. Later after tending to Dr. 
Caleb Subramanian
, Hershel tends to Glenn and encourages Glenn to fight through the infection.
Glenn's condition has worsened. He tries to keep himself busy and his mind off being (almost) fatally ill by helping Hershel tend to the other sick survivors. After a few of the other survivors die, most of them turn and wreak havoc in Block D. While attending one of the sick survivors, the survivor unexpectedly stops breathing. Glenn attempts CPR, but to no avail. He tries to call Hershel, but instead enters a coughing frenzy, which leads him to begin coughing and then choking on his own blood. He nearly dies, but is ultimately saved when Hershel grabs an incubator and gets help from Maggie in feeding it down his throat. His condition is stabilized and he manages to make it through the night.
Glenn is still unwell in Cell Block A. He has almost fully recovered from the flu but is still very weak. When The Governor begins to attack the prison, Maggie rushes over to collect Glenn and take him to the Prison Bus with the other survivors who are unwell. The bus takes off safely, but it is later shown that Glenn got out to look for Maggie, ending up on a walkway bridge that was blown up by the tank.
Glenn wakes up on a destroyed walkway in the prison, which is now swarming with walkers, and quickly retreats inside. It appears that he left the bus to search for Maggie and was on the walkway when the tank blew it up. In his room, he retrieves his riot gear and supplies before starting out of the prison, where he runs into 
Tara Chambler
. He helps her escape, and when later asked why he would want her help, he responds that he needs it to find Maggie. Tara informs Glenn of Hershel's death, and though saddened, Glenn shows more resolve than ever. The two are attacked by walkers and, during the fight, Glenn passes out.
Glenn wakes up on the back of the army truck and asks Tara if they passed the bus to prison. Tara tells him that it's been three hours since they passed, but she has driven down all the streets and that everyone on the bus is dead. Glenn wants to go back and look for Maggie, furiously banging on the back window of the truck with his automatic firearm, breaking it and causing its driver, 
Abraham Ford
, to stop the truck. Glenn tries to leave, but Abraham tells him that he is causing disruptions to 'The Mission.' After Glenn inquires about the mission, Abraham reveals that his companion 
Eugene Porter
 knows exactly what caused the beginning of the apocalypse, and that government officials are to meet with him in Washington.
Glenn tries to leave so that he can look for Maggie, but Abraham tries to talk him into staying, telling Glenn that Maggie could possibly be dead and there is no need for the two of them to go out the same way. Glenn punches Abraham and he jumps on top of Glenn, and the two fight. Abraham's lover 
Rosita Espinosa
 and Tara try pulling Abraham off Glenn. After Rosita helps Abraham, Eugene, Glenn and Tara clear out a herd of walkers that Eugene was shooting at with the M4A1 assault rifle. Rosita gives Glenn the photo of Maggie that she found, and Glenn, Tara, Abraham, Rosita, and Eugene depart to look for another vehicle to complete their mission.
Glenn appears first in the episode in a flashback to when he and Daryl first met 
Bob Stookey
, who was roaming the street. He is mentioned all throughout the episode by Sasha, Bob, and Maggie, who is determined to reunite with him by leaving signs telling him to go to 
Terminus
. He later appears at the end of the episode, where he comes across a Terminus sign.
Glenn is walking along the railroad tracks with Abraham's group and Tara in the daylight. Eventually, he and the others camp out at nighttime, picking up where they left off the next day. The group comes across a dark tunnel, Glenn wants to go through it since he sees Maggie's message written in blood, but Abraham suggests going around. Glenn says his goodbyes to Abraham, Rosita and Eugene here and gives his riot gear to Eugene. Tara decides to stay with Glenn. Glenn then proceeds to enter the tunnel and shines his flashlight at rubble. It is shown that walkers are stuck in the rubble, so Glenn begins investigating them. He is looking to see if one is Maggie. None of them are Maggie, so Glenn pulls out his knife along with Tara and kills them all. Glenn and Tara then proceed to climb over the rubble.
Once they get to the other side, Tara's foot gets stuck under a rock and it is shown that a herd of walkers are coming toward them. Glenn begins shooting at them and attempting to help Tara. He is unable to free her and she tells him to leave her. Glenn refuses and not long after, gunshots light up the tunnel. It is revealed to be Abraham, Rosita, Eugene, Maggie, Sasha and Bob. Glenn runs over to Maggie, hugging and kissing her. The group decides to set up camp in the tunnel for the night, so Glenn and Maggie talk. Glenn pulls out the picture of Maggie, but she insists he doesn't need it. Glenn burns the photo and the next day the group heads for Terminus. Eventually, they arrive at Terminus and are greeted by a woman named 
Mary
, who welcomes them into the town and offers them a plate of food.
Glenn is first seen in a flashback returning from a supply run. Glenn later appears in the train car at Terminus when Rick, Carl, Michonne and Daryl enter. Glenn hesitantly calls out to Rick, asking if it is really him.
Glenn and the others create makeshift weapons to fight off their captors, but the Terminus guards instead drop a flashbang grenade into Boxcar A, and drag Glenn, Rick, Daryl and Bob out. They are taken to the slaughterhouse and lined up bending over a pig trough next to another quad male survivors from another box car. One by one, the four other survivors are brutally slaughtered over the pig trough. Glenn, being the next in line, is about to be executed as 
Gareth
 walks in and questions one of the guards about the survivors. This diversion led to Gareth getting in an argument with Rick over his bag of weapons, further delaying Glenn's execution. Gareth then orders for the murdering to continue, but once the guard prepares to knock Glenn unconscious, an explosion abruptly stops him, causing Gareth to flee. Rick breaks free from his cuffs, kills the guards, then sets Glenn and the others free. The four soon discover that Terminus was planning to butcher them and use their corpses for food. Rick orders them to not put down the guards and kill any Terminus member on sight.
The four fight their way back outside, and Glenn convinces Rick to unlock a container with a 
survivor
 inside as an attempt to keep their humanity. However, the survivor is half-crazed, and eventually stumbles into a walker, which promptly eats him. Glenn appears shocked, but continues fighting through Terminus until the group reaches Boxcar A, where they free the remaining survivors. Maggie is extremely relieved to see Glenn alive. Glenn then leaves Terminus with the group, and is happy to be reunited with Carol, Tyreese, and Judith.
Glenn is seen with Maggie and she embraces him. Whilst on the move the next morning, the group hear screams for help. They go and assist the man from a group of walkers. He introduces himself as 
Gabriel
. He takes the survivors back to his church, which they quickly check is secure and not a trap. It's then decided that the group will need to go and fetch supplies. Glenn goes with Maggie and Tara to scavenge a weapons store, where he finds three silencers in a mini fridge. After Rick, Michonne, Gabriel, Sasha and Bob return from the food-bank with a lot of supplies, the group celebrate with a big supper. Glenn listens on as Abraham makes a toast to the survivors and expresses his desire for them to come with him to Washington D.C. Rick agrees to do so, and the group all laugh and celebrate.
When Rick, Tyreese, and Sasha come back inside the church after failing to find the missing Bob, Sasha wants to know where her people are, so she angrily confronts Gabriel. Rick steps in when she threatens to become violent, but he also confronts Gabriel, who confesses that he survived by refusing to take in people who needed his help. Glenn stands by the window and reveals that there's somebody lying on the grass outside. They rush out and find Bob with his leg missing. They carry him inside and Bob reveals what Gareth and his people did to him. Sasha insists that somebody fetch the first aid kit, but Bob tells her to save it, and reveals he was bitten at the food-bank. Sasha, Glenn and the others are upset, but they prioritize on making Bob comfortable. Glenn mentions Jim to Rick and reminds him that he lasted two days before they left him.
When Abraham announces that he's taking Eugene and leaving to ensure his survival, an argument breaks out between him and Rick when he insists on taking the bus. Glenn manages to stop this confrontation from turning violent by promising Abraham that if he stays for one more night to help deal with Gareth, then he and Maggie will leave with Abraham the following morning. Abraham reluctantly agrees.
Rick leads a group, which includes Glenn and Maggie, as they leave for the school to confront Gareth, who waits until they're gone and then breaks into the church to ambush the people left behind. Rick and co turn the tables on Gareth and Glenn, Maggie and Tara watch on in horror as Rick, Abraham, Sasha and Michonne brutally kill Gareth and his people.
The following morning, Glenn and Maggie say goodbye to Bob, who passes away shortly after. Abraham then decides it's time to go. Glenn bids farewell to Rick and gets on the bus with Abraham, Eugene, Rosita, Maggie and Tara, as they depart for Washington.
Abraham and his group are driving down a road in the bus as they journey to D.C. Glenn humorously questions Eugene about his hair. The bus suddenly breaks down and crashes when it collides with another car and flips. Everyone is safe but the group are forced to fight off the surrounding walkers, with Glenn and Abraham first out the bus. When it's suggested that they turn back to the church, an enraged Abraham refuses. Glenn offers reassurance, and confirms that he and Maggie will continue on, no matter what. Glenn further acknowledges that Abraham is calling the shots, but says he needs to know that Abraham is good. Abraham says he took a pretty good hit in the crash, but as long as they are rolling on, he's good. Glenn says, ""We're rolling on.""
The group continues their journey on foot. The group end up in a library and fortify it for safety. Glenn has a talk with Abraham, where he thanks him for coming with him. Glenn suggests that Abraham fix up his hand.
Glenn is sleeping next to Maggie. Maggie is staring up into space. Glenn asks if she’s thinking about them, and Maggie says she feels guilty. Glenn jokes around about having a vacation on a bookstore floor. Maggie says it's just good having this because it's not about what was, that it’s about what's going to be.
The next day, the group find a firetruck to use to get to Washington. When Abraham moves it forward, walkers begin pouring out of the warehouse behind. Glenn kills a few before Eugene turns on the fire hose to deal with the rest. Glenn mentions that there's a goodwill store where they might be able to get some supplies, but Abraham is eager to go. When they stop again, Glenn watches the perimeter. He then complains about the smell.
The group walks down the road and discovers an enormous herd of walkers. Glenn suggests a detour around but Abraham adamantly refuses, saying that he's not giving up the ship, that they can get through the herd and that they're not going around or turning back, much to the group's objection. Abraham grabs Eugene to take him back whilst the others try and stop him. When Tara tries to stop Abraham and he pushes her away, Glenn tells him that enough is enough. Abraham is about to get violent with Glenn when Eugene confesses he's not even a scientist and that he lied in order to be protected and survive.
This stuns Glenn and the others tremendously. Abraham responds in rage and violently punches Eugene several times. He collapses to the ground and Rosita is forced to intervene and threaten Abraham with her gun. He stumbles away and collapses to his knees in grief as Glenn and the others try and rouse Eugene.
After Eugene's bombshell and subsequent attack at the hands of Abraham, he remains unconscious and in a critical condition. Abraham is also non-responsive and he shuts himself off. Glenn and the others take charge, with him, Tara and Rosita going to fetch water while Maggie stays behind to watch over Eugene. Rosita shows Glenn and Tara how to make a water filter using a bottle, as Eugene taught her to do. Rosita tells the story of how she ended up accompanying Abraham on his mission. Glenn spots ripples in the stream, caused by a fish. Glenn and Rosita construct a make-shift net which they successfully use to catch the fish. Glenn tells Rosita the group will need her skills and he asks her if she's up for staying with him and the others, no matter where they end up. She confirms she is. Tara interrupts the conversation when she happily shows them a yo-yo she found. With food and water, the trio make their way back to Maggie, just as Eugene begins to come round.
With Abraham back in action, the group make their way back to the church just in time to save Michonne, Carl, Judith and Gabriel from a big group of walkers. Maggie and Michonne embrace one another and Maggie is ecstatic and emotional when she learns that Beth is still alive and Rick and the others have gone to rescue her. Tara suggests they go and join them, which they do.
After arriving at the hospital where Beth is being held, they arrive as Rick and the group are leaving. Maggie is evidently excited, but is crushed when she sees a tearful Daryl carrying Beth's corpse. Maggie drops to the floor in horror and sobs hysterically, as Glenn attempts to comfort her.
After Beth's funeral, Glenn ran for a supply run alongside Rick, Daryl, and Sasha. He covered Rick when the latter checked an abandoned truck, but found nothing. Later on, after Rick decided to set 
Noah
's community as their next destination. A walled community with 20 people in it. Glenn paid attention to what Rick said that despite the place is far away, if it turns out to be right, then they had to take the journey. Glenn asked Rick what if the place is not there anymore, not believing there's any hope to settle in anymore. Rick talked him out of it by telling him that they gonna keep moving on, before being added by Michonne who said, 
""then we'll find a new place.""
Glenn, Rick and Michonne head off to see what they can find. Rick and Glenn discuss the events at the hospital and their mutual desire to kill Dawn, despite the accidental nature of Beth's death. Glenn, formerly one of the group’s most steadfast optimists, admits to Rick that given all they've been through, if he had the chance to do it all over again, he wouldn’t have stopped to try and save the man trapped in the storage container at Terminus, and he would've killed Dawn without hesitation. However Michonne is becoming disturbed by the cynicism and tells them that they need to stop being in the open.
On the back of the community, Glenn listens as Michonne expresses her idea to stay in the neighborhood, but Rick offers several rebuttals. She argues that instead of just ""making it"" that they should go to Washington, D.C., where they might have a chance. After a moment, Rick agrees. Just then, Noah is heard screaming for help and the group runs off to save him from several walkers that have him cornered. He reports that Tyreese has been bitten and they set off in the direction of his house. Rick and Glenn hold Tyreese's arm while Michonne cuts it off.
Glenn and the group hauls Tyreese from the house and to the front gates. They smash the locks off and open the doors, walkers spilling in. They quickly dispatch them and carry Tyreese all the way back to their car. Tyreese grows weaker as they get to the car and Rick radios Carol to tell her that they have to cauterize the arm to stop the bleeding.
After a momentary stalling, in which the car gets stuck and then crashes into a truck filled with mutilated walkers - the upper halves of the legs seen by Glenn, Rick and Michonne, they manage set off. Tyreese dies peacefully whilst watching the sunset. The people in the car pull over after realizing he has passed away and come to a stop. They pull him from the car onto the road and Michonne puts him down, as the others are distraught.
Glenn appears when Maggie, Daryl, and Sasha came back from the woods. While they were driving they ran out of gas and they all start walking. Then Glenn and the others stopped when they see tons of walkers then they all started to kill them all. Then the others continue to walk when they spotted some cars. Then Glenn came up to Maggie and she saw a walker in the trunk then he opened the trunk and killed the walker. Then the group was relaxing when 4 dogs came out of know where, then Sasha killed them and they all had a barbecue. Then they kept moving then Glenn wanted to give Daryl some water but he didn't want it. Then the group found some water then Eugene tried to take a sip, but Abraham knocked the bottled of water of his hand, then they all hear thunder and lightning and then a tornado formed, but Daryl said, he found a barn then they searched the barn. Then at night Rick made a speech about his grandpa when he was in war, then he said a few words that we are The Walking Dead. Then Glenn got up and help his group to stop the walkers from breaking in, but it was all a dream.
Glenn goes with Abraham, Maggie, Michonne and Rosita to check for 
Aaron
's vehicles. He drives the car during the night run with Michonne, Rick and Aaron. When they hit a herd and crash through many walkers, the car gets stuck from guts in the engine. Aaron sees a flare and runs off after it, leaving the others to follow him. Glenn gets separated but fights off the walkers, eventually finding and saving Aaron, who then helps him save Rick and Michonne. When they meet up with the rest of the group and Aaron's boyfriend, 
Eric Raleigh
, Glenn tells Rick that everything is going to be fine if he lets the couple stay with each other. He then repairs the RV when it breaks down near D.C. He is then seen departing the RV as they arrive at Alexandria.
Glenn is the first through the gate into the Alexandria. In his interview he states that the group were almost out there too long. 
Aiden Monroe
 and 
Nicholas
 meet with Tara, Glenn, and Noah in order to train them as runners for future missions. While out in the woods, Aiden explains to the newcomers that they are to follow his instructions. They soon approach a bloody rope used to restrain a walker, which had escaped. The men start making loud noises to lure it, much to the dismay of Tara, Noah, and Glenn. When the walker emerges from the bushes, Nicholas and Aiden attempt to capture it. Tara tries to help, but the rotting walker proves too much, causing Glenn to step in and stab it in the head, angering Aiden. Back in town, Aiden confronts Glenn, which turns physical and ends up with Aiden being punched by Glenn until his mother, 
Deanna
, steps in and orders Aiden to back off. Deanna thanks Glenn for punching her son.
Glenn appears at the party at Deanna's house. When Noah reveals that he is having doubts about his place in both the community and with them, Glenn he reassures Noah that he is family now.
Glenn is seen loading supplies into the back of a truck for a supply run. Maggie stands near behind, waiting to wave him off, along with Deanna and Reg Monroe, Aiden's mother and father. As Tara, Eugene, Nicholas, Noah and Aiden pile into the truck, Deanna thanks Glenn for keeping his son in line. Maggie bids her husband goodbye and they pile into the truck towards the warehouse.
Upon their arrival at the warehouse, Aiden was quick to point out their fastest route, in and out, before Glenn tells him that they should scout the perimeter to find all their exits if things were to go awry, to which Aiden agrees. Once their reconnaissance was over, the group discovers a group of around two dozen walkers behind a gate. Aiden, looking unnerved by the number of walkers, compliments Glenn's knowledge and strategies, and suggested they get to work. Glenn pairs off with Noah and they begin to look around for the object Eugene needs. When Aiden is cornered by an walker with a shield over its head, making it difficult for Aiden to kill it. Glenn quickly notices the grenade hooked to the walker and screams for Aiden to stop. Aiden impulsively continues shooting and accidentally hits a grenade attached to the walker's belt-pouch, throwing everyone back from the force of it. The fence that held the two dozen walkers behind at bay to collapsed and allowed them out.
Glenn notices Aiden pierced against the wall, but Nicholas pronounce him dead without checking. He quickly finds Noah and they search for Eugene and Tara first. Eugene calls out for them and they find Tara passed out on the ground. Walkers approach Eugene and Tara, attracted to her blood. Noah saves them and helps carry Tara. Glenn calls for them to take shelter in the office. When they are behind the closed doors, Nicholas meets up with them and is shocked when Aiden cries out. Eugene tells them to go ahead and save him while he protects Tara.
Noah launches a flare in the opposite direction from Aiden, drawing the walkers away. They try to save Aiden, only for Nicholas to freak out and run. Glenn and Noah are forced to leave Aiden behind as the walkers get closer and closer. They chase after Nicolas as he runs out through revolving doors, only for all three of them to get trapped in two different compartments with walkers cornering them from all sides. Glenn quickly puts a plan in action as Eugene drives by, blaring music and pulling walkers away from one side. He tells Nicolas to hold onto the door as he tries to break the glass. Nicolas freaks out again and pushes his way out from his side, allowing the walkers to have access to Glenn and Noah.
Noah's leg is grabbed by the walkers, and he trips. Glenn grabs Noah's hand and tries to pull him back, but Noah tells Glenn ""Don't let go"" and allows himself to be pulled out of the door. After a struggle, Noah is pushed against the clear glass, getting devoured as Glenn watches. Glenn cries as Noah is torn apart in front of him, and is devastated when Noah finally dies. Enraged, Glenn leaves the building and gets back to the van outside of the warehouse. There, Glenn finds Eugene on the ground after being thrown out of the van by Nicholas, attempting to leave them, and all evidence to his cowardice, behind. Glenn knocks him out and throws him into the back of the truck. When Eugene asks where Noah and Aiden were, Glenn just tells Eugene to watch Nicholas. They drive back to camp minus two members and a barely alive Tara. Eugene holds the unconscious Nicholas at gunpoint per Glenn's orders.
His voice is heard at the end of the episode when they arrive back at Alexandria as he screams out ""Help!""
Glenn tells Rick the truth about everything that happened at the warehouse during the supply run, while at the same time, Nicholas is telling the complete opposite to Deanna and placing the blame for Noah and Aiden's deaths on Glenn. Glenn finds Nicholas cleaning blood out from the back of the van and threatens that he is no longer allowed to go out on supply runs or leave with anyone else for their own protection. Glenn and Nicholas are both seen rushing to the town square to witness the fight between Rick and 
Pete
.
Glenn appears along Abraham and Carol when they visit Rick, who is healing from his sustained bruises from his fight with Pete before. When Rick hatches a plan to take over Alexandria, only if Deanna and the others are up against them, he quickly tries to cancel the idea. Later, Glenn meets with Maggie after she spoke with Deanna, trying to figure out what the night's meeting would be about. Maggie informs him it would be just as they thought it would, and that she believes that she can convince the community to let Rick stay. Nicholas stalks Glenn while he is with his wife, waiting for Glenn to be alone. Glenn tells Maggie that he loves her before separating to prepare for the night's gathering. Nicholas then lets Glenn see him climbing over the wall to lure Glenn out of the community, and Glenn follows. Once Nicholas felt he had led Glenn far enough away from the community, he shoots Glenn, but Glenn survives and escapes Nicholas' sight. Nicholas then follows Glenn's trail of blood until Glenn attacks him from behind. During the scuffle, Glenn severely damages Nicholas' leg, but Nicholas regains the advantage by exploiting Glenn's bullet wound. Before Nicholas could kill Glenn, a walker intervenes, forcing Nicholas to retreat. The walker attacks Glenn as more join to try and eat him. Nicholas leaves Glenn to die, and begins his injured walk back to Alexandria. After nightfall, a still alive Glenn attacks Nicholas again and breaks the latter's ankle. Glenn then punishes Nicholas for getting Noah killed by beating him down. Glenn nearly breaks Nicholas' jaw before he decides to just kill him. Nicholas, however, pleads for his life, making Glenn hesitate. Glenn repeatedly asks him to stop begging so killing him would be easier, but Nicholas does not listen. Glenn eventually spares Nicholas and helps him to his feet. The two wounded men head back for Alexandria.
Glenn first appears in this episode as a flashback. In a flashback Glenn and Nicholas show at the infirmary both bloody and bruised from their fight in the woods. Glenn is patched up by Rosita and Maggie asks him what happened. Glenn tells her that walkers attacked him and Nicholas in the woods and Glenn was accidentally hit by by a bullet that ricotched off of a tree and hit him in the shoulder. Glenn later appears at Rick's meeting where they discuss how to get rid of the walker herd in the quarry. Glenn tells Maggie that she should stay in Alexandria and watch over Deanna who is still devastated over the deaths of Aiden and Reg. Maggie tells Glenn that's not the only reason he wants her to stay and Glenn acknowledges this. Glenn notices Nicholas and looks at him in disapproval. Nicholas raises his hand and says he wants to help Rick with the plan as they are going to need all help he can get.
After Glenn sees this he offers to go too likely to watch Nicholas. Glenn later appears with he and Nicholas helping to build the wall to lure the walkers away. Glenn notices Maggie and Tara hugging which he smiles at. Glenn and Nicholas are later seen at the hardware store they are assigned at to clear out. Glenn tells Nicholas that he will be keeping a close eye on him from now on. Nicholas tells him he just wants to help which Glenn says he can.
In the present, Glenn is seen at the quarry when the truck holding one of the walkers on the opposite side of the quarry begins to fall Rick tells everyone to get ready and get into their positions. Glenn with Nicholas and Heath begin to head off to the hardware store that they have to clear. They arrive at the hardware store that they have to clear out so the walkers inside will not distract the herd they are trying to lure away. Glenn goes around to the side and sees a door. Glenn says they'll let a few walkers out at a time so they don't get overwhelmed. Heath isn't so sure on the plan, but Nicholas defends Glenn saying he knows what he is doing. Nicholas and Glenn begin to pry open the door but when they open it it's revealed that a shutter was keeping it closed.
They go to the front of the store and Glenn says that he and Heath will break the glass while Nicholas stays on the side. Nicholas says he wants to help but Glenn tells him to stay off to the side and if things go bad to go and radio Rick. Glenn shoots the glass and the walkers begin to pour out. Glenn manages his side of the walkers but Heath struggles and is being overwhelmed. Nicholas steps in and saves Heath and Nicholas asks Glenn if he can kill the last walker which Glenn approves of. Glenn, Nicholas and Heath run off into the woods. Glenn, Nicholas and Heath begin to travel back to Alexandria when they hear a loud horn coming from Alexandria.
Glenn, along with Rick, Michonne, and several Alexandrians, continue their trek through the woods back towards Alexandria, as the truck horn continues blaring, sending zombies in their direction. Unfortunately for his group, Barnes is killed by a zombie, Scott and Annie are injured, David is bitten, and Sturgess fled in fear. Rick deviates from the group and instructs Glenn to bring everyone back to Alexandria. Glenn and the others arrive in an abandoned town and start searching for cars. As the rest of the survivors rest in a pet store, Glenn and Nicholas look for an escape route, since Nicholas is familiar with the area. However, the herd of zombies catches up with them, trapping Nicholas and Glenn in an alleyway. With no way out, Nicholas chooses to commit suicide, causing Glenn to fall off the dumpster with Nicholas' corpse into the herd of zombies. The scene's cinematography implied that Glenn was being devoured.
The scene that suggested Glenn had died repeats at the beginning of the episode, and it is revealed that it was 
Nicholas
 who was devoured, as his body had fallen on top of Glenn, shielding him from the herd. Glenn shimmies his way under the dumpster, as the walkers disembowel Nicholas' corpse, and kills the walkers attempting to grab him with his knife, creating a barricade and masking his scent. Glenn hides until the walkers wander off the next day, then Enid appears on a nearby rooftop to toss him a bottle of water before running off. Glenn decides to pursue her in the building she is in, where he asks her why she is here and what happened in Alexandria. However, Enid leaves and as Glenn decides to continue pursuing her, his worry for Maggie has him go towards back to Alexandria instead.
As he continues his way there, he finds David who has reanimated after being killed by the herd and puts him down. Just then, before he climbs up the gate, he goes back for Enid and after a tense confrontation at an abandoned diner, they head back to Alexandria. As he and Enid head back, they find some green balloons and take them along as a signal.
They arrive finding the walls surrounded. Enid wants to flee, but Glenn encourages her not to give up. They later release a handful of helium-inflated balloons - signaling to the Alexandrians that they are alive.
Glenn is first seen with Enid watching in shock as the walls of Alexandria fall. Enid is pessimistic and tells Glenn, ""This is how it happens."" Glenn insists that as bad as it looks, there are people on the inside who care about her. He reveals that Maggie is pregnant, and tries to convince Enid that she is obligated to help rather than give up. He is later seen climbing a tree by one of the walls, spotting Maggie on the top of the lookout post.
Glenn and Enid search a church for supplies to rescue Maggie from the lookout tower. Enid opens up to Glenn about her dead parents, ""They're still here because you're still here,"" Glenn tells her, and then orders Enid to stay at the church while he rescues Maggie, but Enid refuses.
They find a gun inside of a box near the altar and piles of cloth that they can tie together to help Maggie climb off the platform. Enid rescues Maggie while Glenn distracts walkers away from the tower. Maggie cries out as walkers surround Glenn, Abraham and Sasha suddenly appear. Standing on top of the fuel truck, they’re able to gun down the walkers and save Glenn.
Safely inside the truck, Glenn proposes to Daryl that they use the vehicle to lead the walkers away, But Daryl suggests an alternate plan. As Daryl pours the fuel from the fuel truck into Alexandria's pond, Glenn, along with Sasha, Enid, Abraham and Maggie fend off the nearby walker. After Daryl shoots the RPG into the fuel-filled pond, it ignites the fuel and causing a massive fire to erupt, distracting the rest of the herd to head for it where Glenn and the rest kill off the herd for hours until the next morning. He is then among the survivors resting at the infirmary after the walker massacre.
Glenn assures her they'll be okay, They see Denise and Abraham running into the townhouse basement and sprint over to investigate. Rick, Michonne, Glenn, Maggie and Abraham board the motor home with Jesus. En route to the Hilltop, Abraham asks Glenn about Maggie's pregnancy and shares his skepticism over bringing a child into the world.
""We're trying to build something,"" Glenn explains. Harlan, introduces himself as a doctor. Glenn asks if he has any prenatal vitamins, and Harlan smiles, admitting he used to be an obstetrician, ""I'd say you two just hit the jackpot,"" he says. In his medical trailer, Harlan performs an ultrasound on Maggie, Glenn and Maggie smile when they see the fetus and hear its heartbeat.
Glenn circulates an ultrasound photo of the baby, Abraham gazes at the photo and smiles at Glenn.
Meanwhile, Maggie tells Glenn that she intends to go with them to the Saviors' compound because she was the one who enabled the deal with the Hilltop, but assures him she'll stay on the perimeter. At a meeting to coordinate the attack, Andy (from the Hilltop) draws a map of the interior and exterior of the Saviors' compound for Rick, Maggie, Daryl, Glenn, and Michonne.
He explains that the main building has one entrance guarded by two men, but that he is unsure of how many there are in total, Rick proposes they attack at night while everyone is asleep, He plans to walk right in through the front entrance, ""They want Gregory's head, right?"" he says, ""We're gonna give it to them,""
Later, in the woods, Glenn and Heath kill several walkers and share their anxiety about killing the Saviors, having never killed living people before. Glenn saws off a walker's head. In another room, Glenn and Heath discover two men asleep, and grimly prepare to kill them with their knives.
Glenn is able to overcome his nerves, and offers to kill the other for Heath as well, They find a trophy wall of Polaroid photos showing the bodies of Savior victims, all of whose heads have been crushed. When the Saviors hit the alarm Glenn, along with Heath manages to get to the armory full of weapons, then he and Heath empty their weapons at the door, killing the remaining Saviors. With the fighting over, Rick's group emerges from the building.
They find a small parking lot of vehicles, Glenn asks Heath to postpone his 2 week supply run with Tara, but Heath refuses, The two of them take an RV and leave immediately. However, after Daryl captures a surviving Savior, Glenn hears on the walkie-talkie that the Saviors have Maggie and Carol. Glenn then receives a look of distress and anger as his wife and unborn child are now in the hands of dangerous people.
Glenn is shown with the group in the beginning of the episode. He later appears at the end, where Maggie and Carol find Rick's group just outside the door, about to storm the building. As Maggie and Glenn reunite, Maggie tells Glenn, ""I can't anymore"".
Glenn and Maggie are showering together, when he notices bruises on her abdomen.
Outside, Glenn listens as Maggie suggests they create caches of guns throughout the community in the event of an attack. Upon noticing Daryl leave, Glenn and Michonne go after him, along with Rosita who claims to know where he's heading. Glenn looks back at Maggie in the van's mirror as he drives away.
Glenn, Michonne and Rosita arrive at the train tracks where Denise died. Glenn asks Rosita which way Dwight escaped, and she questions whether they should let Daryl go after him. Glenn argues that Daryl doesn't know what he's doing and will get himself killed. Rosita points in the direction Dwight went and they carry on.
Glenn, Michonne and Rosita find Daryl in the woods. Glenn tries to stop Daryl from going after Dwight, but Daryl refuses. Rosita goes with him, and Glenn and Michonne reluctantly turn back. Glenn tells Michonne the world is a lot bigger than they thought it was. Just then, they hear whistling and realize they are surrounded by Dwight and his men.
Glenn and Michonne are captured and held at a camp, tied up and gagged. Glenn notices Daryl approaching and tries to warn him off, but Dwight is able to sneak up behind Daryl and shoot him.
Glenn is pulled from the van and put on his knees with the others, concerned to see Maggie's health has deteriorated. As 
Negan Smith
 is trying to decide who to kill, he looks at Maggie and suggests putting her out of her misery. Glenn dives forward but is subdued by Dwight as he begs Negan not to hurt her. He is put back in line and seen as Negan uses 'Eenie, Meenie, Minie, Moe' to select his victim. Glenn watches as Abraham is chosen as Negan's victim and killed.
After Negan kills Abraham, Negan starts taunting 
Rosita
 with his bloody bat. Daryl suddenly stands up for her and punches Negan for his actions. This causes Negan to make good on his promise to ""shut that shit down, no exceptions,"" and brutally beats Glenn to death with his baseball bat as everyone watches, horrified. After taking two brutal blows to the head, a grievously injured Glenn looks at Maggie. He is a bloody mess; bleeding profusely from his slightly dented head and left eye almost bulging out of its socket. Glenn attempts to speak his final words to a horrified and crying Maggie. Negan, seeing this, holds off for a moment to hear what Glenn has to say, expressing admiration for his perseverance. After a few moments, Glenn utters his heart-breaking final words, ""Maggie, I'll -- I'll find you.""
Negan pauses to offer sympathy to the group on how hard this is to watch. But he then reminds them ""No exceptions!"" as he swings Lucille across Glenn's face without hesitation, causing Glenn to crash to the ground. Negan continues savagely beating Glenn's head, shattering his entire skull to pieces, and then into a bloody mush. Glenn's graphic and mangled corpse lies in a large pool of bloody brain matter, bone, and an eyeball. Glenn's hand twitches.
Later that day, the Saviors leave the survivors to grieve; Glenn's remains are photographed by one Savior. Glenn's corpse is then taken away by the survivors for burial.
As the survivors load their dead into the vehicles, Rick envisions an idyllic scene in which the Alexandrian residents eat dinner together, with Glenn and the recently killed Abraham among the group - a future made impossible by Negan - after Negan's taunts play back through his mind. Glenn is seen holding his and Maggie's son in his lap.
Dwight leaves a picture of Glenn's corpse in Daryl's cell to torment him. Daryl breaks down in tears at the sight of it.
