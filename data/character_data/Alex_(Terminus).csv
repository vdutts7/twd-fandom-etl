,,,"Alex outwardly puts on an approachable and friendly appearance. When the group arrives at 
Terminus

Rick
 immediately realizes something is off and holds Alex at gunpoint. It's eventually revealed that Alex and the rest of his group are all cannibals. Through flashbacks, it's revealed that Alex was once a good person and that Terminus was genuinely supposed to be a sanctuary until they were attacked by a 
rapist group
. Alex is shown to regret this choice, questioning why they put up the signs.
Strangely, 
Gareth
 gives little reaction to Alex's death, suggesting they weren't all that close. It's even revealed that after his death, they were going to use Alex's body as food.
