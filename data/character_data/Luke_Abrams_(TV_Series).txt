Overview
[
]


Luke is a fatigued survivor who understands there is safety in numbers. He values what is beautiful and hopeful and makes people uniquely human. He’s more on the artist’s spectrum of personality, preaching the love of music as a necessity to maintain humanity during chaotic times. Among his group, he is the most jovial and friendly. As he and his group are interviewed, he is shown to be quite humble, believing he's not sure what he did to deserve to still be alive, saying he just got lucky. He acts as a voice of reason for the group, convincing 
Magna
 to not attack 
Alexandria
, reasoning that they have kids.

As a music teacher, Luke is shown to be very knowledgeable and intelligent. He cherishes his instruments and the history behind them, something his group often teases him about. At one point, 
Michonne
 sees Luke holding something and believes it to be a weapon. However, it's actually revealed to be a Stradivarius, which Michonne slices in half, something Luke becomes distraught over. Luke quickly forgives Michonne for this act. 

Unlike many who have become hardened survivors, Luke is very upbeat and optimistic, something quite rare this far into the apocalypse. As his group discusses whether they should join Michonne's group or take their chances on their own, Luke is the most vocal on joining believing in strength in numbers. Luke quickly becomes an accepted member of the group, volunteering to join a search party. Luke is very humorous, personable, and witty when interacting with others. He forms a friendship with 
Alden
 with the two bonding over music. Later, Luke manages to convince Alden to sing at the fair.

In 
Season 10
, Luke becomes a member of the 
Coalition
, helping whenever he is needed. He develops feelings for 
Jules
, an 
Oceanside
 resident. He greatly care for her well-being, joining Michonne on her trip to Oceanside to see if she's okay after 
Whisperer
 activity is spotted. He still retains his optimistic nature, defending 
Virgil
, since he had saved his life earlier and has photos of his family. Though Luke generally is shown to not be the most combat-proficient, Luke's intelligence helps take out 
Alpha
's mega 
herd
. Using music to lure the walkers off a cliff, his plan ends up being successful.

At some point after the outbreak, Luke met girlfriends 
Magna
 and 
Yumiko
, siblings 
Connie

Kelly
, 
Bernie
 among other survivors. The group survived for several years, eventually becoming closer and seeing each other as family. However, as the years went by, several members of the group died.

Jones Springs
 and 
Coalport
, both which eventually fell causing the group's distrust in rejoining any other similar settlements.

"
What Comes After
"


In the woods, 
Magna
's 
group
 take on a 
herd
 of 
walkers
. They quickly get overwhelmed but they get saved when the walkers around them get shot from the trees. 

Luke and the group escape into the woods to find a 9 year old girl who asks for their names. They introduce themselves and ask what her name is. The girl picks up her 
hat
 and introduces herself as 
Judith Grimes
.



"
Who Are You Now?
"


In the woods, Luke and the group follow Judith as she leads them to 
Rosita
, 
Eugene
, 
Laura
 and 
Aaron
. Luke jokingly comments to Eugene that he can help him cook the rabbit. Wanting to take them in, Judith declares she won't return to 
Alexandria
 until they accept them. The others reluctantly agree. 

Later, Luke and the group arrive at Alexandria's gates and Judith assures them they'll be safe. They get escorted inside, where 
Gracie
 runs over to Aaron. Rosita updates 
Siddiq
 on 
Yumiko
's condition and he escorts her to the infirmary. Magna tries to tag along but is stopped by 
D.J.


Michonne
 arrives on horseback and doesn't look pleased to see the new arrivals. She frisks Magna and asks Eugene why they're here. Aaron claims it was his call but Michonne reminds him it's not his call to make. 
"I decided,"
 Judith tells her. Michonne scolds her but Aaron says they're here now and they should decide their fate together, while 
Gabriel
 suggests they vote tomorrow. Michonne agrees and instructs her people to put them in holding.

The next day, Luke and the group stand before the Alexandria council for questioning. They ask who their leader is and Magna claims they're a team, while Luke explains their group used to be bigger and that they just lost their friend, 
Bernie
. Gabriel asks about their former professions. Luke was a music teacher, Magna was a truck stop waitress, 
Connie
 was a journalist and 
Kelly
 was a high school student. Luke says they should trust them, but Michonne isn't done with questions. She stands up and asks Magna to see her left hand, which has a prison tattoo. Michonne then calls her out for the hidden knife on her belt, which she puts on the table. Michonne storms out, saying she'll second any of their motions. Magna tries to question her but is shut off.

Later, in the infirmary, Siddiq updates Luke and the rest on Yumiko's condition. He asks him if he has been there since the start but Siddiq confesses that he was also found in the 
woods
, but things were different in the 
past
.

At night, Luke and the rest scold Magna for ruining their chance to stay. Luke asks Magna to hand over her necklace, which also doubles as a knife, but she's reluctant. Magna says they should fight their way through Alexandria to take their supplies before heading out, but Connie tells her to leave Michonne and Judith out of it. Luke says they save the fighting for people who deserve it, and Magna finally surrenders the necklace.

The next day, Luke and the group prepares to leave by thanking everyone for their hospitality. Michonne rides up and says she's going to instead escort them to 
Hilltop
 with Siddiq. 



"
Stradivarius
"


On the road to Hilltop, Siddiq tells Michonne she should have let Magna's group stay in Alexandria, but she says she still doesn't trust them and is only doing this for her daughter. In the cart, Magna complains to her group that Michonne has her knives and she wants them back. Yumiko tells Michonne she's just upset about their lost friend, Bernie.

A while later, Michonne and the others arrive at Magna's giant crate of supplies, which have been displaced and destroyed by walkers. Magna's upset at the sight of Bernie's things while Michonne instructs D.J. to gather more of their weapons. This angers them, and Michonne also announces she's returning to Alexandria in the morning while Siddiq and D.J. help them finish the journey. Magna and Luke start to get riled up, but Yumiko calms them down and reluctantly agrees to her terms. They decide to find shelter for the night.

At night, inside a factory, Michonne hears a noise and finds Luke holding something. She thinks it's a weapon and tells him to drop it and turn around. Luke turns only for Michonne to slice his Stradivarius in half, waking up the rest of the group.

Luke gawks at his broken Stradivarius in disbelief and explains to Michonne how old and rare it was. Yumiko lays her head on Magna's leg and playfully recalls the mansion they found it in. Luke says the Stradivarius is the one thing that separates them from the animals and how it brought humans together in the past, leaving Michonne in thought.

In the morning, Siddiq tries again to convince Michonne to come with them but she says she can't take the risk with 
Maggie
. Siddiq reveals to her that Maggie and Hershel left last fall, shocking her. Before he can explain, D.J. arrives to let them know that there are walkers outside. The group gets out to find several walkers blocking the path to their horses.

Michonne kills several walkers as Magna demands they get back their weapons. Michonne finally relents and orders D.J. to return them their weapons. As Magna's group splits up and take out several walkers, an undead Bernie appears, deeply upsetting them. A heartbroken Magna can't put him down, so Michonne does it for her. The group opens a clear path and leave.

On the road, Michonne empathizes with Yumiko and Magna, saying that she understands their pain of losing a friend considered family. Suddenly, two Hilltop soldiers ride up to them to inform that Rosita's injured and being cared for at Hilltop. Michonne instructs them to tell Hilltop they're on their way. Connie notices something nearby, confusing the group, but tells them it's nothing. As they leave, someone watches them from the bushes. 



"
Evolution
"


At Hilltop, everyone runs inside as Michonne and Siddiq arrive with Magna and her group. From the guard post, Dianne makes them all surrender their weapons before entering.

Inside, Tara coldly greets Michonne and updates her on Eugene, Aaron, 
Daryl
, and Rosita's situations. She then informs Luke and the rest of the group that they'll have to wait for Jesus to return before deciding on their future, but they can stay until he gets back. Connie thanks her for everyone.



"
Adaptation
"


In Hilltop, Luke contemplates the community and then goes over to talk with Tara and others who are organizing a search party to look for the rest since they haven't come back. Luke offers his help and goes out with 
Alden
.

In the woods, Luke and Alden bond over music until they discover one of Yumiko's arrows on a tree. They kill some walkers and Luke suggests they follow the arrows to find their friends. They spot a herd nearby and ponder their new moves.

Later, Luke and Alden spot a walker staring at them motionless. Suddenly, they get surrounded by several Whisperers and the 
leader
 tosses them one of the arrows they've been following, points a shotgun at them, and says, 
"Trail ends here."




"
Bounty
"


At Hilltop, Alpha orders a couple of whisperers to bring up a tied up Luke and Alden. Alpha offers to Daryl to trade both of them for her daughter or she will kill them.

Meanwhile, a herd arrives and Alpha instructs her people to draw them away. Suddenly, a Whisperer's baby starts crying, which attracts the walkers over. Alpha shrugs at the mother, indicating she should leave the baby to die. Luke and Alden scream for them not to but Alpha explains it's natural selection. He then frantically signs Connie to grab the baby and watches as she runs out of the cornfield, sling-shots a walker, and grabs it.

Later, Daryl hands 
Lydia
 over to Alpha in exchange for Luke and Alden. Yumiko hugs Luke and gets him inside, where he is embraced by the rest of his group.

At night, Luke drinks and celebrates his safety alongside his companions.



"
The Calm Before
"


In the Kingdom, Luke and a group gear up to go look for Connie as the fair starts. Suddenly, Daryl, Michonne, and the convoy arrives. Luke and his group are happy to see Connie and hug her. A while later, Luke says goodbye to Yumiko and Magna as they prepare to leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. 

At the fair, Luke tries convincing Alden to perform with him despite losing a bet. 
Enid
 accidentally calls Alden her boyfriend, but he decides that it's okay and accepts to sing. Luke calls them a cute couple as they leave. Later that day, Luke sings along with Alden in their concert.

The next day, Luke listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news regarding the fate of the missing residents from the fair, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.

"
Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Luke and the Coalition form a militia in order to train the several residents of the communities to face any future treats. He takes part in a training exercise on the Oceanside beach. As Ezekiel and Jerry methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Luke and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat. Later on, Luke meets 
Jules
 at the camp and flirts with her while they move some ropes.

After a Whisperer mask is discovered on the Oceanside beach, Luke and Alden head out to investigate any other possible Whisperer sighting around the area. When Yumiko radios the group to inform they have found something, Luke catches up to the others in the woods where they have found an abandoned campsite full of corpses and a walker skin. Aaron declares one of the Whisperers has been here.

That night, Luke and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. The group runs out of water as a herd of walkers approaches the group. With their backs to the fire, the group prepares for a fight.

Luke and the group take their formations and start fighting off the herd. As they keep killing the walkers, Daryl tosses an axe to cut a tree down and have it fall onto some walkers. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers. When Eugene asks for help scraping the fallen satellite for any valuable part, Luke discourages him because of radiation but he insists they are already surrounded by radiation and are infected with something that turns them into walkers when they die.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Luke is alerted to the commotion of a tree falling onto a house and a portion of Hilltop's walls. He wonders if the Whisperers are responsible, causing his companions to debate. He then helps the other residents rescue the trapped injured from the rubble. The next day, the residents realize that a small herd has arrived outside the community walls. Luke and a group head outside to fight them off.

That night, Luke and the other residents kill the incoming walkers with the help of the Alexandria convoy when the herd invades the community. The following morning, Luke attends the council meeting where Michonne announces she will be delivering supplies to Oceanside after receiving reports of potential Whisperer activity. He immediately volunteers to go with the group so he can check on Jules much to his companions' friendly comments.

Later that day, Luke hugs his friends goodbye and waves to the other residents around the community as the group prepares their convoy and head out on their journey towards Oceanside.



"
The World Before
"


Luke and the group continue their journey towards Oceanside when they stop briefly after Scott comes across recent footprints on their path. When Michonne tells the group they have to remain quiet, he sarcastically remarks that he knows that was meant to him and claims he is going as a representative of Hilltop, but Judith jokes that he actually wants to see Jules. Luke then explains to her that he was whistling one of his favorite songs and writes it down for her in a book where she is documenting everything that happens to them for the future.  

Shortly after, Luke convinces Michonne to stop at a nearby library along the way to look for more books. When the group heads inside, Judith gives him a Russian-English dictionary for Eugene to understand the satellite parts before he heads to the music section. He finds a musical book when suddenly he is attacked by two walkers. While struggling, a man saves his life before fleeing to Luke's confusion. The group arrives after hearing his screams and Luke tells them about the man who saved him. He is then informed by Michonne about 
Siddiq
's death. 

Later that day, the group arrives at Oceanside where Luke witnesses as the residents bring the man that saved him to the camp and accuse him of being a Whisperer. While Michonne demands answers, Luke defends him for saving him earlier that day and for having photos of his family in the backpack he had left behind at the library. When walkers suddenly invade, he helps take out the threat and secure the community. The next day, Luke tells Michonne that Judith will take care of them after she explains her plan to bring back weapons in exchange for helping 
Virgil
 get back home. He then bids her farewell before he and the rest of the group travel back to their communities.



"
Morning Star
"


Back at the Hilltop, Kelly wishes to join Luke's search party in an attempt to rescue her sister, while Luke cautions her against it, as her ankle is injured. Yumiko asks Kelly about Magna's last words to her, but the latter thinks them unimportant, since she believes they will rescue their friends. Annoyed at Yumiko's questioning, Kelly asks why she is coming with them if she thinks Magna and Connie are dead. They are interrupted by Daryl and Lydia's arrival. The pair reveal that Alpha is coming.

The caravan returns to the Hilltop, with Daryl informing the others of the situation. Luke suggests calling Alexandria for reinforcements, but Dianne thinks that neither Alexandria nor Oceanside can get to them in time. Earl is confident that Hilltop is prepared, and tries to rally everyone for the upcoming conflict.

Outside, Luke and Kelly are rigging the defenses when Yumiko joins them and apologizes to Kelly for being "an asshole". Kelly quickly forgives her with a hug, and is confident they will get Connie and Magna back "cause assholes get shit done". They are suddenly interrupted by dozens of rats fleeing from the bushes. Yumiko quickly realizes that the horde is coming, and orders everyone to prepare.



"
Walk With Us
"


Luke survives the destruction of Hilltop but is left injured and unconscious. 
Aaron
 drags his friend to safety in the nearby forest on a makeshift metal shed before encountering 
Negan
 who attempts to convince Aaron he means him no harm, though Aaron refuses to listen. With walkers approaching, Aaron is forced to defend the still-unconscious Luke while Negan gets away.



"
The Tower
"


After being carried away safely by Aaron, Luke is among the Hilltoppers to relocate to the abandoned hospital known as "
the Tower
". Having come up with a plan to destroy the Whisperer horde, Luke is seen fiddling around with some wires, stressed that everybody is counting on him, while Jules encourages him. Luke then announces that he needs someone to run an errand for him, for which Carol volunteers.



"
A Certain Doom
"


With 
the Whisperers
 and their massive 
herd
 surrounding 
the Tower
, 
Gabriel
 addresses the assembled 
Coalition
 members, stating that their plan to lead the herd away is still the same, only they will be leading them away from the Tower instead of 
Oceanside
. Once the walkers are clear, they will evacuate to Rendezvous Point B. Gabriel asks if Luke is ready and sitting before his equipment, Luke states that he has the final pieces they need to connect to the wagon and gives 
Carol
 a thumbs up in thanks for obtaining them, "but in order for it do the Pied Piper thing we need it to do over the cliff," they need to get from A to B and Luke has to "plug and plug" and then they will be good to go. However, 
Magna
 and 
Jerry
 point out that the wagon is on the other side of the horde and someone must go through it with Whisperers to deal with as well.

Gabriel decides to send four groups with two in each, one carrying the cargo while the other protects. Gabriel reminds everyone that it is crucial that all of the equipment makes it through to the wagon. 
Lydia
 offers to help them make it through, but 
Beatrice
 and 
Rachel
 refuse out of distrust for Lydia. Instead, Gabriel assigns her to help the archers covering them from the inside. Daryl acknowledges that not everyone will make it, but points out that this is the only way and everyone agrees to the plan.

Daryl, Carol, Beatrice, 
Kelly
, Magna, Jerry, Luke and 
Jules
 smear each other in walker guts in order to blend in with the herd and make it through. As Luke helps Jules to disguise herself, the two flirt with each other. Once they are ready, the group allows part of the horde into the hospital and, unnoticed due to the walker guts, are able to exit and begin passing through the horde to the other side. As they walk, a visibly-afraid Luke and Jules hold hands with each other. Luke, Jules, Magna and Jerry manage to make into the woods on the other side, but with no sign of the others, Jules worries aloud to Luke that they might be the only ones to have made it. However, seconds later, they are joined by Daryl and Kelly and a few minutes later by Carol and Lydia, Beatrice having fallen to a Whisperer and the horde.

Reaching the wagon, Luke puts together his makeshift sound system and the group, joined by 
Oscar
 and 
Marco
, start loudly playing "Burning Down the House," using the loud music and the wagon to pull the horde away from the Tower. Luke acts as one of the archers escorting the wagon, at one point bouncing along to the music. At nighttime, the Whisperers launch an attack on the wagon, using walkers as human shields as the Coalition archers try to take them out. Before being killed by Daryl, one of the Whisperers throws a chain that takes off the wagon's front left wheel and the group is forced to retreat into the woods as the Whisperers destroy the sound system.

With the horde turning back towards the Tower, Daryl warns Gabriel that they have lost the wagon and the others have walkers coming right back at them. Luke points out that the others should've evacuated by now with Jerry stating that the others are unprotected and they need to turn the horde around. Daryl suggests going back into the horde and hunting down the Whisperers one by one while Lydia offers to lead the horde away, having been taught how to by 
Alpha
. Daryl and Luke object to Lydia's plan with Luke pointing out that without the wagon to lead the walkers over the cliff, its a suicide mission. Deciding to deal with that later, Daryl leads Marco, Carol, Luke, Jules, Magna, Jerry, Kelly and Lydia into the horde where they stealthily assassinate all of the Whisperers while Daryl and 
Negan
 take out 
Beta
, allowing Lydia to lead the horde away and complete Luke's plan.

The next day, Luke and Jules are sitting together at the rendezvous point when Carol and Lydia return. The two women confirm that the horde has been destroyed and Luke thanks everyone and hugs Jules, stating that he can't believe that they pulled it off.

Following the Whisperer war, Luke went to live at Oceanside with Jules. Later however, a hostile group called the 
Commonwealth
 took over under 
Lance Hornsby
's orders.



"
Faith
"


In the woods, 
Lydia
 puts down a walker with her knife against the objections of 
Elijah
 who is worried that it could've been one of the climber variants. Although 
Jerry
 makes a joke about it, 
Aaron
 warns the others that they all need to stay alert as they don't know if their 
encounter
 with a climber was a one-time thing or not and there might be more of them out here. Aaron notices footsteps nearby, but Lydia recognizes them as being human, not walker. Aaron's group readies themselves to defend against possible threats, but Luke and 
Jules
 emerge from the trees instead. The friends are happily reunited with each other while Aaron introduces Luke and Jules to Elijah whom they have yet to meet. Jerry invites the two to join them in journeying to 
Oceanside
, but Luke explains that 
"it's gone, man. It ain't ours anymore. These guys in white gear 
showed up
 and... said they were from the Commonwealth"
 with Jules adding that they had just taken over. Aaron is surprised as they had 
made a deal
 with the Commonwealth, but Luke tells him that something must've changed as the Commonwealth Army is tracking him and Jules right now and they're dead if they're found. Luke suggests getting far away from Oceanside as humanly possible which Aaron agrees with. Shocked by the news, everyone begins moving out.

Aaron's group puts down several walkers and Luke and Jules explain that they were out scavenging and thus they weren't present when 
Lance Hornsby
's men arrived at Oceanside. They were hiding behind the houses trying to figure out what the hell to do with Luke wanting to stay and fight. However, 
Rachel
 wasn't having it and she insisted that they had to go, warn everybody and tell them what was coming which is why Luke and Jules had left in the end. Luke and Jules haven't seen Rachel or any of the others since and Luke feels guilty that they didn't stay and fight. Jerry and Aaron reassure them that they've got the group and everyone else now who are heading for Alexandria right now. Luke asks if that includes his old 
group
 which Aaron confirms. Hearing the sound of engines nearby, everyone quickly hides behind the wagon. Lydia and Elijah realize that the soldiers are closing in and that they can't outrun them. Spotting a 
herd
 moving nearby, Lydia looks at one of the dead walkers and gets an idea.

That night, Aaron's group, 
covered in walker guts
, moves with the massive herd, Lydia whispering directions to the others to move east. Two Commonwealth jeeps drive up and begins leading the herd in another direction, forcing Aaron, Lydia, Elijah, Jerry, Luke and Jules to follow them in order to maintain their cover. Lydia is bumped into by a walker, causing her to drop her knife which is then picked up by a variant walker that's amongst the herd.



"
Family
"


In the woods, a Commonwealth jeep leads a large 
herd
, amongst them 
Aaron
, 
Lydia
, 
Elijah
, 
Jerry
, Luke, and 
Jules
, 
covered in walker guts
. Spotting a break ahead to the right, Aaron whispers the message that it's now their chance with the others planning to make a break for the trees. However, as the group begins to make their break for it, a soldier pulls up on a motorcycle, leading a second herd in from the side that joins up with the massive herd that the jeep is leading, trapping Aaron's group amongst the walkers once more. From the other side, a third herd is brought in by another motorcycle, resulting in a massive herd of thousands of walkers having been corralled together by two Commonwealth jeeps and two motorcycles. Having completed their mission, the soldiers drive off, leaving the herd heading towards 
the Commonwealth
 itself which is just miles away.

As they continue, Aaron spots an abandoned RV up ahead and directs the others towards it. Putting down a walker in the RV, Aaron, Jerry and Lydia manage to get inside, but Jules gets swept away by the herd and Luke goes after his girlfriend. Trying to enter the RV, Elijah gets caught in the herd and as Lydia desperately tries to hang on to her boyfriend's hand, she is bitten in the left arm by a walker before Aaron and Jerry pull her into the RV as Elijah gets swept away as well. As the herd continues on towards the Commonwealth, a number of walkers begin banging on the RV's door, trying to get at the survivors within.

The Coalition
 races through the streets towards the 
hospital
 with 
Daryl
 carrying the unconscious 
Judith
. Commonwealth vehicles drive up and block their path in multiple directions, forcing them to fall back. 
Carol
 realizes that the soldiers aren't following them as they begin to erect barricades in the streets. Loudly yelling and firing their guns in the air, Commonwealth soldiers lead the herd in their direction before closing the barricades, penning the herd and the Coalition in. Spotting a walker climbing over something, a shocked 
Negan
 asks 
"what the fuck?"
 As walkers close in from multiple directions, Luke and Jules emerge from the herd, causing 
Kelly
 to nearly shoot them before 
Connie
 stops her sister. Fleeing down a side street, Carol spots an alley near part of the herd and everyone attacks the walkers, clearing a path for Daryl to flee down the alley towards the hospital with Judith. Waking up for a moment, Judith calls out 
"
daddy
?"
 and witnesses her friends and loved ones struggling to hold back the herd before passing out again.



"
Rest in Peace
"


In the streets, the 
Coalition
 desperately fights off the 
herd
 as they try to escape from the walkers swarming around them, those armed with guns shooting the undead while the rest stab at them with knives, including 
Max
. However, 
Jules
 misses the head of one walker, instead stabbing it in the shoulder. The walker bites Jules in the arm and Luke rushes to his girlfriend's aid, stabbing the walker in the head and yelling for help as he supports Jules. However, walkers swarm the couple from behind with one tackling Luke to the ground and biting him in the leg as Jules is dragged down and devoured. Seeing Luke's predicament, 
Connie
 shoots the walker in the head and Luke is dragged to safety by 
Kelly
 and 
Yumiko
, yelling in desperation for his girlfriend as Jules is devoured, beyond the ability of any of her friends to try to save her. Shooting at a smaller group of walkers coming down an alleyway, 
Carol
 orders her friends to follow her down it and everyone flees as the herd overruns the streets.

At 
the hospital
, 
Magna's group
 desperately tries to save Luke's life, having 
amputated
 his bitten leg. Near death from the bite and blood loss, Luke has his friends remove a harmonica that he's kept from his pocket and Yumiko promises him that they'll keep the music alive for him. With his last words, Luke asks everyone to promise him, and they all do so. Luke dies in his friends' arms as they all sob at losing him. Taking a knife from Kelly, 
Magna
 stabs Luke in the head to prevent him from reanimating and the group sobs over his corpse. Magna, Yumiko, Kelly and Connie cover Luke's body with a sheet, but they are forced to leave it behind as the herd overruns the hospital.

One year later, Luke's name is on a plaque beside Jules, 
Rosita
, and 
Marissa Berot
, as part of a memorial dedicated to those who lost their lives when the herd overran the city. 
Eugene
 visits the plaque while attending
