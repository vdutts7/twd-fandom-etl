Overview
[
]


Though Mike's true personality is unknown, through 
Michonne
's dream sequence he seems to be a friendly, humorous, and caring man. He and Michonne had a very close relationship and he is shown to greatly care for his son's safety. However, it's revealed that Mike is quite careless. He and 
Terry
 had gotten high and were unable to save Andre or themselves. Michonne harbored resent towards Mike for this and kept him as a walker as punishment. Her disdain for him is so great that she states that he and Terry, 
"weren't human to begin with."
 However, later Michonne does state that she missed Mike very much.



Pre-Apocalypse
[

Atlanta, Georgia
[
]


Little¬†is known about Mike's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was Michonne's boyfriend and had a son named 
Andre
, and they lived in an apartment building in Atlanta. He was also friends with 
Terry
.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Shortly after the 
outbreak
, Mike joined a refugee camp with Michonne, Andre, and Terry. Michonne became a prominent supply runner and defender of the camp, using a 
katana
 she had found. However, Mike and Terry became hopeless about their situation, especially as conditions at the camp worsened. Terry suggested they leave the camp, but Mike rejects this idea as he sees it as suicide. Unable to cope with this new world, Mike and Terry get high on drugs. Meanwhile, the camp was attacked and overrun by walkers - with Andre getting devoured and Mike and Terry bitten. Michonne returned from her supply run and saw what became of her family. Out of both anger and unwillingness to let go of her loved ones, Michonne let Mike and Terry turn. She then cut off their arms and jaws so they were unable to attack her, and she used them as both pet mules and camouflage against the other undead.

Seed
"


After Michonne comes back from her supply run for medicine, she enters the local game cooler where Michonne, Andrea and a reanimated Mike and Terry have been taking refuge in. Mike and Terry are standing near the entrance chained together. After Michonne and Andrea decide to advance to the next location, Mike and Terry exit at the back, being pulled by Michonne, carrying their weapons and supplies.



"
Walk With Me
"


After a helicopter crashes, Andrea and Michonne go to investigate it. Michonne chains the reanimated Mike and Terry to a tree. A group of armed men arrive, and Michonne and Andrea hide in the bushes to watch them. Mike and Terry¬†begin to make too much noise, and Michonne decapitates them to prevent their location being compromised leaving their reanimated heads on the ground.

The reanimated heads of Mike and Terry are¬†later are being experimented on by 
Milton Mamet
 in his laboratory. Milton tells him about Michonne's walkers, about how they had starved and were being used as camouflage. 
The Governor
 tests Milton's theory and rests two of his fingers in Mike's decapitated mouth.



"
Made to Suffer
"


After Michonne breaks off from the group and sneaks into 
the Governor's apartment
 waiting to kill him, she hears a rustling and discovers an 
aquarium
 full of decapitated walker heads including Mike's zombified head.



"
Prey
"


The episode opens with a flashback to when Michonne and Andrea were camping in the winter. As the two eat, Andrea asks about her pet walkers, Mike and Terry.
