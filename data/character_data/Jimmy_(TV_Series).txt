Overview
[
]


While having limited on-screen interactions, Jimmy is shown to be a helpful, kind, and caring individual that has been shown or implied to be on positive terms with almost everyone on the 
Greene Family Farm
 and with the 
Atlanta camp survivors
.

He has also been shown or viewed to be immature to some extent, notably by 
Hershel
 and 
Lori
. One such example being the way he was holding his gun like a gangster during target practice, presumably from listening to rap music. This trait was likely how he got along with 
Carl
 the way he did.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


Georgia
[
]


Jimmy was born in 1993. Before the outbreak, Jimmy and Beth attended school together. They eventually began a casual relationship and dated for three months. Whenever Jimmy and Beth were around each other, Hershel would always keep an eye on them, particularly due to their immaturity as young people and his fear of their sexual activity.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


Greene Family Farm
[
]


After the apocalypse unfolded, Jimmy was taken in by the Greene family to live on the farm and treated as one of Hershel's own children.



Season 2
[
]


"
Bloodletting
"
[
]


When 
Maggie
 witnesses a man running toward their property, she calls everyone out to the porch. Jimmy comes outside holding a baseball bat. When 
Rick
 explains that his son 
Carl
 had been shot by Otis, Jimmy holds Beth's hand and approaches him. He and his girlfriend Beth watch as 
Hershel
 attempt to save Carl's life. Later, he can be seen with Beth while Otis goes to his wife.



"
Cherokee Rose
"
[
]


Jimmy is first seen gathering rocks for 
Otis
' funeral, and then attending it. He is present when the rest of Rick's group return to the farm. He, along with the others, placed a rock on the grave in appreciation for what Otis had done for his entire life and what he did right before his death (according to 
Shane
).



"
Chupacabra
"
[
]


When Jimmy finds out the men were heading out again into the woods to continue their search for 
Sophia
, he wishes to join the group and assist in looking for her, claiming that he knows the surrounding area pretty well. 
Rick
 asks Jimmy if Hershel was alright with the idea, to which he replied, "yes" (however, later it turns out he never asked). Daryl starts talking about the time he was squirrel hunting and saw a chupacabra, and Jimmy laughs and finds it funny why Daryl would believe such a thing. He then attempted to pick up a rifle on the hood of a car, but Rick stopped him and asked if he had any practice using a gun before. Jimmy insisted that if he went out on runs he would want a gun. Jimmy starts to walk off but Shane suggests he can teach him how to use a gun properly. 
Andrea
 suggests that he can accompany her and 
T-Dog
 to look for Sophia in the meantime. Later, he runs out of the farmhouse with the others when the group hears gunfire (Andrea shooting Daryl). Afterward, Jimmy joins the group for dinner and sits at the small table with Beth, Maggie, and 
Glenn
.



"
Secrets
"
[
]


Jimmy is with Rick and Shane talking about locations that they could look for Sophia. Rick asks Jimmy about a certain location and Jimmy explains that it was a housing development that Shane and Andrea would later visit. He thanks Glenn when he comes by to give them apples. Beth and Patricia then walk up, wanting to take part in gun training. Jimmy stands there quietly as the two girls talk to Rick and Shane walks off to have a conversation with Carl. Jimmy and the others then all go to the shooting range, He drives Otis's truck accompanied by Beth and 
Patricia
. While there, Jimmy slowly becomes a better shot. Jimmy at the range holds the gun on the side and tries to shoot like a gangster, but T-Dog tells him to stop, and Jimmy holds his gun normally, fires it and knocks down one of the bottled targets.



"
Pretty Much Dead Already
"
[
]


Jimmy notices in the creek that two walkers, 
Louise Bush
 and 
Doug
, are trapped in the mud. He alerts Hershel and himself, Hershel, and Rick go out to the creek to capture them. Hershel shows Rick how to free the walkers from the mud, and Jimmy and Rick try freeing Doug. During the struggle to free Doug, Jimmy tells Rick that Otis told him that if you get them half way out they'll do the rest of the work. Both Jimmy and Rick after freeing Doug trip over themselves and fall into the mud. Jimmy is nearly bitten by Doug but he quickly gets up to spot for Hershel and Rick. After leading them back to the barn, Shane starts to lose his temper, and he lets out all the walkers from the barn. Soon the group begins to kill all of the walkers in the barn. Jimmy watches in disappointment as all his zombified friends and neighbors are shot, and when Beth starts to cry, he embraces her.



"
Nebraska
"
[
]


Jimmy is seen with Beth after the barn shooting and holds her as she cried. When Hershel, Maggie, Beth, and Patricia walk back to the house, Jimmy remains at the barn and helps the others dig graves for 
Sophia
, 
Annette
, and 
Shawn
. He is later seen alongside everyone at their funeral. Later, he is seen checking up on Beth with Maggie, Patricia, and Andrea after she went into a coma, and gives Andrea a worried look.



"

[
]


Jimmy is seen in Hershel's house, preparing dinner and handing out silverware, before noticing that 
Lori
 was missing, and is later seen when Hershel, Rick, and Glenn arrive back at the farm. He shows interested in the 
prisoner
 Rick brought back with him, but Patricia got him to go back inside. He was later present when the group was deciding what to do with the boy.



"
Judge, Jury, Executioner
"
[
]


Jimmy is seen in the background with Patricia tending to the cattle along with Hershel. When the group was discussing the fate of Randall, he was not present as he was watching Carl at that time. He was also not present after 
Dale
 had his stomach ripped open by a walker, and was most likely watching over Beth.



"
Better Angels
"
[
]


Jimmy is briefly seen attending Dale's funeral and later boarding up the windows of Hershel's home and helping the Atlanta group move things in to the farmhouse. At the end of the episode, he is seen investigating the barn after Randall was set free by Shane, and ran back to the farmhouse with the others for safety.



"
Beside the Dying Fire
"
[
]


Jimmy is seen waiting in the farmhouse for Rick and Shane to get back. When the group notices walkers coming toward the farmhouse, Jimmy took a gun and goes inside Dale's RV and begins shooting many walkers. Later, Daryl drives up on his motorcycle and alerted him to Rick and Carl being in the barn. He parked the RV alongside the barn so they could jump on. After they jump on the top of the RV, zombies force their way into the RV and devour him. His body along with the RV is engulfed in flames, stopping him from reanimating.
