He offers to play video games with Carl to help him adjust to his new life. Ron suggests to Carl that they head to Mikey's house and play with the pool table but warns that Mikey's father is very strict about it. Mikey replies to Ron that his father works during the day and wouldn't be home if they choose to head over.

Mikey has not been seen since Season 5 and several events occurred that have left his fate unclear. However, with the grenade attack in Alexandria, several people were killed as indicated by the 
Savior
's lines to Michonne and bodies visible on the ground. In addition, all remaining Alexandrians were evacuated to the Hilltop, and anyone not seen with them can be considered a casualty of the grenade attack, including Mikey who was not with the remaining Alexandrians in "
Dead or Alive Or
".
