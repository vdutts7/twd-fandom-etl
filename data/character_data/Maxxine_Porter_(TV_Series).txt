“


It was just dumb luck, honestly. I found the radio parts in a dumpster behind the 
municipal building
. They'd never be left there for security reasons, so someone clearly thought it was trash. But it 
wasn't trash
. It just needed some love. That's how we started talking, and we talked about... 
everything
. Everything and nothing. I never thought about leaving this place before. Well, I-I did, but I never let myself believe it was possible. But then my 
brother
 got involved, and he was 
not happy
. I knew I'd crossed a line. And with 
Hornsby
 on the prowl, getting out to see you was impossible. And then you turn up with 
some other girl
 calling herself Stephanie, using 
my words
... 
my voice
. You seemed so happy... So, I kept my head down. I didn't know what else to do. (...) No. I'm Max. 
There is no Stephanie
.

Overview
[
]


Max is a plucky and kind individual. She is first heard when she makes contact with 
Eugene
 over a radio, going by the alias Stephanie. The two begin to bond and after finding out their communities are not far apart, they make plans to meet each other. However, after Eugene and his group arrive at the 
Commonwealth
, another 
person
 impersonates Max to get information on his 
community
. Fearing she would endanger Eugene, she stays back to not interfere with his happiness. After fake Stephanie's true identity is revealed, she reveals that she is the real Stephanie.

Max appears to be quite intelligent, shown when she was able to make her radio out of parts found in the trash. She is shown to be somewhat nerdy, similar to Eugene, with the two bonding over things like comets and a novel Eugene plans on writing.

Max soon becomes aware of the corruption within the Commonwealth. When 
Tyler Davis
 confronts 
Pamela
 and takes Max hostage she whispers to him, 
"I'm like you."
 After she finds out about 
Sebastian
's heist, she angrily confronts her brother, 
Michael
, who knew about it. She begins to rebel against Pamela and makes her own investigations and eventually finds a list with many more names of people who were sacrificed. Soon Max becomes a key player in the downfall of the Miltons, as she is able to trick Sebastian in exposing himself and his mother by secretly recording him.

Bonds

Max uses a radio from her community to look for other survivors before eventually hearing Eugene's messages. She responds to him and claims to be happy at finding someone else after being unsuccessful after a long time. They then proceed to talk.

Eugene asks about her community and she says she's not comfortable sharing that information yet but agrees on talking about their pasts. Eugene says he grew up in Dallas, Texas while she grew up in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. He admits to having visited the town for a train fair and to have gone to an ice cream shop. She joyfully reveals to be a big fan of the shop too. They keep talking for the remainder of the day.

That night, Max admits she doesn't know if they should keep talking because they could be a threat to each other. Eugene says he trusts her enough to share his full name and suggests they continue their conversations. She agrees but wants to keep them a secret between them and if she hears anyone else she will stop answering. Eugene accepts to her conditions and they sign off.



"
Morning Star
"


At the Hilltop, Eugene is searching for a music record while Max discusses comets, noting that she spotted three last night. Eugene is frustrated that he cannot find the record, so Max encourages him to sing the song himself. Eugene doesn't believe himself capable of the feat. Max then asks how many comets Eugene spotted, to which he replies four. Max is slightly peeved that Eugene is in the lead, and warns that he "better not be counting satellites", revealing that she saw one falling recently. Eugene realizes that the satellite she observed is the same one that crashed near Oceanside at roughly the same time, leading Max conclude that their groups are located relatively close to each other. Excited to learn this fact, Eugene reveals that his group is located in Virginia and proposes a face-to-face meeting, allowing Max to choose the time and location. Max reluctantly agrees to talk to her people, but asks Eugene not to do the same. Eugene promises to keep quiet.

Searching for Eugene, Rosita climbs up to the attic, where she hears Max on the radio attempting to contact Eugene. Puzzled by the mysterious voice, Rosita answers the call and asks for Stephanie's identity as Eugene scrambles to climb down from the upper floor and stop Rosita from replying. Furious that Rosita made him break his promise to Max, Eugene tells her to leave.

Eugene tries to get Max to respond by singing "When The Wild Wind Blows" by Iron Maiden over the radio. After a while, Max joins in, much to Eugene's joy. Max apologizes for disappearing, explaining that she got spooked when she heard someone else respond, although Eugene claims it was his fault. Max asks who the girl who responded was, and concludes that Eugene must be fond of her when the latter explains. Eugene describes Rosita as his "BFF", and says that he hopes Max gets to meet her some day. He goes on to say that the last few days of talking with Max have been incredible. Max abruptly blurts out the location of her group (Charleston, West Virginia), and sets up the location and time of their future meeting, which Eugene accepts. Right after this, Rosita comes to fetch him for the battle, and Eugene confidently follows her, stating that he has a "date".

Rogue Element
"


As Eugene burns the evidence from his investigation into "
Stephanie
" in a bonfire, Max walks up behind him and says that she needs to talk. She uses nicknames that only he and Stephanie had used with each other over the radio and Eugene turns around. She reveals that she is the real Stephanie and the one that he talked to on the radio.



"
The Lucky Ones
"


As Max narrates to 
Eugene
, a series of flashbacks shows her building a radio out of parts that she had found behind the municipal building despite someone clearly thinking that the parts were trash. Having made contact with Eugene, Max flirts with him over the radio as time goes on, greatly enjoying the connection between them. Although Max had never considered that leaving 
the Commonwealth
 was possible before, she set the rendezvous with Eugene at the 
Southern Train Yard
.

However, 
Michael
 discovers Max's radio while investigating a massive communications breach, the Commonwealth having learned that someone was talking to 
a rogue community
 outside of their walls and 
Lance Hornsby
 is all over it. Michael realizes that it was Max talking to Eugene and that she was planning to sneak out 
" to meet some stranger at a rail yard."
 Michael warns Max that it's dangerous for everyone at the Commonwealth, but especially for the two of them. Michael leaves, telling Max that she had better pray that Lance doesn't realize that it was her voice. Knowing that she had crossed a line and with Lance on the prowl, Max was unable to get out of the Commonwealth to meet Eugene as planned.

Max recalls seeing Eugene after his arrival at the Commonwealth with 
"
some other girl
 calling herself Stephanie"
 using Max's words and voice and getting ice cream with him while Eugene is unaware that the real "Stephanie" is standing right in front of him. As Max takes the ice cream, Eugene asks her if it's Rocky Road. After a moment, Max leaves without saying anything, but turns back around to see how happy Eugene and Shira are together. Because Eugene seemed so happy, Max decided to keep her head down rather than get in the way.

Max visits 
Pamela Milton
 and the two briefly joke about how stressed Pamela is, especially with 
Sebastian
's antics. Max goes to get Pamela ice cream, but she orders Max to have the bank cut off Sebastian's line of credit in the hopes of whipping him into shape. As Max leaves, Lance enters revealing to Pamela what he had learned from Eugene about 
Alexandria
 and the 
Coalition
.

In the present, Eugene asks Max what Lance is planning, but she doesn't know. Max warns Eugene that Lance is ambitious and that his plans could mean anything or nothing aside from the rebuilding of Alexandria. Eugene is surprised that Mercer is Max's brother and that Max is Stephanie. Max reveals that there is no "Stephanie" and that her real name is Max, Stephanie having just been an alias that she'd used while talking to him. Max starts to tell Eugene that Stephanie was her mother's name, but, overwhelmed and upset, Eugene departs, leaving Max behind.

The next day, after thinking things over and talking with 
Rosita
 about it, Eugene visits Max at her home with some ice cream. Max reluctantly lets him in and Eugene spots Max's disassembled radio on her desk. Eugene apologizes for his ungentlemen-like behavior, running away and not listening to her, stating that he was bruised and confused. Max calls Eugene's behavior 
"pretty damn rude"
 and Eugene acknowledges this, admitting that he'd let Lance get inside his head with an infiltration of epic proportions and he let an imposter into his heart and let her read his manuscript. Max's interest is drawn by Eugene's mention of a manuscript and the two bond over Eugene's ideas for his book before Max becomes enraged that Eugene had let Shira read it.

Max can't understand how after all of the time that they spent together and everything that they had told each other, Eugene couldn't tell that Shira wasn't her. Eugene doesn't know and tells Max that he'd figured out a long time ago that he isn't like most people and had gotten used to rejection to the point that he didn't even recognize that it was in fact rejection some of the times. As a result, a part of Eugene had always wondered if their connection was just all in his head, but when he got to the Commonwealth and "Stephanie" didn't push him away, Eugene had wanted it to be real so badly that he allowed himself to be blinded to the truth. In addition, subtle cues escape Eugene sometimes. Eugene had never intended to hurt Max, but he knows that his intent doesn't excuse the fact that he did hurt her. Eugene asks how he can make it up to her and if Max will allow him to try, but Max doesn't know and Eugene begins to leave. Max stops him, asking to read Eugene's novel, but Eugene tells her that Max had found him as he was burning the only physical copy. Eugene and Max discuss the concepts that Eugene is using in the novel, leading to them sharing a laugh and Max commenting that it feels like old times.



"
Trust
"


Eugene pays Max an urgent visit at the Commonwealth headquarters. Max pulls him aside, worried that they'll be seen together. Inside an empty office, Eugene tells Max about 
Sebastian
 and asks her to steal files from Pamela's office. A 
janitor
 walks in on them. Max pretends she's collecting groceries from Eugene and leaves the office.

Max confronts Mercer about Sebastian's heist and asks why he's letting Sebastian get away with it. Mercer points out that he could get removed for subordination if he reports Sebastian, which would leave the Commonwealth citizens vulnerable. Max says Mercer has the power to change the Commonwealth. Mercer doesn't listen. Max visits Eugene and agrees to steal the files. Eugene vows to stand by her side. They share a kiss.



"
Acts of God
"


Back at the Commonwealth, Max is reading a book thinking Eugene is still asleep. He greets her good morning which startles her. Eugene compliments her saying she's the most remarkable human he's ever met before they proceed to kiss. Max goes to get ready for work. Eugene notices Max is having hesitations about his request, though she states she will do it, she's afraid about what happens after.

Pamela is reciting a speech she's going to give at an upcoming dinner. She notices Max looks troubled and asks if everything is okay. Max assures she is fine, but Pamela tries to get her to open up more. Max tells her about an idea to use the money they got from Founders Day to start a scholarship fund for less fortunate families to see if Pamela is truly a good person. However, Pamela turns down the idea, saying it will go into the event. Pamela leaves for the dinner, with Max saying she'll follow. However, she stays back to search for evidence against the Miltons to take them down.

Just as she is looking for some incriminating files, a drunken 
Sebastian
 enters and asks where his mother is, saying he's trying to reach her but is getting no response. He gets angered that his mom won't take the time to talk to him. He then thinks Max never stops working and accidentally knocks down the files in Max's hands. The two grab for it at the same time as Sebastian stares intensely at her for a few seconds, as if suspecting her. However, eventually he lets go and leaves much to Max's relief.

At the Commonwealth, Max, Eugene, 
Connie
, 
Kelly
, 
Magna
 are in a room seeing the files Max had retrieved from the office. They try to figure what is truly going on behind the scenes and plan to have Connie write an article exposing the Miltons. Connie plans on writing about Sebastian's heist and pin it on Pamela. Someone knocks at the door and everyone frantically begins to put the papers away, but Magna stops them and reveals it's just 
Ezekiel
 who had come to help. Everyone looks at each other and agree they have to do this for the good of everyone. 

In the office, Max puts back the files she took to avoid any suspicion. She sits down at her desk when Pamela angrily enters and places down a newspaper with Connie's article that says 
"Pamela Milton is lying to you"
.



"
Lockdown
"


Max and Yumiko silently stand by as Pamela addresses public concerns over a PA system with vague promises and fabrications about finding "the real culprits". They converse on whether or not Pamela knows where Sebastian is, likely in hiding somewhere, and their desire to continue attempting to reform the Commonwealth and bringing the full truth to light despite the risks which lay ahead.



"
A New Deal
"


Pamela makes a speech to the citizens that thanks to their friends and allies, they were able to catch 
Lance Hornsby
 and promises to bring him to justice. The citizens applaud, though some are shown to not be buying it. Max comments to Eugene about how she cleared it perfectly. Pamela then talks about Founders Day tomorrow, saying it is an opportunity to come together and celebrate what truly matters, the people. Pamela declares, 
"We are the Commonwealth!"
 prompting more applause. Eugene sees that Max is troubled about the current events and tells her there's nothing more they can do. She sadly says that Eugene's people are leaving, but Eugene says he is still standing there, which she is grateful for. Eugene offers Max to come visit his community, which she says she might some day. From above, she sees Sebastian watching, pleased that his accusations have been lifted. Max looks at him with contempt and says that she can't leave yet.

In Pamela's office, Max hands Sebastian his speech and he sarcastically reads it, before crumpling it up and calling it crap. Pamela scolds Sebastian for his foolishness and the people need to be reminded that he is William's grandson. Sebastian believes he will prove himself simply due to being a Milton, but Pamela says he needs to show it. Sebastian promises he will and Pamela tells him he as born to lead the Commonwealth. Max, who had listened to the whole conversation, walks away.

Meanwhile, Max and Eugene are at the Commonwealth 
jail
 to meet with Lance. Eugene doesn't think it's the best idea, but Max feels she has to since she may have not known what exactly was going but she did know Sebastian was bad news and did nothing. Eugene understands the guilt she feels. Max says it felt good to drive for something better and that they could actually change things, but now things are being erased. Eugene is reluctant but says if she truly believes Lance can help, he'll go along with it.

Lance is lying in bed in his cell as Eugene appears at the prison door, whom Lance states he thought would be gone by now. Eugene slips in a bag with a candy apple, which Lance accepts while saying he tries not to take things personally. Eugene asks if he could offer any assistance, but Lance says if he wants something, he should just ask. Eugene asks if he has anything incriminating about Pamela and Sebastian. Lance is shocked and admits it's a tough one. He admits that the irony is that Pamela is probably the only reason he is still alive. Hornsby tells Eugene that if he goes after the Miltons, they'll crush him. He marvels at how a few days ago they were wanting her son's head and now they are celebrating the Milton legacy like nothing happened. He advises to make nice with the Miltons before lying down. He tells Eugene to tell Max that she is good at hiding in plain sight and he would hate to see Eugene or her ending up in a cell like his. Eugene walks away with Max, who has been listening to the whole thing.

Max is in her office as she listens to Sebastian practice his speech. He complains some more to Pamela who answers that it'll be great. She hands Max some papers before going up to get changed. Seeing that she is alone with Sebastian, she gets an idea. She places down a tape recorder and plays it without Sebastian knowing. She pours some drinks and offers Sebastian one, which he accepts. Max asks if he's really going to do it and he answers he doesn't have much of a choice. Sebastian then goes on to say it was actually his brother that was supposed to be the next leader, but since he's gone, Sebastian has to be the one now. 

Max suggests that Sebastian could be more than that, but Sebastian just accuses Max of being his mother's lackey who is getting him to do whatever Pamela wants. Max reminds Sebastian that she doesn't just work for Pamela, but she's a citizen too. Max suggests that, rather than leadership being telling people Pamela's words, some truth might be the way to go which people respects. Sebastian gives Max his deeply cynical and entitled view of life in the Commonwealth which Max notes sounds like he believes it. However, Max suggests that Sebastian might just be choosing to be a spoiled asshole because 
"if everyone else expects it, who's left to disappoint."
 Max leaves and Sebastian appears to consider her words.

As the Founders Day activities go on, Pamela steps onto the stage and hands the mic to Sebastian to give his speech. There is a smattering of applause and many citizens visibly aren't expecting much. Sebastian steps forward and initially begins by reading off his script before suddenly stopping and starting to speak from, apparently, the heart. Sebastian acknowledges that he knows that the people don't like or trust him, and he probably deserves that, and it will take a very long road for Sebastian to earn their trust and live up to his legacy. Lacking the words to describe how much the Commonwealth means to him, Sebastian invites the Commonwealth to join him in listening to the wise words of President Milton, the founder of the Commonwealth. 

However, on Max's signal, Eugene plays on a loop Max's recording of Sebastian's cynical and entitled view of the Commonwealth and its people and his disgust for the poor. Sebastian completely loses it and runs off the stage after Max who runs away. The crowd turns on the Miltons and begin throwing things and trying to get onto the stage. The Commonwealth soldiers hold soldiers back, even having to resort to physical violence. Mercer tries to deescalate the situation and makes sure no one fires their weapon. Sebastian barges through the crowd going after Max as the chaos ensues.

Sebastian furiously chases Max through the crowd, intent on getting 
revenge
. Even as ten reanimated Commonwealth janitors attack the crowd, killing several people, Sebastian continues his chase of Max. Finally catching up to Max, Sebastian grabs her and calls Max a stupid bitch, stating that she's nothing. As one of the walkers approaches, Sebastian shoves Max into its arms and gleefully watches as the walker tries to devour Max. However, Eugene shoves the walker off of Max and it lands on Sebastian, knocking him to the ground. Struggling with the walker, Sebastian desperately begs for help from the surrounding crowd, but no one lifts a finger to help Sebastian and just watches his struggle. Sebastian eventually manages to throw the walker off of him, but it grabs him again from behind and bites into Sebastian's neck twice before the walker is finally put down by Judith. Choking on his own blood, Sebastian dies moments later as his speech continues to play in the background on a loop.

Variant
"


In the immediate aftermath of 
Sebastian
's 
death
 during the Founders Day celebration, Max and Eugene are separated from one another amongst a crowd of panicked Commonwealth citizens, with 
troopers
 closing in to contain the hysteria. As Eugene tries to find her, he mistakes another 
woman
 from behind for being Max, who begins to call him out as the one who killed Sebastian. Eugene panics, and is guided along by 
Daryl
 from the oncoming soldiers. Eugene insists that he needs to find Max, but Daryl, determined to save his friend from the situation he's gotten himself into, pulls him into a nearby store to hide. 

Max is sneaking around the Commonwealth, evading the guards. She spots Rosita and runs over to her, however she sees some guards behind her and tells her to go back. Max tries to hide but more guards emerge and apprehend her. Rosita watches as she is taken away. Max is taken to the interrogation room where she reads a pardon. Max objects to this, but Mercer tells her she has to read it. The paper then says Max has been dealing with mental health issues which was the main cause of her actions. She gets progressively more frustrated reading through and reads it more and more aggressive until Mercer tells her to stop and sign it.

Max continues to be difficult despite Mercer's insistence to take the pardon. Max declares that she did what she did because she couldn't handle being part of something so rotten. She points out that Eugene had saved her from being killed by Sebastian and refuses to let him die. Mercer reasons that he is trying to save her from being executed, but Max says she is trying to save the entire place. She then tells Mercer to speak the truth no matter the cost, something their dad once said and to never forget their duty as a citizen. She then says that he would have liked Eugene and been proud of what they did, and be ashamed of Mercer. He walks away without saying a word.



"
Faith
"


In the Commonwealth, 
Pamela
 testifies at 
Eugene
's 
trial
 about 
Sebastian
's death and the impact that it had on her. Over 
Yumiko
's objections, Pamela calls Eugene a murderer that needs to pay, but her objections are overruled by the judge. Eugene worries about how nothing seems to be getting through to the judge, but Yumiko tells him that it's not the judge that they need to get through, but the people of the Commonwealth who are observing the trial, many of whom appear to be displeased with the proceedings and the treatment of Eugene. As Eugene looks around at the crowd, Max gives him a reassuring look.

Yumiko questions Pamela about the lottery and Pamela tells her that it's about opportunity and hope for a better future, drawing angry murmurings from the watching crowd. Yumiko calls Pamela out on this as Sebastian had said that the lottery was a lie and rigged by the Governor herself. Despite the prosecutor's objections and orders to desist from the judge, Yumiko presses for an answer, reminding everyone that they all heard Sebastian on tape calling the lottery a lie. Pamela lies that it wasn't her son on the tape and that the tape was altered, causing the crowd to grow even angrier, not believing Pamela's claims. Yumiko demands to know if Pamela really wants them to believe that someone altered Sebastian's voice on the tape and Pamela places the blame on Eugene, calling him an enemy of the state who had admitted to playing the tape and causing chaos on Founder's Day, but no one in the crowd believes the governor's lies with one woman even calling for Eugene to be freed as Yumiko looks to 
Mercer
 before staring at Pamela incredulously.

In his 
cell
, an elated Eugene listens as an angry crowd outside calls for his freedom. However, while Eugene and Max are pleased that Yumiko had succeeded in getting through to the people of the Commonwealth, Yumiko is more subdued as there are still soldiers out there holding the line and doing Pamela's bidding. If the soldiers aren't on their side, it doesn't matter how fast they inspire an uprising, it might not be fast enough. Max realizes that Yumiko is saying that they're going to lose the case and that the people outside can't stop what's going to happen next. Eugene sadly suggests that it might be time to accept the situation that he's in. Eugene knew that this could and probably would come so now he needs to prepare. When the judge declares him guilty, Eugene will allow himself to be escorted to his execution and both Eugene and Max break down crying at the thought of it. Yumiko suggests that since Mercer commands respect in the Commonwealth, if they can get him to admit that Pamela is corrupt on the witness stand, they might stand a chance. However, Max is convinced that her brother won't speak out against Pamela and that Mercer would've done it when Princess was taken if he was going to do it. Yumiko suggests that Mercer might not know with the way that Pamela runs things, and although Max knows that Mercer's men won't let her anywhere near his office, Yumiko thinks that Mercer might talk to her instead.

At the trial, the prosecution rests its case and Yumiko prepares to as well after glancing at Mercer. However, Eugene asks for permission to address the court on his own behalf over Yumiko's objections. 
"The way I see it, I've been living on borrowed time for well past a decade now. And by all rights, someone like me should've met my maker on the very first day that things started to fall apart. But the thing is, I would've, were it not for the aid of friends. Friends who have not only changed me, but changed the hearts and minds of so many others. I am beyond certain that my fate will not discourage them from keeping that going, from helping others to find the courage to do what's right. I was not always a good man. Some time ago, I fell in with a 
posse
 who thrived doing some downright unseemly acts on the reg. I looked the other way. I placed value on order and safety above all other things, but I soon realized that I wasn't the one swinging the 
bat
, I nevertheless had blood on my hands. I knew what was happening. My inaction made me culpable and I hated myself for that. So, I did 
something
. In my own little way, I changed the world. And I learned that one person can do that, and sometimes all it takes is one person to do that,"
 states Eugene with most of the court looking affected by his words. Yumiko rests her case and Eugene is found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to public execution in one hour, leading to outcry from the crowd watching the trial. As the soldiers and the judge struggle to restore order, Pamela leaves with a victorious smirk on her face. Eugene is led out as Max exchanges a look with her brother and Yumiko lowers her head in grief.



"
Family
"


Yumiko
 and Max sit in an empty apartment when a knock sounds at the door. Much to their surprise and relief, 
Mercer
 is on the other side with 
Eugene
. Eugene hugs Max, explaining that he's alright thanks to Mercer. Mercer explains that he didn't tell them his plans as it was safer for everyone. Eugene notes that Mercer has joined a long line of people who have saved Eugene's life through the years, and he promises to never forget it. Yumiko asks about their next move and if it's for them to try to leave. However, Mercer orders them to lay low instead and Max and Yumiko insist that they can help. Although they lost in court, they were heard, and the people are angry. They just need to push the Commonwealth residents past the tipping point to get them rise up against Pamela's corrupt regime. Mercer acknowledges this, stating that first he needs to gather enough troops willing to make a move on Pamela, but if Yumiko and Max can keep the public fired up, it may give them enough cover to put things in place. Eugene asks how he can help, but Mercer orders Eugene to stay in the apartment out of sight. As radio calls go out looking for Mercer, Lieutenant 
Rose
 knocks on the door with the warning that they are out of time. Rose blatantly lies over the radio that he doesn't see Mercer who is currently taking a statement from a potential witness, promising to send Mercer their way as soon as he comes back. With a reminder to Eugene to stay out of sight, Mercer leaves with Yumiko and Max to 
"get this dog and pony show started."
 Once they leave, Eugene locks the door behind them.

Outside of the police station, the Commonwealth Army gears up while an announcement plays over the PA system of lockdown procedures being initiated. Max approaches her brother who explains that a herd is approaching the city and they are being sent out to divert it. Max reminds Mercer that this is exactly what Pamela did 
before
: she used a herd as an excuse to clear the streets during a period of civil unrest. Max wonders how Pamela is doing it, but while Mercer doesn't know, it doesn't change the goal. Looking at the soldiers close by, Mercer loudly states that everyone has to report home, including Max, and they don't need to give hotheads an excuse to start trouble. Max asks if they're just supposed to wait for Mercer and his men to deal with the herd and end the lockdown. Mercer whispers to Max that his girlfriend's coming back with her friends, but cuts himself off before he can go into too many details after noticing 
Vickers
 patrolling close by. Sending Rose to distract Vickers, Mercer tells Max that he was supposed to go meet them himself, but if Mercer can get them in, Max and Yumiko have to go meet them in Union Station. 
Anton
 brings the news that the vehicles are ready to roll and asks if this is everyone which Mercer confirms it is for now. Hugging his sister, Mercer orders her to keep the others hidden until he gets back and drives off with his men. Staying behind, Vickers looks between Mercer and Max suspiciously.

In Union Square, Yumiko and Max observe the heavily guarded doors to 
Union Station
 from across the street. Hearing twigs snapping, Yumiko spots a hooded Eugene sneaking around a train car, armed with Brooks' rifle and she tells Max that they are going to go around. Inside, under cover of the smokescreen, 
Daryl
 and the others manage to break the chains sealing a side door. As a trooper approaches the doors, Eugene ambushes him and knocks the man out with the butt of his rifle. 
Magna
 finally breaks through the doors, and everyone is reunited with Eugene, Yumiko and Max before quickly making their escape.

The Coalition races through the streets towards the 
hospital
 with Daryl carrying the unconscious 
Judith
. Commonwealth vehicles drive up and block their path in multiple directions, forcing them to fall back. Carol realizes that the soldiers aren't following them as they begin to erect barricades in the streets. Loudly yelling and firing their guns in the air, Commonwealth soldiers lead the herd in their direction before closing the barricades, penning the herd and the Coalition in. Spotting a walker climbing over something, a shocked Negan asks 
"what the fuck?"
 As walkers close in from multiple directions, Luke and Jules emerge from the herd, causing Kelly to nearly shoot them before Connie stops her sister. Fleeing down a side street, Carol spots an alley near part of the herd and everyone attacks the walkers, clearing a path for Daryl to flee down the alley towards the hospital with Judith. Waking up for a moment, Judith calls out 
"daddy?"
 and witnesses her friends and loved ones struggling to hold back the herd before passing out again.

Trivia
[
]


Shortly after the promo photos for "Out of the Ashes" were released, AMC re-credited this character as 
Max
 (rather than Stephanie) in an attempt to avoid giving away any plotline spoilers and hide her true identity.

However, in a slight subversion from the comics, it ended up being revealed that her name actually is "Max".


Max is one of the fourteen TV Series characters whose comic counterparts lack a known last name. The others being 
Amy Harrison
, 
Andrea Harrison
, 
Dale Horvath
, 
Carol Peletier
, 
Sophia Peletier
, 
Tyreese Williams
, 
Eric Raleigh
, 
Negan Smith
, 
Lucille Smith
, 
Ezekiel Sutton
, 
Yumiko Okumura
, 
Luke Abrams
, and 
Kayla Brand
.

Max is also the first character of the TV Series whose first name was changed differently compared to her comic counterpart.

That being said, she does fill out a similar role to that of 
Maxwell Hawkins
 with being 
Pamela
's personal assistant and sharing a similar forename.


Max is the only main character left in Season 11C who is credited under "Also Starring".


Max is the twelfth main character to outlive her comic book 
counterpart
, with the first being 
Shane Walsh
, the second being 
Carol Peletier
, the third being 
Tyreese Williams
, the fourth being 
Beth Greene
, the fifth being 
Judith Grimes
, the sixth being 
Morgan Jones
, the seventh being 
Abraham Ford
, the eighth being 
Rosita Espinosa
, the tenth being 
Alpha
, and the eleventh being 
Gabriel Stokes
.


Max is shown killing a walker for the first time during the fight in the streets in "
Rest in Peace
" just before 
Jules
 is bitten.


Max is shown to be married to Eugene in the one year time skip. It's possible she changed her surname to "Porter".


Max is one of six characters to survive the 
TV Series
 who died in the 
Comic Series
, the others being 
Rick Grimes
, 
Carol Peletier
, 
Judith Grimes
, 
Gabriel Stokes
, and 
Ezekiel Sutton
.
