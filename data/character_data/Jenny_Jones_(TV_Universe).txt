“


She died in the other room on that bed. There was nothing I could do about it. That 
fever
 man... skin gave off a heat like a furnace. I should've put her down man, I should've put her 
down
, I know that but I... You know I just didn't have it in me. She's the mother of my child.

Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


North Carolina
[
]


Nothing is known about Jenny's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she grew up in North Carolina and met her 
husband
 in Raleigh.



Macon, Georgia
[
]


At some point, they became married and together they had a son named Duane. The trio lived together as a typical family and they would go on several family trips.



Post-Apocalypse
[
]


King County
[
]


During the onset of the outbreak, Jenny and her family evacuated from their home, upon where they witnessed several broadcasts informing other survivors to travel towards a supposed safe-zone in 
Atlanta
. However, due to the chaos and horrendous events which transpired around them, the family was reluctantly forced to take refuge and heavily barricade themselves within a nearby house.

At some point, Jenny was bitten and succumbed to the infection. Morgan was unable to put her down and released her into the outside to roam the streets for the following months.

"
Days Gone Bye
"


It's implied by Morgan that she may have been bitten during a run to retrieve personal items from their house while he was packing survival gear. With Jenny ill, the Jones family was unable to travel and took refuge in an abandoned house belonging to one of 
Rick Grimes
' neighbors. Jenny eventually succumbed to the fever, died, and became one of the undead. Instead of killing her, Morgan left her to wander the streets of the neighborhood they currently resided in. As a walker, Jenny continued wandering around the abandoned neighborhood of King County, Georgia with other undead residents, returning to the house she and her family took refuge in. During Rick's time with Morgan and Duane, he peered through the front door peep hole and watched Jenny approach the porch and attempt to get inside via turning the door knob. Later, after stocking up on guns and ammo at the 
King County Sheriff's Department
 and parting ways with Rick, Morgan planned on shooting his undead wife. He took out several walkers from the second story window of the house with a rifle to lure her out into the open. However, once Jenny was in sight, he was still unable to kill her and allowed her to wander off again.





King County, Georgia
[
]


As her husband was unable to put her down, Jenny continued to wander around King County in a zombified state for some time after and would often return to the 
house
 where she had died at night.

One day, while 
Morgan
 and 
Duane
 were scavenging in an abandoned 
house
, Jenny followed them inside, presumably through the front door which Morgan had left ajar by accident. Jenny attacked Duane who was unable to bring himself to shoot his own mother. Upon finding this, Morgan was finally able to shoot Jenny in the head, but it was too late for Duane who died of his mother's attack and later reanimated himself. The loss of Jenny and Duane drove Morgan 
insane
 and he would leave Jenny's corpse in the house where Duane had died while chaining a zombified Duane up in the house where they had been living. Morgan would subsequently block out the memory of his return for Duane, believing that he had fled and never come back after losing his son.

"
King County
"


Over a decade after first leaving 
King County
, 
Morgan
 returns to put a zombified 
Duane
 down. Morgan tells 
Grace
 and 
Mo
 the story of Duane's death at Jenny's hands and he admits that, after finally putting Jenny down, he ran and left Duane behind to turn. After entering the house with Grace, 
Dwight
, 
Sherry
, 
Oriole
 and a 
PADRE
 
guard
, Morgan finds Jenny's skeleton and tearfully covers her body with a sheet.

While trying to use the 
gun
 that 
Rick Grimes
 had given to him on walkers, Morgan repeatedly 
hallucinates
 them as a zombified Jenny. Morgan is finally able to fight past his hallucinations of Jenny and shoot the walkers. In the attic of the 
house
 where he had lived with Duane after Jenny had died, Morgan finds his zombified son chained up. With Mo's life in danger, Morgan is finally able to use the gun that Rick had given him over a decade before to use on Jenny to put Duane to rest at last.

The next morning, Morgan buries Jenny and Duane outside of the burned down house. Morgan promises his family that he will come back to see them again some day and that it won't take a decade this time. In the wreckage, Mo finds Morgan's family photo album with pictures of Jenny and Duane which will help Morgan to remember his family as they were when they were still alive.



"

Trivia
[
]


Jenny is credited as 
Morgan's Wife
 in "
Days Gone Bye
".


She is the first Jones family to die of infection and reanimate and die.


Jenny and Duane are mentioned by Morgan in "
Alaska
" as he chats with Rachel about staying healthy as a new mother. He mentions that Jenny had trouble keeping on weight to feed Duane, no matter how much Chinese food takeout Morgan brought home for them to eat.


On the walls of 
Morgan's Houseboat
 in "
Remember What They Took From You
" is written 
"Duane, Jenny, you were supposed to..."
 and 
King County, Georgia
. This is a reference to Morgan's lost family who died in King County.


In "
All I See Is Red
", Jenny is seen for the first time physically alive in a flashback to when Morgan sees fond memories of his loved ones.


Opening doors was a rare occurrence for the undead, and only occurred with those infected with the variant Wildfire strain.

This makes it likely that Jenny was a 
variant
 walker that maintained intelligence about how to open doors and remembered where she died, and where her husband and son were staying at. The climbers encountered in 
Season 11
, including the one encountered in "
Variant
", were also capable of such skills, causing it to be mistaken for a 
Whisperer
 at first.


Jenny was most likely a roamer variant.


Jenny is one of the nine 
TV Universe
 characters to appear in 
Fear the Walking Dead
, the others being 
Morgan Jones
, 
Paul Rovia
, 
Carol Peletier
, 
Rick Grimes
, 
Dwight
, 
Sherry
, 
Duane Jones
, and 
Negan Smith
.
