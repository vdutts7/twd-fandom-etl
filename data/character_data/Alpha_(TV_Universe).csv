,,,"Alpha is shown to be a highly intelligent, cold, psychopathic, sadistic, cunning, and egocentric woman who is a hardened, determined survivor and a strong leader to those in her group. Alpha has been willing to commit murder from a young age, killing her own father at only the age of nine. However, Alpha claims that her father deserved it, although it is unknown what she meant by this, it suggests that she may have been the victim of abuse or something similar that had pushed her to such an extreme at a young age. While telling her story to Hera , Alpha states that, before the events in the Baltimore shelter , she did what a woman like her was supposed to do - what they were told. She appears to enjoy being in a position of authority and does not take kindly to anyone who opposes her, as she has brutally murdered her own husband in front of their young daughter after he refused to abandon their fellow survivors during a walker attack, Matias after he refused to listen to her by attracting unwanted attention, and Helen after she voiced disdain for her decisions as leader. Alpha appears to despise anyone she views as being weak and justifies cold-blooded murder as a way to eliminate weakness from her group. This was displayed when she slaughtered Sean due to him crying after Helen's decapitation at her hands shortly before. She is shown to have no qualms about killing anyone, whether they be adolescents, or the elderly as shown by her brutal slaughter of members of the Coalition in order to send a message to her enemies. She is also a skilled knife wielder, being able to hold her own against Daryl and severely wound him despite suffering severe injuries herself. For a period of time between the events in the shelter and joining the Whisperers, Alpha recognized that she ""went mad "" in the shelter and tried to repent for her actions. During this period, Alpha attempted to be a good person and a good mother and was subservient to Brooke aside from arguing about Lydia and Alpha's more realistic view of the world as compared to Brooke. However, a threat brought out Alpha's ruthless side in force to protect her daughter. Alpha states that ""I ran towards repentance. But you can't run forever."" The end of these events would see an end to her attempts to be a good person which she later referred to as the ""death"" of Dee and the beginning of Alpha, the version of Alpha that had completely abandoned her good side in favor of being a ruthless survivor. Alpha is shown to have completely devolved into nothing but a hardened and primitive survivor. She doesn't even use her real name anymore and rarely reminisces about her past, showing that she has completely shed the identity and life she once had and has adapted fully to the post-apocalyptic hell. She sees no hope for mankind returning to its original state and views survivor communities as destined to fail, believing that devolving into wild animals is the only true way to survive. Alpha is also a great manipulator and psychological torturer who has successfully been able to manipulate and brainwash nearly a hundred survivors into becoming savage, psychopathic murderers almost completely loyal to her and the primitive lifestyle of the group while completely abandoning their previous lives and identities much like her. Despite her extreme methods of survival, Alpha is a strong survivor and her effective leadership has kept many people alive, affirming the belief that her savage ways make people stronger. However, she does not appear to care for her fellow Whisperers on a personal level and Lydia herself reveals that those who are lost, taken captive, or killed are left behind and no attempts are made to rescue or avenge them. She will quickly murder any members who question her decisions or displease her. Her lack of personal care for her group was exemplified when she nearly allowed a helpless infant from her group to get eaten alive by approaching walkers simply due to it crying, viewing the act as a part of ""natural selection"". Alpha is a terrible mother and is nothing but cruel to her young daughter and only remaining family, having psychologically abused her into thinking her father was the abusive parent and that she was kind and protective towards her, even allowing Lydia to be physically abused by their fellow group members as well as herself. Despite this, Alpha may not be completely heartless and may only want her child to survive, subjecting her to cruel treatments in order to make her strong and ensure her survival, regardless of the psychological torment Lydia has endured. She even actively kidnaps Alden and Luke and goes to the Hilltop in order for Lydia to be freed and returned to her, something she apparently has never done for any other Whisperer. Despite her cruelty towards Lydia, it is evident that Alpha sincerely loves her child as shown by her shedding tears in ""The Calm Before"" after Lydia refuses to leave the Kingdom with her and she murders a fellow Whisperer in order to prevent the group from learning her one true weakness: her love for her daughter. Despite this, her desire to maintain her power over her group is likely stronger than her love for Lydia, which is likely the primary reason why she murdered the Whisperer who witnessed her crying. However, Alpha wasn't always this harsh to Lydia, showing an obsessive worry for Lydia's safety on Brooke's Steamboat and even breaking down after she saw just how much pain her actions had caused her daughter. This was before Alpha fully became Alpha however and thus before she became as fully ruthless as she later was. After disowning her daughter, Alpha begins to second guess her choice and it becomes apparent that she sincerely misses Lydia, even building a secret shrine to her at their former camp. She begins to show mercy towards others who are in a similar situation as her such as when Frances almost risked the Whisperers' lives by crying over having had to abandon her son thus leading her to comfort her in private. Another instance is when Carol attempts to shoot her to which she forgives, sharing the experience of a mother knowing what it's like to lose a child (though despite this she still sent a Whisperer to trap and kill Carol as revenge for this). Regardless however Alpha appears to have gotten over her feelings for Lydia as time went on and remains dedicated to keeping her dominance over her group and tormenting her enemies into respecting her territorial boundaries, though she is not completely without reason as she chose not to punish the Coalition for trespassing into her territory 3 times previously and instead chose to extend her boundaries as punishment. However, it is gradually revealed that it has been Alpha's intention all along to destroy the Coalition rather than simply keeping them from entering her lands as she personally entrusted Dante , a newcomer to her group, to infiltrate Alexandria and sabotage the community from within, tearing them apart through fear. She also has secretly been sicking herds on Alexandria and Hilltop to slowly wear them out, showing her strong desire to destroy her enemies. It is shown that Alpha holds personal vendettas strongly as shown when she personally lured Carol, Daryl, and their group into a cave containing her horde to kill them all. Upon encountering her daughter again in "" Stalker "", Alpha again demonstrates her love for her child and expresses her desire for Lydia to succeed her as the leader of the Whisperers after her death, showing that her cruel treatment of Lydia has been leading to this and that Alpha truly respects her daughter's abilities. However after Lydia rejects her again and insults her by claiming her way of survival is not the only way, she appears more angered and bloodthirsty than ever and openly declares she will exterminate the communities and take utter pleasure in it. Despite this, Alpha's love for her child remains intact in spite of her final betrayal even though she vows that she will kill Lydia herself in order for her to be truly free. She even develops a genuine fondness and attraction to Negan and claims she wants to abandon the Whisperers and start a new group with him, showing that she is still capable of loving others in spite of her decent into a savage, primitive survivor. Ultimately however, Alpha's cruelty towards her daughter and desire to end her would ultimately be her undoing as she is lured into a trap by Negan through circumstances orchestrated by Carol and brutally murdered. She dies a psychopathic, cruel and savage mass murderer and a hated, despicable mother willing to kill her own child for refusing to conform to her barbaric ways of survival.","Not much is known about Alpha's life prior to or as the outbreak began, when she was nine, Alpha killed her own father, claiming ""he deserved it."" Based on her accent, she grew up or lived somewhere in the Appalachia region of the United States, possibly somewhere in western part Maryland. In adulthood, she had a husband named Frank and a daughter named Lydia . She appeared to be an abusive but protective mother to her daughter, once slapping her after she nearly suffocated herself to death after being tangled in a plastic tarp to ensure she would never do it again.","Alpha, along with Frank and Lydia, survived the initial stages of the outbreak. After 23 days, she and her family remained in a moldy basement with a group of survivors. Alpha was eager to leave, but her husband insisted that they stay. Alpha eventually cut her hair off to spite Frank, who liked her hair long, explaining that she could do whatever she wanted since it was the end of the world. After 43 days, the undead began to overrun the outside of the building. A fellow survivor, Matias , started to have a panic attack and wanted to leave the basement. Alpha, knowing noise could draw them in, smothered Matias to death by crushing his windpipe, believing that he was too weak to survive this world. Later that night, unknown to the group about the virus infecting the living, a reanimated Matias began to attack the group. Alpha then attempted to lead her family to safety by escaping, but Frank tried to save their friends, which resulted in Alpha murdering him. According to Lydia, her mother watched many survivor communities thrive and then eventually fall, including Brooke's steamboat , and she thus evolved into a more hardened survivor willing to resort to whatever measures necessary to survive. Alpha ended up spending over a year on the steamboat with her daughter. While on the steamboat, Alpha, although not remorseful for killing Frank, recognized that she ""went mad "" while in the shelter and tried to repent for her actions by being a good person and a good mother to Lydia who was afraid of her mother after witnessing Frank's murder. In the years that followed, Alpha would tell Lydia the reverse of events in the beginning, that Frank was the abusive one and she was the one trying to protect Lydia, that a reanimated Matias killed her father, and not Alpha herself. After the fall of the steamboat, Alpha and Lydia were rescued by the Whisperers , led by a woman named Hera , who Alpha had romantic interests in. Alpha refers to the end of the steamboat and joining the Whisperers as the ""death"" of Alpha who, for all of her faults, had been trying to be a good mother and a good person before a threat ended the community. This caused Alpha to fully embrace her ruthless side rather than trying to suppress it. Alpha and Lydia either were banished, left the group, or went on a supply run and encountered the former country musician known as Half Moon at a hospital. After bonding, Alpha recruited him to join her. Not wanting to be reminded of his celebrity, Alpha gave him the face of his friend and called him ""Beta"", and her ""Alpha"". Upon returning to the camp, Alpha assumed control after killing Hera. Alpha then let her turn and used her face as her mask. Picking up new survivors along the way, she instructed them to use this practice and all of the group members were forced to shed their previous identities and names, becoming nothing but hardened and primitive survivors. They survived off the land, moving from place to place. The group communicates whilst moving among herds by whispering with gruff voices, hence their name, similar to what a walker may sound like if it could talk. By herding walkers, the group was eventually able to culminate a large horde numbering in the thousands to be used as a potential weapon.","Killed By Carol Peletier (Caused) Carol lets Negan out of his cell, intending for him to find and infiltrate the Whisperers, where he eventually lands in a position close to Alpha. Negan Smith (Alive) After capturing Lydia, Negan leads Alpha to her supposed location. However, this proves to be a trap and Negan slits Alpha's throat, killing her. Rather than putting Alpha down, Negan cuts her head off which reanimates before he brings it to Carol. Beta (Zombified) After taking Alpha's zombified head to a bar and drawing in a herd with his old music, Beta thanks Alpha and stabs her in the head.","This list shows the victims Alpha has killed: Her Father (Pre-Apocalypse) Matias (Alive) Frank Rose (Indirectly Caused) Seventh Man Tough Guy Beta's Best Friend (Zombified) Hera (Alive and Zombified) Helen Sean Hilde (Caused or Direct) Miles (Caused or Direct) Martin (Caused or Direct, Alive) Casper (Caused or Direct, Alive) Ozzy (Alive) Alek (Alive) D.J.

Alpha is tied with The Governor as having the third most appearances in the TV Series, appearing in a total of 17 episodes alive (she appeared as a undead/hallucination both in "" Look at the Flowers "" and also appeared in a flashback in "" A Certain Doom ""), behind Shane with 18 episodes and Negan with more than 40 episodes.

Alpha is the second major primary antagonist to become a walker , the first being Shane Walsh and the third being Lance Hornsby. Alpha is currently the only major recurring primary antagonist to die before the major recurring secondary antagonist. Alpha is the only LGBT major recurring primary antagonist. Alpha currently holds the highest kill count of any female antagonist on The Walking Dead . Alpha has killed the third most main characters with a total of 2: Enid and Tara Chambler . She is surpassed only by the Governor, who has killed 3 main characters and Negan who has killed or been responsible for the deaths of 6 main characters (including herself). Alpha is the second main antagonist to kill more than one main character in one episode (Enid and Tara Chambler), with the first being Negan. It's possible that her name is Deborah as that is the name she used while she infiltrated the Kingdom , although she could have also just randomly chosen the name in order to stay undercover. Her real name was revealed to be Dee in Tales of the Walking Dead . It's still possible that her full name is Deborah, as Dee could simply be a nickname that she preferred to use instead of her full name. The term ""Alpha"" denotes the dominant role or position in a particular sphere or group. She is one of eleven known characters to have seen Beta 's face. The other ten characters being Lydia , Mary , Daryl Dixon , Negan Smith , Beta's best friend , a Whisperer , Daniel Salazar , Grace Mukherjee , Dennis Graham and Silas Plaskett with the latter four being unknowingly. Just like her comic counterpart, Alpha's signature weapon is a sawed-off double barreled shotgun although she rarely uses it. A holster for the shotgun can be seen on her belt. Alpha being decapitated by Negan is ironic as she now receives the death that she gave to the ten innocents in "" The Calm Before "". Negan also jokes about decapitation before he had sex with her, foreshadowing Alpha's demise. Alpha is one of the youngest known characters to have committed murder, killing her own father at the age of nine before the outbreak as revealed in "" Dee "". Alpha may be the victim of some kind of abuse from her father as she claims that her father deserved to die, suggesting that he had done something to provoke her to action. Being the victim of abuse at a young age may explain some of Alpha's psychological issues.
