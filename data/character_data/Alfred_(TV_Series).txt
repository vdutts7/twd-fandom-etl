Overview


Initially, Alfred seems to be a normal person within the 
community
. Like 
Margo
, a fellow 
Highwayman
, he demands justice for the Highwaymen, and greatly desires revenge against the 
Whisperers
 for causing the deaths of 
Alek
 and 
Ozzy
, the latter whom he stated was his best friend. He begins to bully 
Lydia
, a former Whisperer, with Margo and 
Gage
. At night, the three ambush her, but she is saved by 
Negan
. However, he accidentally kills Margo in the process, which Alfred is shown to be distraught over. Alfred is shown to be sly and cunning, as he immediately throws the blame at Negan and plays the victim when confronted by the 
council
. Later, he is shown to have no remorse and brags to a 
guard
 about how he and his friends beat Lydia up. In an ironic twist of fate, he states that the Whisperers are weak fighters, only to immediately get killed by 
Beta
.



Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown


Nothing is known about Alfred's life prior to or as the outbreak began.



Post-Apocalypse


At some point following the outbreak, Alfred joined a group of survivors known as "
the Highwaymen
".



Season 10


"
Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Alfred is among the 
coalition
 members drafted into the militia that was formed in response to the 
Whisperer
 threat. He and the other militia conduct a training exercise on the 
Oceanside
 beach. As 
Ezekiel
 and 
Jerry
 methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Alfred and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat.

They are successful and return to Oceanside to rest, eat, and socialize with the Oceansiders. That night, Alfred helps put out the fire that was ignited in the woods in Whisperer territory after a satellite from outer space crashes.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Alfred attends a training session in 
Alexandria
 led by 
Aaron
 but watches 
Gage
 as he begins to taunt 
Lydia
 with a mask made out of a burlap sack when she approaches them. He laughs alongside 
Margo
 and Gage when she storms away. Later that day, he is eating lunch with Margo and Gage inside the dining hall when Lydia sits at their table and guts a squirrel, in which blood shoots onto Gage's face. As Gage storms away, Alfred brings up 
Ozzy
 and 
Alek
's deaths to Margo and questions how they can be okay with Lydia living alongside them. 

That night, Alfred and his friends ambush Lydia and proceed to beat her as Alfred screams that Ozzy was his best friend. When 
Negan
 arrives and rescues Lydia, Alfred is horrified to see that Margo was killed when she was thrown off Lydia, hitting her head against a wall. Shortly after, Alfred and Gage are questioned by the council. They feed them lies and are in disbelief when the council begins questioning their story, and eventually they are let go.



"
Stalker
"


Alfred and another 
guard
 are inside a house helping each other put on their armor before heading out on watch duty. He brags about how he and his friends attacked Lydia and scoff at the Whisperers, claiming they can barely fight one on one. Moments later, Alfred and the man are attacked and killed by 
Beta
, They are left to reanimate to serve as a distraction wandering around Alexandria attacking others before finally being put down.
