"
Made to Suffer
"
[

Donna makes her only appearance in this episode. She, along with her group (led by 
Tyreese Williams
), are getting swarmed by walkers in the woods surrounding the 
West Georgia Correctional Facility
. While the group is fleeing, Donna is grabbed by a walker and bitten on the arm. Her son, Ben, screams in horror, while her husband, Allen, pulls her away from the walker and carries her to a destroyed section of the prison. Before entering, Sasha says that Donna will just slow them down, but her husband decides to carry her in anyways. Once inside the prison, Donna's screams are heard by 
Carl Grimes
, a boy living in the prison with his group, which eventually leads him to Tyreese's group, where he manages to save them from the walkers that were attacking them. While Carl leads Tyreese's group back to the cell block where the others are staying, Carl suggests that they leave Donna, to which the group disagrees, and she is carried back to the cell block by Tyreese. Once at the cell block, they lie Donna on the floor, but by this point she had already succumbed to her bite wound and died. Carl volunteers to make sure she doesn't reanimate but Tyreese says that he'll do it. Tyreese attempts to kill her with his hammer, but stops upon realizing that Carl has locked them out of the cell block. After briefly arguing with Carl, Tyreese turns back around to finish preventing Donna from reanimating.
