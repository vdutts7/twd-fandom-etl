Calm down. We're just having fun. (...) 
Shut up!
 You talk too much. No wonder your 
mom
 
abandoned
 you. (...) You're such a baby. She must've gotten tired of all her whining.

Overview
[
]


Vincent is shown to be an immature, reckless, and aggressive bully. In his first scene, he and his friends are playing with a walker by dangerously putting their hands close to its mouth, seeing it as fun. When 
Judith
 tries to stop them for their own safety, Vincent shoves her to the ground and immediately mocks her about her mother leaving her. When Judith pulls a sword out on him, he freezes up in fear. Even after this confrontation, Vincent and his friends foolishly resume to play with the walker.

"
Out of the Ashes
"
[
]


Vincent is among a group of teenagers in Alexandria playing near the portion of the wall that had fallen earlier that day. They are taunting a child zombie that is attempting to gnash at them through a hole in the wall. After 
Judith
 and 
Gracie
 notice what Vincent and the teens are doing, they confront them. Vincent attempts to defend himself and his friends, stating that they were just playing around. After Judith threatens to tell 
Rosita
 on what they are doing and how dangerous it is, he becomes angry and pushes Judith to the ground, making a comment about her 
mother
 "abandoning" her. Judith draws her sword on him and holds it at his throat. Judith and Gracie walk away as Vincent and his friends resume taunting the child zombie.

A short time later, Vincent and the other children are hanging out inside one of the houses. He is chatting with another 
boy
 when Judith approaches him and demands to know that if he is the one who broke the work of art containing her and her 
older brother
's hand prints. Vincent confirms that he didn't break her art and proceeds to leave the house with his three friends.

Many months later, Vincent has not been seen. It is possible he is still living in Alexandria, moved to the Commonwealth after Milton's regime, or was killed during the 
Commonwealth Conflict
.
