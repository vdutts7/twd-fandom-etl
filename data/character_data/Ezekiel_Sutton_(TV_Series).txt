Overview
[
]


Ezekiel is described as "wise" and "theatrical". He is known to be caring for others, doing whatever he can for his people, including role playing royalty. Nonetheless, he does seem to be somewhat pompous and enjoys the spotlight. As well as his uncommon first name, he uses his experiences in theater to create the persona of a highly flamboyant and charismatic king, speaking in a Shakespearean-like manner and referring to himself in the third person. Despite his benevolence, he has an uneasy truce with the 
Saviors
, and is shown to have a no nonsense attitude towards Gavin and his group. 

After the deaths of 
Benjamin
 and 
Richard
, Ezekiel decides to join the fight with 
Rick Grimes
 against 
Negan Smith
 and 
the Saviors
, becoming one of the three leaders of 
the Militia
, alongside Rick and 
Maggie Rhee
.

After the deaths of several Kingdommers in a failed attack on the 
Chemical Plant Outpost
 as well as the death of his loyal pet 
Shiva
 by a zombie herd, Ezekiel becomes deeply depressed, considering himself responsible for the deaths of so many members of his community, as well as Shiva's. He tells 
Jerry
 that he's not his king anymore, completely losing his confidence. Later, 
Carol
 tries to motivate him with a speech in order to return to his role as the 
the Kingdom
's leader and get back in the battle, only for Ezekiel to respond that he just can't be a leader anymore. 

However, after Gavin and the Saviors come to the Kingdom with the order of Negan to capture Ezekiel and take him to be executed in front of his people, as well as making the Kingdommers go to the 
Sanctuary
 to rebuild it from a previous zombie attack led by 
Daryl
, Ezekiel changes his mind and decides to save his people by having them get in a school bus and drive away from the Kingdom while he stays behind, being ready to sacrifice himself to save his people. He orders Carol to do the same like she had previously saved him.

Following the fall of the Kingdom, his divorce and getting 
thyroid cancer
, Ezekiel is left aimless and even, briefly, suicidal. Believing his condition to be terminal in the current world, Ezekiel becomes more and more despondent as his condition deteriorates and he joins 
Eugene's group
 mainly out of a desire to do one final good thing with his life. A rousing speech from 
Yumiko
 and 
Princess
' antics lift Ezekiel's spirits to a degree on their journey.

Following the group's arrival at 
the Commonwealth
, Ezekiel finds a new lease on life and a new purpose, particularly after the Commonwealth is successfully able to treat his cancer and save Ezekiel's life. Ezekiel greatly enjoys his new job as the Commonwealth's animal control officer which is similar to his old job from before the world ended of being a zookeeper, allowing Ezekiel to work with the animals that he loves once again on a daily basis. Seeing the class inequality, Ezekiel dedicates himself to helping those who can't afford things such as healthcare, bringing in 
Theo
 and even 
Tomi
 later to help him. Ezekiel dedicates himself to changing things to the point of refusing to leave when the Commonwealth and the Coalition go their separate ways. Ezekiel compares the Commonwealth to the Kingdom, stating that he wants to try to save another Kingdom before it falls.

After being sent to a forced labor camp in the Commonwealth-occupied Alexandria, Ezekiel is reluctantly forced to work with Negan, a man whom he has avoided for years, to build a rebellion against the sadistic 
Warden
. Ezekiel reveals that his hatred and bitterness are of a personal nature, blaming Negan for the murder of 
Benjamin
 who had been like a son to Ezekiel. Negan confronts Ezekiel over his decision to continue to live in bitterness rather than moving on with his life. Ezekiel eventually comes to Negan's defense, inspiring the prisoners to stand up to the Warden and the Warden's own men to turn on him. Ezekiel later tells Negan about the things that he has survived and that he no longer wants to live in the past with bitterness. Instead, Ezekiel wants to move forward and Negan living to make something positive out of his life will help with that.

After returning to the Commonwealth, Ezekiel shows his leadership once again when, even with the overwhelming odds faced by the Coalition from 
Pamela Milton
 and the massive herd overrunning the Commonwealth, Ezekiel refuses to give up on it and inspires everyone to fight for the Commonwealth. After saving the Commonwealth, Ezekiel's leadership and dedication is recognized by the people that he had fought so hard for by them making Ezekiel the new governor of the Commonwealth and their leader, giving Ezekiel the chance to truly reform the corrupt system that Pamela and 
Lance Hornsby
 had shepherded.



Pre-Apocalypse
[
]


North Carolina
[
]


Ezekiel grew up in North Carolina, although little is known regarding his early life. He had a mother and father, though his father eventually passed away due to unknown causes, as did his grandmother. In addition, his grandmother and father both developed thyroid cancer, but successfully fought it off. His mother served as a Sunday school teacher at church. At a young age, he performed in community theater where he portrayed several fictional kings including Arthur, Macbeth, as well as Martin Luther upon where he gained a distinct talent for theatricality.
[2]
 In early adulthood, he studied at the University of North Carolina but did not complete his coursework. 



Washington, D.C.
[
]


As an adult, he became a zookeeper. One day, a Bengal tiger named Shiva fell into a concrete moat and thus her leg was ripped open. With no veterinarians around, Ezekiel came to her rescue by wrapping his shirt around her open wound, preventing a hemorrhage. Grateful for his aid, Shiva never displayed any hostility towards Ezekiel and thus the two formed a close bond.
[2]




Post-Apocalypse
[
]


At some point after the outbreak, Ezekiel formed a community named the 'Kingdom' where his charismatic nature, tendency for theatrics and high respect by others firmly established his leadership position. He then proclaimed himself "King" with the support of his people. Later, he ordered the clearing of buildings to either expand or further safeguard the community. During one of these missions eight of his men were killed, including the father of 
Benjamin
 and 
Henry
, who was a close friend of him. Several also had to have their arms and legs amputated due to being bitten. This incident made him more cautious. Sometime after this he encountered the 
Saviors
 and they struck a deal in which the Kingdom pays the Saviors weekly tributes in return for them not stepping foot inside the Kingdom. Ezekiel thus kept the deal hidden from his people with the fear they would want to fight back. His leadership was successful and the Kingdom became a thriving community.

"
The Well
"


Ezekiel sits on a throne in a theater auditorium with his tiger, 
Shiva
, chained at his side. Ezekiel dramatically introduces himself to 
Carol
 and welcomes her to the 
Kingdom
. Carol, in the meek persona she used with the Alexandrians, pretends to be in awe of the Kingdom. Ezekiel offers her fruit, suggesting she at least take the pomegranate; Carol politely declines and thanks Ezekiel.

Ezekiel, 
Morgan
 and a small team leave the Kingdom in two trucks. They hunt pigs in a nearby city, corralling them into a building where a tied up walker awaits. The pigs devour the walker. Ezekiel turns to one of his men, 
Richard
, and tells him it's a job well done. Richard states, "it's just what we needed." Morgan asks why they bait the pigs with walkers. Richard says that he wants their bellies "full of rot."

Walkers approach Ezekiel's group. Richard instructs 
Benjamin
, a teenage boy, to kill a nearby walker with a machete. Benjamin struggles with the walker; Ezekiel unsheathes his sword and stabs it in the head. Richard tells Morgan to keep the pig hunt a secret from the Kingdommers.

Back at the Kingdom, Ezekiel praises Morgan's skill with the fighting stick and asks him to train Benjamin. Morgan agrees.

Ezekiel approaches Morgan and Benjamin when they are taking a break from training and asks them to join him. Ezekiel and his group wait in a parking lot with a shipment of slaughtered pigs. A group of Saviors arrive. 
Gavin
, the leader, counts the pigs and is pleased to find that they're bigger than the last shipment. Richard remarks that they fed the pigs well. As they load up the trucks, 
Jared
 picks a fight with Richard. Ezekiel orders his people to lower their weapons and Gavin tells Jared to stop punching Richard. Gavin reminds Ezekiel that the following week is a produce week. He warns Ezekiel that Richard will be the first to die if they deliver less than requested.

That night, Ezekiel catches Carol picking fruit from the garden as she prepares to leave the Kingdom. She adopts her demure persona and Ezekiel tells her not to bullshit a bullshitter. You're a joke," she tells him. He uses his normal voice and confesses that he's putting on an act and that Shiva, contrary to the heroic stories that residents have told about him, is a tiger that he nursed back to health when he was a zookeeper. He explains that people wanted to ascribe him a leadership role because it's human nature for them to feel safer when they have someone to follow. He tells her that the only thing that's real about him is his name. "I just want to go," Carol says. Ezekiel encourages her to embrace life and suggests a plan that would allow her to "go and not go."

As Carol stokes a fire in her new home, there's a knock at the door; it's Ezekiel and Shiva. He offers her a pomegranate. She smiles.



"
Rock in the Road
"


Jesus
 takes 
Rick Grimes
 and the Alexandrians to the Kingdom to meet with Ezekiel in hopes of forging an alliance between 
Alexandria
, 
the Hilltop
 and the Kingdom to defeat the Saviors. Ezekiel is happy to see Jesus and asks if Rick and his friends are new allies, he says they are. Rick offers the plan of an alliance against the Saviors, which Ezekiel ponders heavily. Ezekiel reprimands Jesus for telling Rick about his deal with the Saviors. They plead their case; in the process, Richard urges Ezekiel to fight the Saviors before things get worse, Morgan, asked for his opinion by Ezekiel himself, advises that they must find a non-violent course.

Rick tells Ezekiel about a story his mother told him as a kid. On the way to the Kingdom, the was a rock in the road. People would hit it and lose their wagons and such. A little girl's family hit the rock and lost their supplies. The girl sat there and cried and wondered why the rock was still there to hurt someone else. She dug at that rock in the road with her hands until they bled and used everything she had to pull it out. When she was going to fill it up, she saw a bag of gold. Ezekiel agrees to give Rick his decision in the morning and invites them to stay the night.  

Ezekiel puts 
Henry
, Benjamin's younger brother, down to bed. Benjamin urges Ezekiel to help Rick's group fight against the Saviors. Ezekiel thanks him for his counsel. The next morning, Ezekiel explains to Rick that even though the Kingdom seems idyllic, they had to fight for it. Rick tells Ezekiel that outside of the Kingdom people don't have this good. Daryl questions Ezekiel calling himself a king. Ezekiel defends himself. He states that previous attempts of expansion and fighting has gotten people killed, leaving children parentless and loved ones devastated, that's why he refuses to violate the peace he holds with the Saviors. However, he offers asylum in the Kingdom to 
Daryl Dixon
 who recently escaped the Saviors' custody, telling the Alexandrians that Daryl will be safe in the Kingdom. Daryl ultimately takes Ezekiel's asylum offer with Rick suggesting that Daryl use the opportunity to change Ezekiel's mind.



"
New Best Friends
"


Ezekiel, Morgan and other members of the Kingdom are waiting at the pickup location for the Saviors' collections. Dianne shoots a walker with a bow, stating it had the same dress as her sister. The Saviors arrive and Gavin comments that the drop looks light, but Ezekiel angrily assures him they have met their obligations and Gavin agrees. Jared says that he wants Richard's gun and the two men face off.  

Ezekiel tells Richard to hand over his gun, which he reluctantly does. When Jared lunges at Richard, Morgan strikes him with his staff. Jared seizes the staff and hits Morgan with it, so Benjamin strikes Jared and sends him to the floor. Ezekiel orders them to stop fighting. As they leave, Ezekiel bans Richard from attending future exchanges but Gavin stops him and tells him to keep bringing Richard, and he will keep his word to kill him if he doesn't control his temper and as the Saviors prepare to leave, Morgan asks for his staff back but Jared leaves with it. 

Afterwards, he returns to the Kingdom with the others. Benjamin tells Ezekiel he did good, but Ezekiel warns him against being too eager to fight. Ezekiel then tells Richard they will talk later about his behavior.

Ezekiel and some of the Kingdom residents visit Carol in her garden. Ezekiel tells her they are there to clear the dead. As Carol says goodbye, Jerry hands her some cobbler which she accepts before telling them to go.



"
Bury Me Here
"


Ezekiel and a crew of somber Kingdom residents load a single cantaloupe onto a truck, which has been stained with blood.

The previous day, Ezekiel watches residents going about their business with Shiva at his side. One of the residents, 
Nabila
, informs Ezekiel that their crop is infested with weevils and must be burned. She assures him it will grow back. 

The crew prepare to leave the Kingdom for their scheduled drop with the Saviors. En route, they encounter a row of shopping carts blocking the road near an urban lot. They search the area as Richard covers the group from behind. They find an open grave with a sign, "Bury me here." Ezekiel says this world can drive people mad and it is mere luck they are not all insane. Benjamin tells him the world may drive some people mad, but he made them another world. 

They arrive at the meeting point, where the Saviors await. Gavin reprimands Ezekiel for arriving late. Gavin interjects as Ezekiel begins explaining their delayed arrival. He inspects the offering, then demands their guns. The two groups draw their weapons on each other. Richard advises Ezekiel to disarm and he reluctantly complies. Gavin explains that he took their guns because things are going to get emotional. Gavin points out that they're short one cantaloupe. Ezekiel insists there are twelve cantaloupes. On inspection he counts them and realizes to his confusion there are eleven. Gavin explains he's going to teach them a lesson so they understand the stakes. Jared raises his gun and points it at Richard, but shoots Benjamin in the leg at the last minute.

Gavin is shocked by the turn of events, but nonetheless he orders Ezekiel to bring him the twelfth cantaloupe the next day. Ezekiel acknowledges what he owes Gavin and the crew quickly loads Benjamin onto the truck. 

Ezekiel's crew arrives at Carol's cottage and they rush Benjamin inside. They try to treat his wound, but he dies. Ezekiel apologizes to Carol for coming to her but says they had no choice.

Later that night, Morgan witnesses Ezekiel breaking the news of Benjamin's death to his brother. The next day, Ezekiel grimly places a single cantaloupe in the truck.

The very next day, Morgan walked up to Richard as they stood before the saviors and asked "Did you?" Richard replied "We'll talk about it later" Where Ezekiel asks "Talk about what?" Richard reluctantly replied "Its better to speak of it later your majesty" But Ezekiel slowly catches on and replies worriedly "We will speak of it now", But their short conversation was cut off as Gavin and his crew pulled up in their trucks and got out. Gavin asked "How's the kid" Upon seeing nothing but grim faces from the Kingdom, Gavin realized that Jared has actually killed Benjamin at the previous exchange, to which he responds to by telling Jared to begin walking away from the exchange, threatening to kill him if he "threw one look or say one word" Jared complies and walks away from the exchange, appearing to be embarrassed at his superiors commands.

After Jared has been long gone, Richard brings the lonely cantaloupe that caused the death of Benjamin over the Gavin and then out of nowhere, Morgan walks up to Richard and whacks him twice with his staff from behind. After allowing Richard to fall to the ground, Morgan pounces on top of him and begins to strangle him to death with no remorse. Ezekiel is shocked by Morgan's actions and shouts "Cease this!" But Gavin allows him to as he responds with "Let em be!" as the Saviors aim guns at Ezekiel and his men, likely to shoot if they attempted to stop Morgan.

There is little resistance as Morgan strangles Richard to death. He reveals that Richard staged the missing cantaloupe to incite a war between the Kingdom and the Saviors. After the Saviors leave, Morgan explains that Richard wanted to sacrifice himself. Ezekiel is in complete shock he asks Morgan "He...He did this? but is confused when he accidentally refers to Benjamin as Duane. Ezekiel attempts to console an emotional Morgan and tells him he shouldn't be alone. They leave at Morgan's request.

Ezekiel is replanting the burned crops with Henry when Carol approaches. She tells him she's moving to the Kingdom to help them prepare. "We have to fight," she says. "We do," Ezekiel agrees. "But not today." Carol joins Ezekiel and Henry in replanting the burned crops.



"
The First Day of the Rest of Your Life
"


Ezekiel leads a regiment from the Kingdom toward 
Alexandria
. Shiva joins him as well. They reach the blockade of shopping carts previously placed by Richard; it has been rearranged. Morgan appears, still emotionally unstable, and vows to hunt down the Saviors by himself, but Ezekiel convinces him to fight at their side. He joins them as they march towards Alexandria.

As 
Negan
 prepares to strike 
Carl
 with Lucille, Shiva leaps onto and mauls a nearby Scavenger. Ezekiel, Carol and the Kindommers arrive at the head of the Kingdom regiment in an attack, as 
Maggie
 arrives with the 
Hilltop
 fighters. A battle ensues as the Saviors and 
Scavengers
 are caught off guard. Carol works alongside Ezekiel as they take out a couple of Scavengers. Rick and Carl join the fight. Negan orders a retreat as Shiva mauls one his men to death.  

The joint communities successfully push their adversaries back. Negan and his men escape in their vehicles being bombarded with gunfire, while the Scavengers release smoke bombs and scaling the walls and running out the gate on foot.

In the graveyard, Ezekiel is present at Sasha's funeral. Members of Alexandria, the Hilltop, and the Kingdom celebrate their victory.

Rick, Maggie and Ezekiel stand on a podium and address the crowd as the leaders of their respective communities: Alexandria, the Hilltop and the Kingdom, united and ready for an all out war.

"
Mercy
"


Ezekiel is present when Rick gives a rousing speech to the united communities, Alexandra, Hilltop and the Kingdom reminding them they're fighting for their futures, for a bigger world. He vows to stop the Saviors and kill Negan, the only one who truly has to die. Ezekiel chimes into Rick's speech and gives kingly rally cry to everyone. Then, it's Maggie's turn, pleading with everyone to keep faith in each other. If they do, "the future is ours. The world is ours," she promises. The caravan arrives in a large field, where members of all three communities are waiting.

As the sun is setting, the cars get into a formation, leading to the moments which saw Rick, Maggie and Ezekiel's rallying speeches. Rick and Aaron talk about their preparations, as do Jerry and Enid, while Rick, Maggie, Ezekiel, Jesus, and Gabriel talk. Maggie insists on joining the initial phase of the fight, despite being pregnant. Ezekiel offers to let Maggie see the Kingdom's doctor, but Jesus assures him they'll retrieve Doctor Carson, who was previously taken by the Saviors. Rick vows to relinquish leadership and follow Maggie after the fight is over. Ezekiel is eager to reshape this world.

Ezekiel then traveled with the 
Militia
 to the Sanctuary and opened fire against the Saviors and then left the Sanctuary with the others as the herd crew summoned the herd of walkers to the gates of Sanctuary.

Outside the Kingdom, Carol and Ezekiel meet again. Ezekiel is happy to see her. Then he and Carol lead another group toward a third Savior outpost. They see a Savior guarding the front entrance and shoot at him. However, they all miss and the Savior ducks behind a car for cover. He then throws a smoke grenade at the group which explodes, creating a big cloud of smoke.



"
The Damned
"


Ezekiel lays stunned by the explosion of the grenade thrown by the lookout. As he and Carol recover, they are attacked by walkers, and are able to take them out with the help of the half dozen Kingdommers accompanying them. Jerry kills them with his axe. He orders the others to "protect the "king" but Ezekiel orders them to protect themselves. 

The Savior, 
Nelson
, has escaped, and Carol warns that he will almost certainly be heading to the outpost in the woods to the north to warn them, in which case they will lose their advantage. Ezekiel confidently declares that they will catch up before he can do this, and tells one of his men to return to the staging area to bring the rest of the regiment along with Shiva.

In the woods, Ezekiel, Carol and the Kingdommers pursue Nelson, leaving a trail for the others to follow. Carol is pessimistic of their chances if he makes it back to the outpost, by Ezekiel reasons that pessimism doesn't bare thinking about, and remains confident of a successful outcome. They discover fresh blood, indicating that one of them hit Nelson, thereby slowing him down. With renewed optimism, they pick up the pace.

Back in the woods, Ezekiel and the Kingdommers finally catch up with the retreating Nelson, just as the rest of their regiment, over two dozen strong, arrive on their heels. Shiva intercepts Nelson and mauls him to death.

Ezekiel and his people regroup in the woods, where they hear on the radio that the nearby Savior outpost is sending out an active patrol, indicating that they know the Kingdommers are coming. Despite the concern of his closest advisors, Ezekiel is unfazed, and raises his sword, confidently prepares for the upcoming attack.



"
Monsters
"


Deep in the woods, Ezekiel rallies and motivates his troops, over three dozen strong for the upcoming assault on the nearby Savior outpost. Carol notes that the Saviors most likely have the advantage of superior numbers, but agrees with Ezekiel that the Kingdommers have strategy on their side. Ezekiel is confident that if they stick to the plan, they will not lose a single person. Over the radio, the Saviors organize their forces. Later, Ezekiel leads a small number of his regiment through the woods, where they soon hear Saviors whistling. They are quickly confronted by a group of around 20 Saviors, who hold them at gun point. Carol emerges from the long grass with the rest of the Kingdommers and shoot the Saviors from behind, while Ezekiel's group drop to their knees and open fire as well, killing them all and sustaining no casualties. Shiva is seen with Ezekiel afterwards.

Ezekiel reminds his troops that the Saviors they just took out were only one garrison from a compound of three. Later, they stealthily take out the guards stationed at a building occupied by Saviors, before entering and killing the inhabitants, the first of the locations that make up the Outpost. Shortly thereafter, they ambush a second group of around 40 Saviors, killing them all. There, Daniel reports to Ezekiel that they sustained no casualties in the assault. He is near tears and delighted with the news, and informs Carol, who remains cautious and tells him they need to sweep the compound to be sure there are no survivors. He agrees and lets Carol patrol the grounds. While his men begin putting down the Saviors as they start to reanimate, Ezekiel tells Daniel that it was them or the Saviors. He notices a window in one of the buildings and realizes they are being watched. He yells for his troops to scatter as gunfire begins to rain down upon them. His closest advisors swiftly knock him to the ground, shielding him from the hail of bullets. 



"
Some Guy
"


In a flashback, Ezekiel dons his king attire before meeting with the townsfolk. His soldiers say their farewells to their families before heading off into battle. Ezekiel addresses the people, acknowledging the hardships that his troops will face on the path to victory, and his certainty of their eventual triumph. He gathers the community together in a joyous embrace.

The scene cuts to the aftermath of the .50 cal assault. All 34 Kingdommers are dead, Ezekiel survives the ambush but is shot in the leg. Climbing out underneath the pile of bodies that had shielded him from the attack, a distressed Ezekiel observes his former soldiers on the ground, ripped apart by the hail of bullets. He stops over Daniel's body, letting out a scream of despair, before he notices that some of the fallen Kingdommers have begun to reanimate, including Daniel. Suffering from a severe leg injury and finding that most of his dead men's weapons are low on ammo, he can only crawl away before 
Alvaro
 manages to save Ezekiel and informs him that 
Shiva
 ran off after the ambush and he helps take Ezekiel to safety. 

However, Alvaro is suddenly shot and killed by 
Gunther
, who prepares to take Ezekiel back to the Sanctuary to help clear out enough walkers so that the Saviors can get their guns inside. Along the way, Ezekiel refuses to let Gunther or the Saviors use him against his people, but Gunther insults the Kingdommers before standing on Ezekiel's leg and forcing him back on his feet. On the way forward, Gunther denounces Ezekiel's title and the Kingdom's way of life, exclaiming that under his kingly appearance and mannerisms is just "some meaningless conman in a costume". 

Gunther and Ezekiel reach the main gate, where Gunther discovers to his dismay that the gate is padlocked. Ezekiel notes that the herd is bearing down on them and asks for his sword back, suggesting they fight them together. Gunther instead rips off his overcoat, intending to use it to safely climb over the razor wire fence and into the outpost. Ezekiel protests, reminding him of his injured leg, but Gunther kicks him to the ground, declaring that while Negan intended to have the three Militia leaders chained to the Sanctuary fences, he decided to take matters into his own hands with Ezekiel by beheading him and setting his head on a pike. As Gunther prepares to kill Ezekiel, he is suddenly saved by 
Jerry
, who kills Gunther with his battle axe.

Jerry, battered from the war, helps Ezekiel to his feet and props him against the fence. He puts down two former Kingdommers with Ezekiel's sword before returning it to him with a "your Majesty". Ezekiel, discouraged by Gunther's taunts and insults, denounces this, but Jerry insists that he continue bestowing that title on him. He takes his axe and begins swinging at the chain on the gate. Jerry continues to swing at the chain, but finds that it's not breaking. In a last attempt to breach it, he slips the axe's handle through the chain and tries to wrench it off, but breaks the axe head off in the process. The men find that the herd is closing in on them. With no time to break the gate open, both men decide to fight off the herd. Ezekiel and Jerry begin to fight back against the oncoming herd. Jerry takes a moment to thank Ezekiel for "being such a cool dude" before continuing the slaughter.

Flashing back to the Kingdom during preparations for the war, Carol asks if Ezekiel's fought before, to which he confirms, adding that he is ready to fight in the upcoming battle and become a warrior. He recounts his former career as a zookeeper, describing his saving of Shiva as a seconds long decision of whether or not to become the person who would take the risk to better those in need. He further recounts Benjamin's words to him several years afterwards, "If you're asked to be the hero, be the hero." He asks Carol if becoming the stronger person she is now was part of her nature or if it was a choice, like Ezekiel's. She affirms the latter.

In the present, Ezekiel and Jerry prepare to fight the oncoming herd to their deaths but Carol saves them and informs them that the guns are not going to reach The Sanctuary with Daryl and Rick in pursuit. Ezekiel, Jerry and Carol fight their way through more walkers. Ezekiel begins to falter and begs the others to leave him, knowing he'll slow them down with his injury, but they refuse. They eventually reach a polluted creek bed, where more walkers are roaming. They manage to push through, but Ezekiel turns back, fighting off the approaching walkers and yelling for the others to leave him. Jerry refuses to leave, feeling it is his duty to protect his king, Ezekiel breaks down and shouts to Jerry that he is not his majesty, nor a king, just some guy and that this is what the world is now.

Suddenly, Shiva jumps into the fray, mauling walkers and violently throwing several aside. Ezekiel cries out to her in horror, telling her to run, but it was too late, as she is brought down and devoured by the walkers in order to allow their escape. Ezekiel breaks down, totally devastated in losing his beloved friend and companion.

The three make it back to the Kingdom, battered, bruised and broken. The townspeople gather to find that Ezekiel, Carol and Jerry are the only survivors of the fight. Broken-spirited, Ezekiel is at a loss for words and, unable to address the mourning crowd, limps off to his quarters.



"
The King, the Widow, and Rick
"


Heartbroken and depressed by all the losses he has suffered, Ezekiel hides in his quarters guarded by Jerry who refuses to give up his job. Ezekiel is later confronted by Carol, wearing regular clothes and holding Shiva's leash. Ezekiel insists that he was never a king, he just played a part that he can no longer do and he tells her to leave him alone. While Carol initially complies, she eventually turns back to ask why Ezekiel kept coming to visit her. Ezekiel eventually admits that "it made me feel real, not a fiction. Real."

Carol tells Ezekiel that to her and the people of the Kingdom, he is real and his people need him. Carol reminds Ezekiel that he has his inspired everyone to build the Kingdom, to get this far and they continue to need his leadership. "You have to help them grieve, to move on, to end this. You owe them that, Henry needs you. Those people need King Ezekiel. And if you can't be the king then do what you do best and act the part. I have to act everyday, it used to bother me, but this is who I am and I am still standing. I just have to act like everything is normal, until it is. Its what they need and its what you have to give them." However, Ezekiel continues to refuse.



"
How It's Gotta Be
"


Ezekiel, still depressed in the theatre, reads a note left by Jerry explaining his decision to join the Alexandrians for the final push and urging Ezekiel to join him. Sitting next to his throne and holding 
Shiva
's leash, he overhears the arrival of 
Gavin
 and 
the Saviors
 and escapes his throne room as Saviors pour in through the doors. 

Later on, Ezekiel uses gasoline-filled barrels to create an explosion as a distraction and drives up inside of a school bus in order to escort the Kingdom residents to safety. As Carol arrives at the gates and with The Saviors in pursuit of him, Ezekiel tells her to save everyone the way she saved him and locks the gates shut using Shiva's chain. Ezekiel is then knocked to the ground and captured by Gavin.

Having captured Ezekiel, Gavin laments that he didn't want this to happen and that he actually liked him, nearly apologizing and feeling great remorse for Benjamin's death, but because of his rebellion, he tells him many more people now have to die. He says that Ezekiel will simply have to swallow it as he does. Gavin tells Ezekiel that the Saviors are going to put his dead body on the Sanctuary fence for all his people to see. Afterwards, he orders his men to take Ezekiel and hold him hostage.



"
Honor
"


At the Kingdom, Ezekiel is held captive by Gavin. He tells Ezekiel that Negan is going to kill him. "I ferried my people to freedom," Ezekiel says. "What befalls me now matters not." Gavin insists it matters and he liked Ezekiel. Ezekiel understood the world and the terms but now that's all gone thanks to Rick. Ezekiel urges Gavin to join Rick's side before it's too late for him. Gavin barks out orders to his men, but Ezekiel challenges his authority.

A man loads Gavin's truck and Gavin insists they leave some room for Ezekiel. Gavin tries to explain himself to Ezekiel. He wasn't hoping for this and doesn't like it. Ezekiel promises it is not to late to change something already decided but Gavin says Ezekiel did just that and it got him here. He radios for other men but gets no response. Ezekiel again urges him to change his mind. Gunshots ring out and Gavin orders everyone to get Ezekiel inside.

In the theater, Ezekiel is punched by Gavin, who insists it is too late. Ezekiel insists he was once saving Gavin's life, but he is no longer doing that. An explosion rings out from a side door. The Saviors shoot at it. Gavin orders them to stop. Carol and Morgan kick down scenery on the stage and begin the shootout against the Saviors. Gavin is shot in the leg. Carol dives for cover. A Savior tackles Morgan on stage. Ezekiel shoots a Savior who had her pinned down. Morgan wrestles the man on stage. He takes three punches to the face before sticking his hand into a hole in the man's stomach and pulling his guts out.

Ezekiel and Carol are shocked, as is Morgan. Gavin gets up and escapes from the theater with Morgan missing shots at him. Ezekiel suggests they leave, but Morgan tells him all the Saviors are dead, and chases after Gavin.

Ezekiel and Carol catch up to Morgan as he is about to kill Gavin and Ezekiel insists with Morgan to not kill Gavin and calls ending him "the coward's way." Morgan struggles to spare him as Carol also pleads him not to kill Gavin, Morgan insists he has to, but before he can, a fighting stick pierces Gavin's throat, killing him and Henry is revealed to be the killer, shocking Carol and Morgan.

Ezekiel soothes Henry and tells him not to look at Gavin's body. Carol berates Henry for not staying behind and disobeying her, but Ezekiel assures Henry that everything will work out. "All will be resolved" he tells him.

"
A New Beginning
"


During the year and a half that passed since the end of the war, Ezekiel entered a relationship with Carol.

Ezekiel and the group go to the Smithsonian in Washington D.C, to search for a covered wagon and farming equipment. Inside, Rick tells everyone to be safe and the group separates.

Shortly after, the whole group reunites and gingerly uses ropes to drag an old covered wagon down the stairs and over the glass floor. The glass finally gives way and Ezekiel falls through it, dangling by the rope. Before the walkers can bite him, Daryl shoots at one and Rick and the others finally pull him to safety. Carol joyfully kisses him to celebrate.

The group leaves D.C. and prepare to head back to their own communities.

On the road, Ezekiel proposes to Carol. She tells him to put the ring away and reminds him she doesn't want to be asked yet, especially on a horse. Ezekiel smiles and tells her he still loves her.

Rosita and Daryl catch up with everyone to inform them that the main bridge is out due to a storm. Rick tells Tara, Gabriel, Aaron and Anne to head back to Alexandria and the rest will go to an alternate route and spend the night at the Sanctuary.

In the woods, the wagon gets caught in the mud as walkers appear from the bushes. It finally budges and everyone rushes to gather the supplies until the walkers overwhelm them and they're forced to leave. Ken runs back to free his horses but is bitten in the arm by a walker and then kicked in the ribs by the horse.

Siddiq and Enid try to save him but Ken succumbs to blood loss and dies from his injuries. A saddened Maggie sobs by his side before putting him down.

At the Sanctuary, Rick and the group arrive to deliver supplies. Michonne points out graffiti that proclaims, 
"We are still Negan"
, and Daryl demands Justin to clean it up. Rick promises to the Saviors that he'll continue to support them so they can get back on their feet. Everyone applauds him and treat him like a celebrity.

The next day, Carol tells Ezekiel she's staying at Sanctuary. Ezekiel feels that she is trying to be away but she denies it and kisses him, before telling him to kiss Henry for her and instructing Jerry to take care of him as they head off.



"
The Bridge
"


At a camp, which the communities have set up in the woods, Ezekiel explains to Henry how vital the bridge will be in connecting the communities. Carol hands Henry his stick, kisses him goodbye and tells Ezekiel she's still going to remain at the Sanctuary.

When the herd arrive at the labor site and a commotion ensues, Ezekiel arrives with Rick and the others to help.

At night, as everyone laughs and talks, Carol asks Ezekiel for the ring. He gets excited and it's about to give a speech but she tells him that he can tell her the speech later. She puts on the ring and they hug and smile.



"
What Comes After
"


On the bridge, as Rick limps away before collapsing, he hallucinates as Ezekiel and the others rush past him to kill the walkers. Michonne stops and sees Rick's wound. She reminds him she fell in love with him because he's a fighter. After killing the walkers, everyone stops to watch them. Michonne tells Rick how much she loves him and he tells her, 
"This isn't real."
 Michonne tells him to wake up and he does, now alone on the bridge.



"
Who Are You Now?
"


Six years later, in the Kingdom, a longer haired Carol wakes up next to Ezekiel and admires as everyone works in the community.  

Later, Ezekiel arrives at the basement to find a teenage Henry, whom they have adopted, trying to fix the pipes. Henry berates him about their deteriorating community, but Ezekiel warns him to watch his tone. Shortly after, Carol reminds Ezekiel that Henry isn't wrong and he could benefit by moving to Hilltop to become Earl's apprentice.

Later, Ezekiel bids farewell to Henry as he and Carol prepare to trek to Hilltop. Henry assures him they'll see each other before the fair. Carol tells him that Henry inherited the dreamer part from him and Ezekiel mentions that the fair is his way to reunite the communities.



"
Bounty
"


In a flashback, Ezekiel, Carol, and Jerry are in a clearing on the woods. Jerry tells Ezekiel and Carol that Nabila is pregnant, and a jubilant Ezekiel congratulates him. Suddenly, Jesus and Tara ride up to them. Tara tells them that she has left Alexandria and hands Ezekiel the community charter before leaving. He then promises Carol that someday the community leaders will all sign it together. 

In the present, Ezekiel looks longingly at the charter in the Kingdom. Diane catches him up on plans to head out to hunt deers. Outside, he watches happily as everyone is setting things ready for the fair. Carol catches up and decides to accompany him. 

Later, in the woods, Ezekiel suggests Carol take another caravan back to Kingdom while he goes with another group. Carol senses something's up so Ezekiel explains he and his people planned a minor side mission to grab something for the fair. Carol agrees to tag along and they go to an abandoned movie theater.

Outside the movie theater, Ezekiel reveals to Carol that he wants to get a projector bulb, but she's understandably upset they're risking so much for something so trivial. Ezekiel explains how important it could be for families and she relents. Jerry then uses a boombox to draw the walkers away from the theater.

Inside, Carol helps Ezekiel unhinge a movie poster frame to use for their charter. Carol suggests him that if the fair doesn't bring everyone together, they should stay at Hilltop. Suddenly, Jerry tells them that the bulb fell into the walker infested room. Ezekiel considers leaving, but Carol steps in and sets up a plan to retrieve it. They take out the walkers, grab the bulb and finally head out.

At night, in the Kingdom, Ezekiel and Carol place the charter in the frame and kiss as Jerry turns on the projector.  



"
Chokepoint
"


In the Kingdom, inside the theater, Jerry tells Ezekiel that his patrol got jumped and robbed on the road by a group called "
The Highwaymen
," who gave them a note warning anyone traveling to the fair will be turned back unless they pay their toll. Dianne guesses it could be Jed's group of Saviors, but Carol politely rules that out. Ezekiel decides they should fight these marauders and instructs Jerry to gather all their fighters.

Later, on the road, Jerry and Carol scope out the highwaymen community while Ezekiel laments the violence they have to resort to. Carol suggests they try talking to them first, and if that doesn't work they'll kill them. Ezekiel, Carol, and Jerry infiltrate the Highwaymen base, where, the leader, 
Ozzy
, informs them that the meeting is for the King alone. They disagree, sticking by Ezekiel's side. Ozzy asks if they have his toll, while his people approach with their weapons drawn. He suggests they use Ezekiel as ransom when suddenly the Kingdom fighters grab Ozzy's people from behind. Ezekiel draws his sword and says he's prepared to fight for what they've created. He then offers the man a job to clear the roads for him in exchange to access for the Kingdom and the fair. Ozzy laughs in his face and draws Jerry's sword, telling them they'll have to do better than that. Carol then asks when the last time they've seen a movie and a shocked Ozzy responds, 
"Seriously?"


Back in the Kingdom, the highwayman return with Tara and the others, who assure Ezekiel and Carol they can be trusted. They hug Tara and ask where Henry and Daryl are, but Tara admits she thought they'd be there by now. Carol reacts in confusion and asks about her son's whereabouts.



"
The Calm Before
"


In the Kingdom, Ezekiel addresses the crowd and declares they've finally accomplished Rick, Carl and Jesus' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 he claims happily as everyone applause and celebrates. He then notices as a worried Carol gets ready to go look for Henry. Suddenly, Daryl, Michonne, and the convoy arrives. Ezekiel goes and hugs Carol and Henry. He then greets Michonne and marvels at how much Judith has grown while Tara spots 
Lydia
 among the group. 
"The plan was to bring Henry…just Henry"
 Tara says angrily to Daryl.

Inside the theater, Ezekiel and the other leaders listen as Michonne says she's finally ready for Alexandria to help out. 
"We're here now,"
 she says. Gabriel announces Alexandria is willing to grant asylum to Lydia, but Tara warns if her mother retaliates it'll be against Hilltop. Michonne reminds her that none of them were trusted when they were first introduced to Rick's group, and Tara relents.

They all agree to send some of their own to Hilltop to guard against any potential attacks from the 
Whisperers
 and Michonne decides to re-establish the charter, establishing that an attack against Hilltop counts as an attack against all of them. Ezekiel then retrieves the original charter as Tara and Michonne finally make up. They all sign the charter, and Michonne tells Gabriel he should sign for Alexandria as the head of the council.

At the fair, Ezekiel and Carol find Henry and Lydia walking around and he tells them he hopes to see them at the movie tonight. Later on, he and Henry say goodbye to Carol as she departs with a group to Hilltop.

Later that day, Ezekiel introduces himself to a disguised 
Alpha
. She presents herself as Deborah from Alexandria and asks him to show her around. At night, Ezekiel is behind the projector as everyone watches the movie when suddenly a panicking Lydia runs up to tell him that her mother was at the fair and she can't find Henry, leaving him speechless.

The next day, Ezekiel listens from the crowd as 
Siddiq
 delivers the tragic news regarding the fate of the missing residents from the fair, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.



"
The Storm
"


Several months after the fair massacre, the Kingdom has fallen due to burst pipes, rot, and fires that have consumed multiple buildings across the community. Ezekiel uses a radio to explain its demise and asks for shelter from the storms to come. Inside the theater, he looks longingly at the community charter before packing it up and heading out. Outside, he and Carol close the gates as everyone gets ready to leave and move to Hilltop.

On the road, the group spots walkers in a field but keep moving undetected. Later, Ezekiel notices Carol talking with Daryl and gets uncomfortable. Suddenly, Jerry warns him they better find shelter before the storm arrives. A while later, Daryl and Carol kill a couple of walkers. Daryl tells the group to keep moving as he and Ezekiel go to retrieve his bolt. In the woods, Ezekiel tells Daryl he wants a fresh start with Carol at Hilltop 
"it would be easier if it was just us."
 Daryl doesn't say anything and looks at him in thought. As more snow starts falling, Michonne decides to take the group to Sanctuary. 

In the Sanctuary, Ezekiel and the other leaders map their route through a frozen lake on Alpha's land and she warns they have to leave now or they won't make it. He doesn't feel sure about the plan since it would mean going to war against the Whisperers. Afterward, Ezekiel laments his failures with Michonne, who says if their communities knew each other better Alpha would have never blended in. She vows to never let them get divided again and reminds him the Kingdom is here with them. The group gets ready and leave the Sanctuary. 

In the woods, the group passes the pikes into Alpha's territory. Michonne kills frozen walkers, unsure if they're Whisperers or not, before reaching the frozen lake. Daryl notices Lydia’s missing again, so Carol leaves to find her and instructs him to get everyone across safely. Suddenly, walkers awaken from the snow banks and the group kills them one by one before escaping across the ice.

In the morning, Ezekiel and the group finally arrive at Hilltop, where Daryl knocks off the head of a frozen walker. That night, Carol tells Ezekiel she's going to leave him and head to Alexandria with the others. He reminds her he'll always love her and she says she'll 
"never regret the fairytale."
 She hands him back her ring, but Ezekiel lets her keep it.

Sometime later, Ezekiel converses with Judith on the radio and says just because they lost their house doesn't mean they lost their home. They get off the radio and he leaves the room, not hearing 
another voice
 coming through asking if anybody is out there.

Lines We Cross
"


Sometime after the blizzard, Ezekiel starts to develop thyroid cancer and keeps it a secret. Months later, Ezekiel and the Coalition form a militia in order to train the several residents of the communities to face any future treats. During the training exercise on the Oceanside beach, he and Jerry methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat as the militia works together as a unit to take out the walker threat. 

A while later, Ezekiel listens as Aaron radios Gabriel at Alexandria to warn him about the recently discovered Whisperer mask at the beach. As Michonne leads a group to look for more signs of the Whisperers, Ezekiel stays behind to wait for Carol's arrival. While waiting on a dock, he talks to Daryl about his time working in the zoo and reveals he was scared of birds back then. Suddenly, Carol arrives and Ezekiel helps her step on the dock. She awkwardly greets him and quickly moves on to talk to Daryl.

That night, Ezekiel and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. However, Ezekiel starts coughing from the smoke and is told by Jerry to rest while the rest handle the situation.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Ezekiel has trouble sleeping in his room and stays awake walking by the hallways. He is then alerted to the commotion of a tree falling onto a house and a portion of Hilltop's walls. As the group debates where to put the injured, Ezekiel insists to Jerry he is fine and he should worry about the injured instead of him. The following morning, Ezekiel somehow leaves Hilltop and rides on his own into the forest passing by the Alexandria convoy. 

While contemplating suicide from the edge of a cliff, Michonne arrives to talk with him. She hugs him and tells him it's ok, prompting him to kiss her. After a few seconds, he pulls away and apologizes. They then sit together to talk. Ezekiel jokes to Michonne they could have been together in another universe and reminds her how much he lost. She admits she was once jealous of walkers, wishing they would bite her. She also tells him that everything gets better in the end as she remembers Rick, causing her to tear up. They then return to their horses and Ezekiel thanks her for her friendship. 

Later that night, Ezekiel and the convoy arrive to help the Hilltop residents fight off the invading walkers. The following morning, Ezekiel helps load the supplies for the parting group towards Oceanside and tells Jerry he is feeling better. He then watches as they leave the community.



"
What It Always Is
"


Ezekiel welcomes Daryl and Siddiq when they arrive at Hilltop to check on the community following their recent attack. Upon informing that they haven't found Negan, Ezekiel starts to cough and asks Siddiq to help in the infirmary. Daryl then wonders if he is ready to talk with Carol but Ezekiel declines and heads inside to help.

Later that day, Ezekiel helps Siddiq in the infirmary before starting to cough very aggressively. He then reveals to Siddiq a large lump on his neck. He explains he has a family history of thyroid cancer and knows that it's unlikely he will survive 
his illness
 due to a lack of proper medical treatment in the current world. Siddiq offers alternate solutions but Ezekiel has already made up his mind. They then bond over their personal issues.

That night, Ezekiel accompanies Siddiq as he talks with Dante over the radio. When Siddiq asks for Carol, Ezekiel sits in front of the radio to talk with her but changes his mind at the last moment and turns it off.



"
The World Before
"


Ezekiel visits Alexandria to attend the funeral service for Siddiq and listens to Gabriel's religious remarks from afar. When the ceremony ends, he talks with Carol and says that Siddiq was one of those people he thought would live forever. He then volunteers to help her finding Alpha's horde but she declines. When Carol asks if everything is okay, Ezekiel is hesitant to tell her about his cancer and only wishes her good luck in the mission.



"
Morning Star
"


Ezekiel finds Carol brooding at Daryl's former camp, and offers to comfort her, even though she claims he doesn't need to be. They both return to Hilltop, where Daryl spots them arriving, but doesn't go to greet them.

Later on, Ezekiel prepares his armor, when Carol knocks on his door and enters. She notices the lumps on his neck, and while Ezekiel brushes it off as nothing, Carol tells him to "never bullshit a bullshitter". Ezekiel mournfully admits that he wanted to tell Carol about his condition, when the latter suddenly kisses him.

After having sex, Ezekiel says that it was fun, although Carol states that that was never a problem. Ezekiel jokes about being at least fondly remembered for something, and notes that Carol has lost her sense of humor when the latter doesn't laugh. Carol claims she simply left it "on a dresser in the Kingdom" before it burned down. Ezekiel says that he left his pride there, too. He then asks Carol if their encounter would have happened if they didn't think they were going to die tonight, to which Carol jokingly says "Wait... we're gonna die tonight?". The pair share a laugh.

Downstairs, Ezekiel is fastening his armor when Daryl approaches him. Noticing the lumps on Ezekiel's neck, Daryl asks if he's okay. "Nah, I got cancer.", Ezekiel replies, but goes on to state "But that's okay, you know what I'm saying?". Daryl says that he's sorry for this, and acknowledges that while he and Ezekiel never really got along, he and the others are nonetheless glad to have him. Ezekiel thanks Daryl for his kind words. The two proceed to arrange for the other to get the children out in case one of them falls in battle.

As everyone is gathered on the front lines including Ezekiel, Kelly puts her palms on the ground and confirms that the horde is close. Indeed, the horde soon emerges from the bushes and approaches the Hilltop. While they are momentarily halted by the electric fence, the walkers soon break through it and approach the second line of defense. Aaron orders the survivors to split ranks. The shield-wielding survivors reinforce the makeshift barbed wire fence, while the melee weapon-wielding survivors start taking out the walkers. The archers, meanwhile, stay in the back and rain arrows on the herd. This is followed by the Whisperers launching fire-arrows into the front lines, setting one unfortunate Hilltop resident ablaze. With no choice, the defenders begin to retreat towards the Hilltop, but are trapped when the Whisperers launch another volley of fire-arrows into the Hilltop's walls, setting the community ablaze.



"
Walk With Us
"


Ezekiel continues to fight with the Coalition as the Hilltop burns and gathers the kids. However, he notices that 
Judith Grimes
 is missing.

Upon arriving at the rendezvous point with many of the survivors, 
Daryl
 finds no sign of Ezekiel or the kids and returns to the Hilltop with 
Jerry
. Having been buried under a fallen sheet of metal, Ezekiel survived the battle and the Whisperers subsequent purge of the survivors and is found by Daryl and Jerry. Ezekiel quickly informs the others that 
Earl
 has the kids and leads them to the shed where they find the children unharmed and Earl dead, having been put down by Judith after turning.



"
Look at the Flowers
"


Ezekiel is shown when 
Eugene
 tells the others about 
Stephanie
. They bombard Eugene with questions, clearly uncomfortable about Eugene communicating with an outsider. Ezekiel jumps in and vouches for Eugene's instincts, inviting the others to at least hear him out. Continuing, Eugene delivers an emotional speech where he explains that he moved to Hilltop for a fresh start. Although he struggled for a while, his hard work paid off when he befriended Stephanie. While he acknowledges believing in future friends might be foolish, he exclaims that, after everything they've lost, he is willing to be the fool, and simply asks for others not to deride him, as he believes this potential alliance is worth the risk. Ezekiel nods in approval.

Jerry catches Ezekiel readying his horse, and tries to talk him out of it. Ezekiel asks if this is because he is sick, but Jerry replies that it's only because he will miss Ezekiel. Jerry, however, accepts that he can't stop a man from being foolish, to which Ezekiel replies "Or a man willing to believe in future friends". Jerry questions if this is Ezekiel's sole motivation, but the latter claims that it is enough for now. Ezekiel tells him that the Kingdom needs Jerry, and charges his former bodyguard with carrying on their legacy. Jerry accepts this, and nearly calls his former leader "Boss", but stops himself and calls him Ezekiel instead. The two hug each other goodbye.

Ezekiel, Eugene and 
Yumiko
 make the trip to travel to Stephanie's location Eugene wonders if the Stephanie's group has candy, reminiscing about his mother, who used to buy him chocolate bunnies on Easter. Yumiko hopes that Eugene didn't take them on a journey so they can find chocolate bunnies, but the latter claims their journey is for the future hope of mankind, although candy would be nice. Eugene notes Ezekiel is in a foul mood, so offers to cheer him up, but the latter declines. The trio stumble upon a couple of caged walkers. Yumiko wonders if the Whisperers did this, but Eugene points out it's not their modus operandi. Yumiko suggests they take a few moments to investigate, in case the walkers are a warning. Ezekiel rides out into a clearing, where he dismounts to put down three walkers. He quickly tires out after killing the first two, however, and barely manages to kill the third one. He takes a moment to rest, before Yumiko calls him back.

Ezekiel, Yumiko, and Eugene camp out under an overpass, when Ezekiel's horse suddenly collapses. Ezekiel rushes over to see what's wrong, and discovers a bite wound that his horse had sustained while Ezekiel was fighting walkers earlier. Ezekiel mournfully comforts it, before putting the unfortunate animal down. Devastated, Ezekiel says that he shouldn't have come, but Yumiko tells him it was just an accident. Ezekiel requests his companions leave him behind if he falls, but Yumiko refuses. Ezekiel states that his horse wasn't strong enough to make the journey, and he might not be either. He claims to be okay with that, but is not okay with putting them at risk. When Yumiko asks if he wants to turn back because of what might happen, Ezekiel replies that it's for the best. Yumiko exclaims that they don't know what lies ahead. She reminisces about all the plans she had, but in the end, no one really cared, so she is here now to find out what's possible, what none of them could predict or imagine. She tells Ezekiel that they need a man who built a Kingdom in the apocalypse.

As they ride through the empty city, Yumiko wonders how improbable it is that the city is so deserted. They start seeing walkers in various outfits tied to furniture and vehicles, in a way that makes it seem like the walkers are doing everyday activities they might have been doing before the outbreak. When Ezekiel sees a walker handcuffed to a steering wheel in a vehicle, and a police officer walker chained to the hood of said vehicle, he starts laughing hysterically. When the trio enter an alley, they are confronted by a flamboyantly dressed, machine gun-wielding 
survivor
, who enthusiastically greets them.



"
The Tower
"


Startled by the stranger they've just encountered, Yumiko asks for her name and what she wants. Offended at her tone, the stranger points out that Yumiko and her group were the ones making noise, and that she thought they needed help, and goes on to lament how the first people she's seen in over a year turned out to be "meanies". Ezekiel tells the survivor she just startled them, and they didn't know if she was attacking. Bemused, she tells the group that, if she wanted to attack them, she would point the gun at them, but claims she was just saying "hello". The stranger, however, proceeds to hold the group at gunpoint, unsure of their intentions. Ezekiel defuses the situation, claiming they don't want to hurt her and were simply admiring her "displays". The stranger quickly lightens up and reveals that she tied up the walkers to make the city feel more alive. She is ecstatic that she met actual people again, but then wonders if the survivors are actually hallucinations. Still, she is exited at the prospect of talking to potentially real people, and introduces herself as Juanita Sanchez, but adds that she prefers the moniker of "Princess", since she never liked her first name and "Queen" makes her sound old and pretentious". After Ezekiel introduces himself and his friends, Juanita offers to show them around the city, but Eugene informs her that they can't stay, as they are on an important mission. Slightly peeved, Juanita still offers to act as their guide through the city, but Yumiko declines, as the survivors don't know her. Juanita protests that they do, and demonstrates how "helpful" she can be by mowing down a few approaching walkers with her machine gun. Unfortunately, the gunfire startles the group's two remaining horses, and they run away. Juanita apologizes, as the survivors angrily glare at her.

Princess leads the survivors to an empty field, and warns them to stay close to her and watch their step. Continuing further, Princess counts her steps, as Yumiko continues to express her doubts about Princess, with even Ezekiel slowly starting to share her feelings. The survivors soon stumble upon the remains of one of their escaped horses. Yumiko wonders if it was devoured by walkers, but Princess casually reveals that it's more likely the horse stepped on a mine. Naturally, the survivors are aghast that Princess would bring them into a minefield and keep it from them, but the latter tries to reassure them that she walks through it all the time and can lead them out safely. Unfortunately, Princess lost count when she stopped, so needs a minute to think. Yumiko threatens to kill her if she doesn't lead them to safety, which Princess considers fair. With that, she takes out her water canteen and tosses it forward to check if the way is clear. Unfortunately, the canteen detonates a mine, setting them back to square one.

Still stuck in the minefield, Juanita attempts to orient herself while Yumiko complains that they never should have followed her. Eugene warns that they are running out of time on multiple fronts, pointing to a walker approaching through a hole in the fence. Beside the fence's integrity, Eugene also worries that the mine placement could lead to a cascade. When Yumiko asks him what a "cascade" is, the approaching walker trips one of the mines, which also detonates another mine right next to it. Eugene cites this as an example of a cascade, cautioning that they don't want to be stuck in the field in case of a chain reaction. Ezekiel thinks that he can help, and goes over to Juanita to talk to her. Princess thinks that she is blowing it with them, and while Ezekiel acknowledges this, he also tells her that leading them to safety could go a long way. Juanita once again apologizes to the group, and goes on to chose the route based on a game of eenie-meenie-miney-mo. She then risks her life by taking a few steps on the chosen route. Satisfied that she is still alive after this, she invites the survivors to follow her.

Finally out of the minefield, Yumiko berates Juanita for putting their lives in danger when Eugene spots a street sign identifying the road they're on as Fleetwood Drive. He angrily confronts Juanita about this, as he remembers that they already passed Fleetwood Drive. Juanita claims that there are several streets in the city named "Fleetwood", but Eugene is certain it was, in fact, Fleetwood Drive. As Princess tries to make excuses, Yumiko draws her bow and points it at Princess. Juanita finally confesses that she wanted to take the scenic route to keep the fun going. Yumiko furiously points out that she led them into a minefield, but Juanita pleads that she never thought it would be a problem, as she'd traversed it countless times before. Juanita goes on to explain that she wanted more time to befriend the survivors, so they might decide to stay with her, but realizes now that she screwed up. She also recounts how, when she first arrived to the city, she figured someone would show up eventually, but as the months went by, Juanita realized the loneliness she was feeling wasn't too different from how she felt even before the apocalypse. She laments how someone once told her she is difficult to love, so acknowledges that the problem might be with her, and that a little voice inside her kept telling her this. Juanita knows she should have told them the truth, but didn't want the little voice to be right. She apologizes to the survivors once more. Feeling sorry for Princess, Yumiko relents, and Eugene comforts Juanita by identifying with her, explaining that he also made poor decisions and lied to people so he would be left alone. He then asks if she does, indeed, have access to the wheels she mentioned earlier.

Princess and her companions have finally reached the garage, where it is revealed that the "wheels" Juanita was talking about were actually bicycles. Eugene points out that 15 mph is still faster than walking, while Ezekiel observes that Juanita wasn't actually lying about the garage. Yumiko then approaches Juanita, but before she can get a word out, the latter states that she is not a bad person, and realizes how difficult it is to trust people, so is sorry that she blew it. Yumiko, conversely, reveals that she was actually coming over to ask if Juanita wanted to join them. Princess ecstatically accepts.



"
A Certain Doom
"


As Ezekiel, Yumiko, Eugene and Juanita continue traveling, Eugene crashes his bike. The group tries to fix it, but Eugene tells them not to, because it will take long time and they won't be in time to meet Stephanie. Yumiko tries to reassure him, but he says that the time was set in stone and if they are too late Stephanie won't be there. Ezekiel steps up and tells that after all they've been through, they won't turn back and will go till the end. He tells how Eugene helped him in his moments of doubt and now is offering the same thing back. Eugene is still in doubt, but Ezekiel tells that they must end the journey for the sake of everyone. Eugene points out that he wants to end the journey too, but Stephanie isn't going to be there after tomorrow's sundown. Juanita says, that she has never told that and Yumiko adds, that they will deal with these problems the next day.

The group arrives at the location, where they are supposed to meet Stephanie, but finds out nobody is there. Eugene yells out to Stephanie, that he has arrived, but gets no answer. He is unhappy about this, but the group supports him. After that he tells they are not turning back and states that there are people out there and Stephanie as well around the trainyard. Eugene says that they are going to track these people down and look for them. As Ezekiel and group shares a little laugh, searchlights turns on and unknown armed people runs out telling everyone to put the weapons down.



"
Splinter
"


Ezekiel, Eugene, Yumiko and Princess surrender to 
soldiers
 at the 
rendezvous point
 that Eugene had arranged with 
Stephanie
. Ezekiel is seen at Princess' train car and opens a hatch in the roof and jumps down. He suggests they run, but Princess refuses to abandon the others. Ezekiel says they can't trust the soldiers, then hides as a 
soldier
 enters the car with a tray of food. Ezekiel ambushes the soldier and knocks him unconscious.

Ezekiel takes the soldier's gun and handcuffs him. He demands to know what the soldier did with their friends. The soldier says Yumiko is probably with a medic and insists his people can help Ezekiel's group. He explains that he's merely a grunt tasked with delivering Princess' food. Ezekiel chokes the soldier and punches his face. Princess screams at Ezekiel to stop. She then notices blood on her hands and realizes that Ezekiel, Eugene and Yumiko were all in her head, and that she was the one who was beating the soldier. 

Princess flees the train yard, then changes her mind. As she turns back to save her friends, she hallucinates Ezekiel hanging out with a couple of 
walkers
. Ezekiel assumes the character of her stepfather and tries to convince her to flee. Princess ignores his advice and goes back to help her friends. The real Ezekiel is seen with Yumiko and Eugene lined up outside with hoods on their heads, guarded by soldiers. The soldier inside the train car throws a hood over Princess.

"
Acheron: Part I
"


Ezekiel, Eugene, Princess, and Yumiko are transported into a 
compound
 guarded by paramilitary 
troopers
. Inside an interrogation room, a 
man
 and 
woman
 introduce themselves to Eugene as auditors for the 
Commonwealth
. They question him for hours, as well as Ezekiel, Princess and Yumiko. Ezekiel interrupts his interrogation, and correctly guesses that a trooper who's quietly been watching is actually the person in charge. He coughs uncontrollably. The trooper, 
Mercer
, passes him a glass of water.

Ezekiel's group eats together in a detention center. Ezekiel, Princess and Yumiko agree that they must try and escape, but Eugene argues that the Commonwealth might be able to help Alexandria. Princess asks some fellow prisoners how long they've been there. 
One
 of the prisoners says he can't remember on account of the "reprocessing," then trails off. Troopers haul away a 
prisoner
 to take him in for reprocessing. Eugene changes his mind and agrees they need to escape.

Ezekiel's group discusses an escape plan. Princess watches their guards with amusement, and describes details about the troopers that no one else has noticed. She reveals that two of the troopers routinely disappear for half an hour to have sex. They hatch a plan to escape during this window of time. Yumiko and Eugene wear trooper uniforms and escort Princess and Ezekiel down a hallway. A 
trooper
 demands to know where they're going. Yumiko says they're taking the prisoners to reprocessing. The trooper lets them go.



"
Acheron: Part II
"


Eugene informs Yumiko and Princess that Ezekiel is gone, with the guards having taken him somewhere, apparently. Eugene starts to panic, believing that the guards know they tried to escape, and suggests they come clean about who they really are. Yumiko firmly tells him to not talk to the Commonwealth's law enforcement, or stick to the story if he has to. When Princess asks what they should do, Yumiko gets up and demands to know where Ezekiel was taken, and then to speak to the person in charge.

Ezekiel isn't seen until Eugene is taken to a train car where he is overjoyed to be reunited with Ezekiel and the others. He asks Ezekiel where the soldiers took him, but the latter says it was to the infirmary, where they gave him a syrup for his cough. Their conversation is cut short when Mercer strides into the room. He formally admits them into the Commonwealth, and sarcastically comments that they'll be escorted by a "beat cop." Before walking away, he indignantly informs Ezekiel he went to West Point. Mercer then knocks twice on the door. When it opens, a woman steps in who introduces herself as 
Stephanie
.



"
Out of the Ashes
"


After Ezekiel, Eugene, Yumiko and Princess finish watching the orientation video, the government clerk passes out an envelope to each individual. Eugene asks Stephanie for advice on how to leave the Commonwealth. She offers to help him radio his people but says it could take a couple of weeks to get him access. Ezekiel and Princess inform Eugene that they won't be able to speak to the case supervisor for five weeks. Eugene asks Stephanie if she can get him unofficial access to the radio. Mercer suspiciously watches them from afar.

Stephanie brings Ezekiel, Eugene and Princess to the 
train station
, which now serves as headquarters for various Commonwealth agencies. She sneaks Eugene up to the radio room.  Eugene radios Rosita in Alexandria and tells her that they're safe. Rosita updates Eugene on the fate of the Whisperers but says that Alexandria is in ruins. They lose contact. Mercer busts in on Eugene and Stephanie and arrests them. Ezekiel and Princess stand in the hallway, also under arrest.

A supervisor informs Ezekiel, Eugene and Princess that they've been charged with several crimes and will be banished if found guilty. Stephanie and Hornsby enter the room. Hornsby orders the supervisor to release Eugene's group. Stephanie tells them that 
Lance
 can protect them from banishment but that they'll still have to pay for their crimes.



"
Promises Broken
"


Ezekiel and Princess clear a nearby building of walkers. Ezekiel coughs and doubles over in pain. Stephanie seeks Lance for medical help. They see Mercer escorting a young well-groomed couple across the grounds. Ezekiel rejoins Eugene and Princess feeling rejuvenated from his medical treatment. Lance assigns Eugene and Stephanie to a new location, then tells Ezekiel and Princess to come with him.



"
New Haunts
"


Ezekiel and Jerry are zookeepers for a petting zoo. Carol watches Ezekiel from afar and notices that his throat is bothering him, a sign that the 
cancer
 is worsening. Ezekiel plays with Jerry's kids and R.J. and gives 
one
 of them 
Shiva
's old collar. Carol asks Ezekiel how he's feeling. Ezekiel insists he's doing well. Carol sneaks into the 
hospital
 and looks up Ezekiel's medical record. Tomi, who is now working as a doctor, catches her in the act but decides to help her out. He observes that Ezekiel is unlikely to get his surgery in time to save him, given his place on the waiting list.

Ezekiel visits Carol and gives her a keepsake box that had belonged to 
Henry
. Carol again asks Ezekiel how he's doing. She tears up when Ezekiel assures her that he's fine.



"
The Lucky Ones
"


Accompanied by 
Jerry
, Ezekiel undergoes what he believes to be a routine checkup. However, much to his shock 
Tomi
 and 
Theo
 reveal that Ezekiel has been scheduled for surgery to remove his 
cancer
. Theo calls Ezekiel lucky as some people have to wait years for surgery and he assures Ezekiel that his bill has already been taken care of.

Ezekiel later shares the news with an ecstatic 
Carol
 and he realizes from her reaction that Carol was somehow responsible for his good fortune. Carol admits to making a deal with 
Lance Hornsby
 in order to get Ezekiel moved up the list, angering Ezekiel at the favoritism that he is being shown when 
the Commonwealth
's healthcare system is so broken. Carol argues that its nothing that 
Pamela Milton
 wouldn't have done for 
her son
 and that Ezekiel is worth it.

Ezekiel is later wheeled into surgery with Carol and Jerry promising him that they will be waiting for him when he comes out.



"
Trust
"


Ezekiel joins with Carol as she drops off 
Judith
 and 
R.J.
 off at school, and thanks her for pulling strings to move up his surgery. He asks to show her a new project he's been working on, but Carol says she's busy with work that he is better off not knowing about. Ezekiel visits 
Tomi
 at the 
hospital
 and asks him to perform a secret appendectomy on a sick friend. He says he secured an operating area where Tomi could perform the procedure. Tomi initially hesitates but considers the idea after Ezekiel pleads.

Ezekiel and Tomi steal supplies from the hospital. A trooper catches them in the act.  Ezekiel and Tomi sit in a room with handcuffs. Carol enters the room and tells a trooper she can handle the situation. She informs them that they're off the hook. Ezekiel takes Carol and Tomi to a secret vet clinic that he started and brings them to the area where his friend, 
Theresa
, is awaiting the appendectomy. Ezekiel credits Carol with inspiring him to build the vet clinic. Someone informs Ezekiel that Theresa's appendix burst and that she needs to get to a hospital. Tomi says there's no time, then proceeds to operate.



"
Acts of God
"


Ezekiel suddenly shows up to 
Magna
, 
Rosita
, 
Max
, 
Eugene
, 
Connie
 and 
Kelly
's secret meeting, causing them to panic at first before Magna reveals that she had asked Ezekiel to come, thinking that they could use his help. Ezekiel apologizes for being late, stating that he was trying to round up a few more people for the cause. Magna explains that she had told Ezekiel that they needed more people to get the article about 
Sebastian
's heist out, 
"and I got a whole network, ready and willing to ride at dawn"
 adds Ezekiel. With everyone's agreement, they get the article out in an attempt to start an uprising against the Milton's.



"
Lockdown
"


Back in the Commonwealth, Ezekiel, Connie, Kelly, Magna, and Rosita join in the protests with dozens of residents demanding justice for the Milton's crimes following Connie's article detailing the people who have died for Sebastian's heist, such as 
April Martens
, and those who have mysteriously gone missing, such as 
Tyler Davis
, while keeping an eye on the impact their work on exposing the truth is having. While Ezekiel voices a desire to be ready to help the citizens of the community in case things "go sideways", Magna brings up the need for them to have "options". Kelly asks if she intends to leave. Magna denies the prospect, saying that the people of the Commonwealth do still need their help, but that it's only a matter of time before things get worse. Rosita assures them that a decision does not have to be made yet, or until Daryl, Aaron, and the others return.



"
A New Deal
"


At the Founders day festivities. Ezekiel is putting the animals in their pens, but Carol tells him he doesn't have to do it anymore. However, Ezekiel reveals that he wants to stay, saying his place is here at the Commonwealth. He says that he originally came to Commonwealth to help his people one last time, and it then gave him another chance to do more good so that's what he's going to do. Ezekiel lets some kids into the pen and says they can all be better. 



"
Variant
"


Ezekiel lets Princess in on the plan to smuggle Eugene out of the Commonwealth. Princess thinks this is a good plan and they can eventually meet up with Eugene and go on the road again like before. However, Ezekiel states that he isn't leaving, much to Princess' shock. Princess asks how he can stay with all the crazy stuff happening, but Ezekiel sees this as more of a reason to stay: Max and Eugene started a rebellion, and they should try to aid in it.

Princess says maybe she doesn't feel like fighting and deep down the Commonwealth isn't all that's cracked up to be. Ezekiel asks if she thinks Mercer is a good man. She thinks so but says she has known a lot of guys who she thought were good men, but turned out to be not. Ezekiel says although they haven't seen eye to eye, Mercer is probably just trying to do the best of what he has. Princess thinks she deserves more than just the best of a bad situation. Ezekiel agrees and tells Princess that if she needs anything, he will be there.



"
What's Been Lost
"


At 
Elodie's Treats
, 
Carol
 loads up a bag with food when Ezekiel joins her, leading to some playful banter between the two. Ezekiel offers Carol some extra medical supplies to take back to 
Alexandria
 with her which she is grateful for, explaining that she was just taking some more food to meet up with the others. Carol turns around for a moment to grab some more rolls and when she turns back, Ezekiel has mysteriously disappeared. Two men enter the bakery and attack Carol, but she manages to escape out the back door and successfully escapes from them.

It is later revealed that he was abducted on 
Pamela Milton
's orders, alongside the other Alexandria, Hilltop and Riverbend residents living in the Commonwealth, a fate that only 
Daryl
 and Carol manage to avoid. Ezekiel is on board the prisoner bus with the other captives, with a bag over his head and given a sedative injection.



"
Outpost 22
"


On the Commonwealth bus, Ezekiel wakes up and removes his hood, groaning in pain as someone bangs on the side of the bus. The other prisoners, amongst them 
Negan
, 
Annie
, 
Kelly
 and 
Theresa
, follow suit. Ezekiel makes sure that everyone is alright, and Kelly confirms that she's unharmed. Annie notices that one of the trucks is missing and Negan notices that there's no sign of Gabriel, Maggie or Rosita either. Kelly reports that the soldiers are unloading a bunch of stuff off of the trucks, but she can't see the kids. Annie tells the other two that she was in and out of consciousness and that they had stopped for a few minutes during which time there had been a crash. Annie guesses that it was their missing friends which Negan admits fits, stating that they likely bailed, but stops himself from bringing up the worst-case scenario.

The Warden
 boards the bus and greets the prisoners, telling them that today is the first day of a new beginning. The world works when everyone knows their place and the prisoners' place is at the bottom. All of the resources that 
the Commonwealth
 uses to bring the old world back into the new and sustain it all starts at places like this. The Warden suggests that they should take comfort in knowing that good people will benefit from their labor there which the Warden calls their redemption and salvation. The Warden promises that everyone's children are safe and being tended to and that they will get to see them again if they play by the rules. However, they need to work as one to be able to do that and the Warden announces that nobody has a name anymore as they have no need for them. The Warden won't tell them his name and they are forbidden to address each other by their own names.

The Warden directs several prisoners to exit at the rear, including Annie. After sharing a look, Negan allows his wife to leave, but he promises to get his family out of this situation. As Annie exits, the Warden explains that the selected prisoners are being transported to another site while the rest of them will work at their current location until the railroad tracks are clear. The Warden orders everyone to follow him out of the bus, but Negan hesitates, worried about his wife's safety as the selected prisoners are driven off in another direction. The Warden promises that, while the work is hard, they will be protected by the Commonwealth. The Warden suggests that although they have been 
"delivered from the paradise of the Commonwealth, take solace in knowing that it's better being here than it is being out there, in the wastelands."
 The prisoners are set to work on clearing boxcar wreckage from the area.

Kelly approaches Ezekiel as they work on clearing the tracks and tells him that there's only three guards and they should run and make a break for the trees. However, Ezekiel orders her not to do anything and to stop talking and keep working. Negan approaches 
one
 of the soldiers and asks about his wife, but the soldier whacks him in the face with a nightstick. The soldier tells Negan that the prisoners only stop to eat and sleep which Negan acknowledges. Two Commonwealth residents and an Alexandria resident make a run for the trees, but Ezekiel stops Kelly from going after them. The soldiers open fire, killing the three prisoners, and the soldier that assaulted Negan orders everyone else back to work.

Ezekiel collects two bowls of slop and brings one to Kelly who is too 
depressed
 to eat after witnessing the prisoners die trying to escape. Negan secretly approaches Ezekiel who is pissed, having purposefully stayed away from Negan for years. Negan tells him that Ezekiel needs to shelve that shit, but Ezekiel lists Negan's crimes of melting 
peo
ple
's faces with irons, coercing women into marrying him and 
slaugh
tering
 
his people
 which Ezekiel hasn't forgotten and neither has anyone else. Negan admits that he hasn't forgotten either and that he probably deserves to be in a place like this for the things that he's done, and it fits him. However, it doesn't fit Ezekiel, the others, or Negan's wife and baby that is on the way.

Reluctantly, Ezekiel asks where the soldiers took Annie, but Negan doesn't know although he needs to find Annie like he promised to do. Negan is coming to Ezekiel as a soon-to-be father and as a man who has led people. Negan and Ezekiel have got to put their troubles with each other aside and work together for everyone's sakes. Ezekiel asks what Negan has in mind and Negan tells him that he knows the Warden's playbook of using fear as a weapon, causing Ezekiel to ask if Negan wants to scare people into an uprising. Negan points out that that only works if you're the one holding the gun and fear won't work. However, hope will which is Ezekiel's thing rather than Negan's. Looking at Kelly, Ezekiel sadly states that this place thrives on separating people, and it is already breaking them down. They have to unite people, but they need a spark that reaches into their hearts and wakes them up and Ezekiel doesn't know how to do that here when they can barely even talk to each other. 
"I can get you your spark,"
 promises Negan. 
"But when I do... you need to know that I doubt that I'll be getting out of here with you."
 Ezekiel is confused by this statement, but they are ordered to get back to work before Negan can explain himself. Ezekiel agrees that he's with Negan for now as they return to work.

At night, the Warden orders everyone to pack it in and load up. As the prisoners begin to board the transports, the prisoners that were killed earlier and reanimate and are quickly put down by a soldier.

The Commonwealth convoy arrives at Outpost 22, leaving Ezekiel, Negan and Kelly shocked as they recognize it: a renamed and Commonwealth-occupied 
Alexandria
.



"
Faith
"


At the railroad tracks just outside of 
Alexandria
, the 
Commonwealth
 prisoners work under the supervision of 
the Warden
 and his 
soldiers
. 
Negan
 and 
Kelly
 observe the patterns of their captors with Kelly communicating her observations to 
Magna
 in sign language. Working with Ezekiel, 
Princess
 recognizes the missing 
Tyler Davis
 amongst the other prisoners from their brief 
imprisonment
 in the 
rail yard
 before he 
later
 took 
Max
 hostage and then 
mysteriously vanished
. While Princess doesn't like Tyler, she knows that he's ballsy and that might be useful to them.

As Negan gets a drink, Magna discreetly reports what Kelly had told him about the locations of the soldiers which Negan sketches out. Ezekiel approaches Negan and asks for the map, but Negan spots 
Annie
 nearby and, ignoring Ezekiel, approaches 
Roberts
 and offers to pick up a couple of extra shifts so that his wife can have her workload loosened. Negan appeals to Roberts personally who appears to consider it before they are interrupted by 
Sanborn
. After being told that Negan is mouthing off, Sanborn decides that they need to show him his place and hits Negan with the butt of his 
rifle
. Negan attacks Sanborn, but he is knocked to the ground by Roberts and kicked in the gut. Seeing her husband's predicament, Annie rushes in to intervene and shoved to the ground by Sanborn and is dragged away with him after a brief scuffle as Roberts keeps Negan from intervening at gunpoint. Hidden in the bushes nearby, a worried 
Daryl
 and 
Carol
 observe these proceedings.

In the mess hall, Ezekiel and Negan approach Tyler and Ezekiel asks him for help, reminding the young man that he stood up to Pamela in the past and wants out of there as much as they do. Tyler wants to live more, but Negan calls this barely surviving rather than living. Ezekiel suggests that their people and Tyler's can take the guards together, but Tyler reveals that they've already tried that and 
"the same thing always happens. People who shouldn't die end up dead."
 They only have two choices here: survival or death. Tyler believes that if the 
Coalition
 tries this, they will all die. Ezekiel suggests that, alternatively, they can try this and they all live and they only have each other. If they lose faith in that and the idea that they can change this if they want to, they're as good as dead anyway. Roberts and Sanborn enter and drag Negan to his feet when he refuses to go with them until they tell Negan where his wife is and leave with him. Leaving himself, Tyler tells a frustrated and concerned Ezekiel that he's on his own.

Negan and Ezekiel work together on clearing dirt off of the tracks and Ezekiel demands to know what happened with the Warden. Negan claims that he was just put on latrine duty and Ezekiel orders him not to go rogue again, they needed that map. Negan is annoyed by Ezekiel's attitude towards him, but Ezekiel makes it clear that they're not friends despite Ezekiel agreeing to build the prisoner rebellion together because Ezekiel hasn't forgotten what Negan took from him. Negan admits that he has no idea what Ezekiel's talking about, and Ezekiel reveals that his reason for hating Negan is personal: the Saviors 
murdered
 Henry's brother 
Benjamin
 whom Ezekiel considers to be his family and Negan apologizing doesn't change anything for him. Ezekiel believes that if this works and they get out of here, Negan doesn't deserve a brand-new life or to be a father. Snapping, Negan tells Ezekiel that he will be a father so Ezekiel can continue to live in the past while Negan does what he has to do for his kid.

As the prisoners lay in their bunks that night, Sanborn and several other soldiers burst in, yelling for everyone to get outside immediately. The prisoners are all led to the windmill where the soldiers shine spotlights on them and the Warden, standing in front of Ezekiel and looking at him, announces that there's a traitor in their midst, someone who thinks that he's above the rules. Roberts and another soldier lead out Negan who has admitted to spearheading a 
rebellion
, although any co-conspirators will be given the benefit of the doubt as the Warden trusts that they were not acting of their own free will. As such, only Negan will be punished, but they all need to see and remember. Annie breaks free and runs towards her husband, sobbing, but she is restrained, and Negan reassures his wife that it's alright. The Warden has Negan put on his knees in front of the windmill to be executed by a firing squad while the prisoners murmur to themselves about how they knew that Negan couldn't be trusted and was a liar and Annie pleads for her husband's life to no avail. However, before the Warden can give the order to fire, he notices Negan smirking and, unwilling to let Negan martyr himself, grabs Annie and adds her to the execution. Negan desperately pleads for the Warden to leave Annie alone and take only him, but the sadistic man is determined to make Negan feel this punishment. Ezekiel is conflicted watching this while Negan pleads with Roberts, who has a family, not to do this, causing a moment of hesitation before he proceeds.

Unwilling to allow Negan to be executed, Ezekiel moves in between the firing squad and Negan and Annie, standing in their way. A number of the other prisoners quickly follow Ezekiel's lead, including Magna, Kelly, Princess, Tyler, and 
Nabila
, creating a human wall between the soldiers and Negan and Annie. The Warden admits that he admires their bravery, but he nevertheless orders his men to shoot them all. Noticing most of the soldiers hesitating at being ordered to murder so many people, Ezekiel pleads with them that 
"you don't have to do this! This world is broken, but we don't have to be."
 Realizing that Ezekiel is right, Roberts lowers his gun and turns to the rest of the soldiers who follow his lead. Roberts turns his gun on the Warden, but Sanborn aims at him in return, causing Roberts to shoot him dead. The Warden grabs Kelly and tries to escape by using her as a hostage as Roberts and the prisoners try to stop him. However, Daryl and Connie come up from behind the Warden and Daryl stabs the Warden in the back, incapacitating him and retaking Alexandria from the Commonwealth.

Negan prepares to kill the Warden with a rock, but he's stopped by 
Rosita
. Rosita demands to know where her 
daughter
 is, but the Warden refuses to answer. Seeing Sanborn reanimate, Rosita grabs him and holds the walker over the Warden's face, once again demanding to know where her daughter is. With a smile, the Warden sadistically tells Rosita that she will lose everything, and Rosita furiously shoves the zombified Sanborn into the Warden's face which Sanborn begins devouring, killing the Warden. Rosita walks away, leaving Sanborn to eat the Warden as her friends, the soldiers and former prisoners watch in shock and horror at the brutal death.



"
Family
"


In a reclaimed 
Alexandria
, the 
Coalition
 recover their various weapons from a large crate full of weapons confiscated by the 
Commonwealth
.

In front of the windmill, 
Rosita
 passes the corpses of 
Sanborn
 and 
the Warden
, grabbing an extra clip for her gun off of Sanborn's belt. 
Gabriel
 asks 
Tyler Davis
 if there's anything that he knows that can help them find the missing children and Tyler reveals that, when he was a soldier, kids without parents would end up at the 
Commonwealth Children's Home
. However, Tyler doesn't know where it is, so he goes to get the location from the captured 
Commonwealth soldiers
 at Gabriel's request. Rosita impatiently calls for the Coalition soldiers and freed prisoners to board the Commonwealth's transport bus. 
Princess
 asks 
Magna
 if anyone actually knows how to drive a train, but Magna reassures her that one of the prisoners apparently used to be an engineer before they board the bus, with 
Kelly
, 
Connie
, 
Adrienne
 and 
Dianne
 amongst those joining them.

As 
Maggie
 loads the back of the bus, 
Negan
 asks how she plans to take out 
Pamela Milton
. Negan gets that others have their own reasons for going back to the Commonwealth, but as far as he's concerned, none of them are safe as long as Pamela's still alive which he guesses that Maggie agrees with. Negan suggests that they can take out Pamela together without the help of the others, but Maggie closes the bus door and walks away, telling Negan that 
"we're not a we."
 In front of the bus, Maggie hugs 
Hershel
 and says a tearful goodbye to her son. 
Annie
 hugs Negan from behind and orders her husband to be careful. Negan states that he always is, and Annie tells Negan to come back in one piece while she holds down the fort in Alexandria and Negan promises to do so.

Nearby, Ezekiel says goodbye to 
Nabila
, 
Aliyah
 and 
Gracie
 while 
Daryl
 promises R.J. that they will be back soon and orders him to look after Judith. However, Judith tells Daryl and 
Carol
 that she's coming too over Daryl's objections. Judith reminds her friends that this isn't the future that Carl wanted and it's not what Rick and Michonne fought for, not yet at least. What they're doing could help everyone, maybe everybody everywhere, not just them. Judith wants to be a part of making what her family believed in real. Carol recognizes that while everyone else has been focused on the present for a long time, Judith has been thinking about the future which is a good thing and something that they could all do a little more of. Daryl agrees on the condition that Judith stays right with him, and he leaves R.J. in Nabila's care while they're gone.

On the railroad tracks, the Commonwealth's train smashes a walker to bits. Inside, observed by Daryl, Carol, Maggie and Judith, Rosita pours over a map of the Commonwealth with Gabriel, telling him that once they get inside, they will move the former prisoners into hiding and, as they hopefully get Mercer on their side to take out Pamela, she and Gabriel will go to get 
Coco
 back. Gabriel notices that they're going in through the lower ward and wonders why they're not going in through 
the Estates
 instead. Rosita points out that with more money, the Estates have more patrols, meaning that they don't stand out as much in the lower wards. They're going to use an access road that will allow them to hit the children's home from behind. Gabriel smiles at Rosita and promises her that they will get Coco back which is his faith in Rosita talking and Rosita is glad that Gabriel is with her.

Negan thanks Ezekiel for saving his life from the Warden and his men and asks why Ezekiel did it. Ezekiel tells Negan that dying a martyr is too easy and Negan living to make something good out of his life will keep Ezekiel from giving in to anger over 
Benjamin
's 
murder
 by 
the Saviors
. Ezekiel doesn't want to live out whatever time he has left in bitterness, noting that he's not even supposed to be here. 
"The 
dead
 
came for me
. And yet I smile. 
War
 came for me. And yet I smile. 
Cancer
. Yet I smile. I try to, anyway. I try,"
 states Ezekiel. Ezekiel asks why Negan gave the Warden his own name rather than betraying Ezekiel and Negan explains that he did it 
"for my wife... my kid. To leave a better story about me than the one you've been telling. That when it mattered... I did something right. And it wasn't to prove anything. It wasn't to get anything in return. Hell, it wasn't even to save my own ass. It was to save all of you. You all are better than me. And if you think I don't know that... then you haven't been paying attention."
 Negan leaves while Maggie, having overheard the conversation unseen, contemplates what she has just learned.

Outside of the tunnel entrance, four Commonwealth soldiers patrol while the Coalition forces hide nearby. Negan tells the others that they are sitting ducks and Mercer isn't coming and they can't wait for him. Carol agrees that it's time for a new plan, but Princess is sure that Mercer is gonna show up. Daryl states that they're running out of time and Carol decides to head around and try to find another way to slip in. Maggie suggests that they could take the four guards, but Rosita warns her that if those guards go missing, the clock is going to start ticking on them. Judith draws the others attention as one of the guards notices something and starts heading their way. However, Lieutenant Rose calls in with orders from Mercer for the guards to report to the East Gate immediately to deal with the incoming herd. Lieutenant Rose confirms that that includes Tunnel H and he reassures the soldiers that the tunnel is locked, and they've got it covered on the other end. Complying with his orders, the guards move out. Breaking the lock on the door, the group makes their way into the tunnel.

The Coalition forces emerge from the tunnel in the seemingly-abandoned Union Station. Daryl quickly deduces that something isn't right, and he notices that the outer doors are all chained shut. Realizing that it's a trap, Daryl yells for everyone to get down as Pamela's private forces, situated on the station's balcony, open fire, killing Tyler and two former prisoners standing near him as everyone else dives for cover.

A gunfight erupts between Pamela's forces and the Coalition with Rosita desperately trying to get the doors open. One Alexandria resident crawls towards a hiding Connie, Kelly, Magna and Dianne, but he is shot in the head and killed by one of Pamela's men before he can reach them. As the gunfight continues, Pamela herself emerges and grabs a 
gun
 from one of her men who is killed by the Coalition. Pamela takes aim at Maggie, but Judith notices and shoves Maggie out of the way just in time, saving her life. Instead, Pamela accidentally shoots Judith, seriously wounding the young girl. Daryl desperately attends to Judith as Pamela watches in horror and the others increase their fire, killing a few more of Pamela's men. Yelling that 
"you did this,"
 Pamela retreats to her office. Looking for a way out, Daryl spots a 
fire extinguisher
 near Ezekiel and signals him to throw it. Grabbing Rick's Colt Python from Judith, Daryl shoots the fire extinguisher, creating a smokescreen.

In Union Square, 
Yumiko
 and 
Max
 observe the heavily guarded doors to Union Station from across the street. Hearing twigs snapping, Yumiko spots a hooded 
Eugene
 sneaking around a train car, armed with 
Brooks
' rifle and she tells Max that they are going to go around. Inside, under cover of the smokescreen, Daryl and the others manage to break the chains sealing a side door. As a trooper approaches the doors, Eugene ambushes him and knocks the man out with the butt of his rifle. Magna finally breaks through the doors, and everyone is reunited with Eugene, Yumiko and Max before quickly making their escape.

The Coalition races through the streets towards the 
hospital
 with Daryl carrying the unconscious Judith. Commonwealth vehicles drive up and block their path in multiple directions, forcing them to fall back. Carol realizes that the soldiers aren't following them as they begin to erect barricades in the streets. Loudly yelling and firing their guns in the air, Commonwealth soldiers lead the herd in their direction before closing the barricades, penning the herd and the Coalition in. Spotting a walker climbing over something, a shocked Negan asks 
"what the fuck?"
 As walkers close in from multiple directions, 
Luke
 and 
Jules
 emerge from the herd, causing Kelly to nearly shoot them before Connie stops her sister. Fleeing down a side street, Carol spots an alley near part of the herd and everyone attacks the walkers, clearing a path for Daryl to flee down the alley towards the hospital with Judith. Waking up for a moment, Judith calls out 
"daddy?"
 and witnesses her friends and loved ones struggling to hold back the herd before passing out again.



"
Rest in Peace
"


In the streets, the 
Coalition
 desperately fights off the 
herd
 as they try to escape from the walkers swarming around them, those armed with guns shooting the undead while the rest stab at them with knives, including 
Max
. However, 
Jules
 misses the head of one walker, instead stabbing it in the shoulder. The walker bites Jules in the arm and 
Luke
 rushes to his girlfriend's aid, stabbing the walker in the head and yelling for help as he supports Jules. However, walkers swarm the couple from behind with one tackling Luke to the ground and biting him in the leg as Jules is dragged down and devoured. Seeing Luke's predicament, 
Connie
 shoots the walker in the head and Luke is dragged to safety by 
Kelly
 and 
Yumiko
, yelling in desperation for his girlfriend as Jules is devoured, beyond the ability of any of her friends to try to save her. Shooting at a smaller group of walkers coming down an alleyway, 
Carol
 orders her friends to follow her down it and everyone flees as the herd overruns the streets.

At the 
police station
, 
Mercer
, Ezekiel, Max, 
Princess
 and 
Dianne
 load supplies onto a truck while 
Maggie
 loads a 
sniper rifle
. 
Negan
 asks if Maggie intends to use it on Pamela and states that his offer to her still stands, but Maggie refuses. The herd begins to approach the police station and Maggie tells the others that they have to go. Mercer raises his gun to shoot at the walkers, but Ezekiel stops him, recognizing 
Aaron
 and 
Lydia
 walking amongst the herd, 
covered in walker guts
. Ezekiel runs to help the injured Lydia, asking about 
Jerry
 and 
Elijah
, but Aaron tells him that they're still out there. As the herd overruns the police station, the group loads up onto the truck with Aaron promising to fill everyone else in on the way. The group drives off to meet up with the others at the hospital. Ezekiel later radios in that they've got Mercer and asks for any updates on the kids. 
Gabriel
 reports the good news and Ezekiel promises to see them at the hospital.

At night, outside of a loading dock, Mercer observes a crowd of desperate Commonwealth residents demanding to be let into the Estates. Mercer reassures Maggie that they will be able to move soon while Aaron tells Ezekiel that he saw people on the higher floors and rooftops begging for help, but he wanted to make sure that Lydia was safe first. Ezekiel reassures his friend that he did the right thing. Hearing screams in the distance, both men are determined to do more, but they need to take care of Judith first. Lieutenant 
Rose
 arrives in another truck and reports to Mercer that they're all set: everyone is in the back and there's no one to check. The doctors have set up a safe house, but they have to hurry. Mercer calls for everyone to go, stating that they need to get Judith to 
Tomi
. Everyone boards the truck with Princess, Max and Dianne pushing Judith's stretcher.

At the safe house, suddenly, there's shouts outside and two gunshots. Looking outside, Mercer sees a man trying to climb the wall, only to be shot by Commonwealth soldiers on Pamela's orders. Mercer tells the others that the soldiers are shooting anyone that climbs the gates and grabs a gun, unwilling to just stand by as people are dying. Mercer informs the Coalition members that the truck is gassed up with enough reserves in the rear to get them home. Mercer and his men can sneak them out the back as Mercer believes that this isn't their fight or their people. 
"Yes, they are. And so are you,"
 states Ezekiel. Addressing the others, Ezekiel tells them that 
"you may not think this place is worth saving, and I get that, given how they treated us. But it's worth it to me. The people are worth it, and I'm not gonna allow them to fall without a fight. Not today. I'm with you. Who else?"
 Aaron immediately agrees, stating that they can do more than just save themselves and they need to. Following Ezekiel's lead, everyone agrees to fight to save the Commonwealth.

At the gates of the Estates, the crowd desperately begs Pamela to be let in, amongst them 
Mr. Martens
, 
Mrs. Martens
 and 
Mei
. On a balcony, Maggie lines up her shot on Pamela, but Negan tells her to hold on as Mercer and his loyalist forces move in, ordering Colonel 
Vickers
 and her men to lower their weapons. Pamela orders Vickers to arrest them, but the Coalition forces join Mercer's troops from another angle, creating a standoff. Pamela accuses Mercer of being a traitor, but Mercer states that she's the true traitor and lists Pamela's crimes: disappearing hundreds of citizens, leading the dead to their doorstep, shooting a child and now leaving thousands to die.

The banging on the gates grows more frantic as the herd begins to approach the Estates, meaning that the people will die if they're not let inside. Gabriel moves towards the gates despite Vickers orders to stop. Gabriel announces that they're opening the gate and letting everyone inside, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him. Vickers threatens to shoot him, but Carol warns her that they will fire back if she does. Pamela orders her men to shoot Gabriel as he reaches the gates and one of them points a gun at his head. Suddenly, Daryl yells for them to stop. 
"What the hell you doing?"
 Daryl demands. 
"We all deserve better than this. You built this place to be like the old world. That was the fuckin' problem."
 Pamela states that if she opens the gates, the dead will get in too, not just the living. Daryl tells her that if she doesn't, Pamela will lose everything anyway. 
"We got one enemy. We ain't the walking dead."


Realizing that Daryl is right, Vickers orders everyone to lower their weapons and give Gabriel the key to the gates. Everyone stands down and Vickers defers to Mercer's command who places Pamela under arrest for high crimes against the people of the Commonwealth. As everyone rushes to help let the people in, Maggie informs Negan that Pamela is getting arrested and Negan tells her that prison is a fate worse than death for someone like Pamela, causing Maggie to relent in shooting her.

The crowd rushes in just in the nick of time, amongst them Jerry and Elijah, before the gates are closed, keeping out the herd. Elijah reunites with a relieved Lydia while Jerry desperately looks for his family before Ezekiel reassures his friend that they're safe back in 
Alexandria
 and that they will get back out there to help the people that still need their help. Approaching the gates, Pamela notices a zombified 
Lance Hornsby
, Carol's arrow still in his neck, at the front of the herd, reaching through the gates. Pamela approaches Lance, baring her neck and intending to have Lance bite her as a form of 
suicide
. Judith begs Pamela not to go through with it as it's never too late and they have to help everyone still out there. Before Lance can bite Pamela, Maggie shoots him in the head with her sniper rife, putting Lance down. Maggie states that it's time to take the Commonwealth back.

With the variants being too dangerous to just lead away, Mercer outlines a new plan as everyone rushes to carry out his orders. As they need to get a vehicle out of the Estates, a mixture of Coalition forces, Commonwealth soldiers and Commonwealth residents, led by Aaron, rush out of the Estates, armed with melee weapons and riot shields with the aim of drawing the herd away and clearing a path, although Mercer warns them not to engage the walkers more than absolutely necessary. Working together, the group holds the line against the herd while Mercer calls in that the vehicle is out of the back gate and on its way to the town square, asking them to let him know when they're clear. Magna reports that they've diverted the walkers and its clear as it's going to get, ordering them to move out. As the combined group continues to fight the walkers, the truck by through the cleared path to the fuel depot where Vickers, Ezekiel, Jerry, Dianne and several Commonwealth soldiers collect the fuel. Max reports in that they've got fuses running to the private sewers under the Estates and they'll finish wiring the rest once they get the fuel back while Princess goes to start the PA system to draw all of the walkers to the Estates.

Using Pamela's record player, the song "Cult of Personality" is blasted throughout the Commonwealth from the Estates, drawing all of the walkers overrunning the Commonwealth towards it. Elijah helps set up speakers throughout the Estates as Jerry, Ezekiel and Lydia pour fuel down into the sewers and the walkers fighting the forces outside of the Estates begin moving towards it as well. Mercer brings out some dynamite which Eugene and Yumiko help to wire up to drums of fuel placed throughout the Estates and Connie helps to wire up more speakers, unharmed by the loud music due to her deafness. As Max helps to coordinate the efforts, Mercer calls in that they're prepared to open the gates and to let him know when they're ready. Max calls in that they're good to go before she joins the others in retreating to the rendezvous point, the two women acknowledging that they're dead if this plan fails. The gates are opened and the herd floods into the Estates. Once the song ends, the fuses connected to explosives inside of Pamela's house are ignited, detonating the fuel in a chain reaction that obliterates the Estates and the entire herd, saving the Commonwealth.

In Alexandria, everyone enjoys a celebration and feast, joined by Mercer, Max and Tomi. Judith gives 
Dog
 some of her food and Yumiko raises a toast to Luke. Looking out the window, Daryl sees Negan walking away and the two men exchange a smile and a nod, parting on good terms. Yumiko turns to Magna, telling her 
"same"
 and Magna kisses her, the two women resuming their romantic relationship. Sitting down, Rosita smiles as she watches the celebration before becoming somber. Noticing Rosita's somber mood, Gabriel joins her, and Rosita tells him that she just wants to remember this perfect moment. In a whisper, Rosita reveals her bite and impending death to Gabriel. Noticing Rosita's behavior and crying, Judith realizes that something's wrong with her and becomes upset, apparently deducing the truth.

A year later, Eugene visits a memorial plaque for those lost in the walker invasion bearing Luke, Jules, Rosita, and 
Marissa Berot
's names and lays down flowers for his lost friends before pressing a kiss to Rosita's name. Eugene joins Max, who is now his wife, and takes their daughter 
Rosie
 from her and puts Rosie in her stroller. Ezekiel, now the governor of the Commonwealth with Mercer as his deputy governor, gives a speech attended by Eugene, Max, Princess, Daryl Judith, Kelly, Connie, Magna and Yumiko amongst many others, the latter two now happily married to each other. When Ezekiel introduces Mercer as his deputy governor, Princess loudly cheers for her boyfriend, much to the amusement of Ezekiel, Mercer and the crowd.

At the side of the road, Judith, R.J. and Ezekiel join Daryl and Carol as he prepares to depart on his motorcycle. Daryl hugs the kids and R.J. promises him that he will be good while Judith promises to keep an eye on Dog for him. Daryl asks Judith to keep an eye on Carol and promises her that if he sees or hears anything about Rick and Michonne while he's out there, he will find them both and bring them home. Calling him Uncle Daryl, Judith states that Daryl deserves a happy ending too and Daryl promises to come back. Daryl hugs Ezekiel goodbye and he leads the kids to the top of the wall to watch Daryl's departure. Daryl and Carol hug and admit that they love each other before Daryl drives off on his motorcycle through the Commonwealth gate, setting off through the countryside on his 
new journey
.

Trivia
[
]


The casting call for this character used the name 
Augustus

Ezekiel was described as "Late 40s. African American. An eccentric, charismatic, and kind leader. He projects a regal air of confidence and wisdom to his people, and he enjoys the respect they give him because of it. To an outsider, his deliberate dress and mannerisms might seem theatrical, and to a degree, they are."


Just like his comic counterpart, Ezekiel's signature weapon is a cane called 
Shikomizue
