Overview


Gage initially appears to be a friendly teenager, inviting 
Henry
 to hang out with him, 
Addy
, and 
Rodney
. However, he is also quite troublesome and immature, shown when he and Rodney begin playing with a 
walker
 outside of the walls. After the death of his friends, Gage becomes vengeful against the 
Whisperers
. He begins bullying 
Lydia
, a former Whisperer, to the point of ambushing her at night with 
Margo
 and 
Alfred
. When confronted by the 
council
 about this, he is shown to be a liar, saying that Lydia was the one who attacked them. He is also quite cowardly, shown when he abandons the group in the 
subway tunnel
. 

Despite his faults, Gage was just a teenager whose life was cut short due to the apocalypse. Gage did genuinely care for his friends. His main motivation for bullying Lydia being him blaming her for their deaths. He notably hesitates before beating her up, but joins in after being reminded of his friends. His lack of maturity could be due to not having anyone there for him to help lead him in the right direction. He most likely became friends with Margo and Alfred since they all could relate to having lost someone to the Whisperers. However, Margo and Alfred might've also acted as a bad influence on Gage, seeing as they are adults while Gage is just a teenager. The two went along with Gage's bullying and pushed him into beating up Lydia. 

After Margo and Alfred's deaths, Gage attempts to do some good by going with the group on the dangerous mission to 
Meridian
. However, most of the group members don't seem to care much for Gage. This is most prominently shown when Gage is trapped in a subway train and only 
Alden
 and 
Negan
 attempt to save him. However 
Maggie
 tells the group to not save him since they don't have enough ammo to clear the walkers. Gage begins to beg to be let in, promising he'll be better, but Maggie still refuses. Not wanting to feel the pain of being devoured, Gage kills himself.



Pre-Apocalypse


Location Unknown

"


Outside the Hilltop's walls, Gage practices defense moves with 
Addy
 as part of his training to become a member of the Hilltop's guard under 
Kal
's instruction and supervision.



"
Evolution
"


Upon noticing a solitary 
Henry
 eating away from the other residents, Gage and his friends call him to talk with them. He recognizes him from the war and shortly after, they invite him to hang with them in the woods. 

That night, Henry drinks with his new friends in a shed outside of Hilltop. Gage suggests they have some more fun and takes them to a covered hole in the ground with a 
walker
 inside. Addy leaves as they throw rope rings at it and 
Rodney
 pees on it. Henry jumps in and mercy kills the walker. Gage is pissed at Henry for being a buzzkill and leaves him there.



"
Chokepoint
"


Gage is part of 
Tara
's group in charge of clearing a tree from their path to the 
Kingdom
 to ensure the roads are cleared for 
Alden
's convoy carrying the food and trade goods for the fair. Upon finding a downed tree, Gage remains alert and checks the surrounding area. He keeps on watch as the others help chop the tree into pieces to clear the road.

Later that day, a small herd of walkers approaches the group. They get in position and remind themselves to watch for the 
Whisperers
. When Gage is attacked by a walker, Addy rushes in and saves him. Suddenly, the 
Highwaymen
 ride up on horses and introduce themselves to Tara after helping to take down the herd. They then escort them to the Kingdom, having accepted 
Carol
's deal. Upon arriving at the Kingdom, Gage excitedly looks around with Addy and Rodney.



"
The Calm Before
"


Gage watches from the crowd as 
Ezekiel
 declares they've finally accomplished 
Rick
, 
Carl
, and 
Jesus
' dreams of reuniting the communities. 
"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!"
 Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. 

When Addy talks with Henry nearby, Gage and Rodney introduce themselves to 
Lydia
 and tell her that Addy has a thing for Henry, making her uncomfortable. However, she throws goat feces at them as payback. Later that day, Gage asks around for Rodney's and Addy's whereabouts.

The next day, Gage listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news about the fate of the missing fair attendees, tells them how brave the victims were in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them.



Season 10


"
Lines We Cross
"


Some months after the blizzard, Gage is among the coalition members drafted into the militia that was formed in response to the Whisperer threat. He and the other militia conduct a training exercise on the 
Oceanside
 beach. As Ezekiel and 
Jerry
 methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Gage and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat.  

They are successful and return to Oceanside to rest, eat, and socialize with the Oceansiders. That night, Gage helps put out the fire that was ignited in the woods in Whisperer territory after a satellite from outer space crashes. 



"
Ghosts
"


Gage, alongside the coalition soldiers and Alexandria residents, faces against waves of walkers pouring onto the community gates over the next 49 hours. At first, Gage and 
Laura
 are dispatched to take care of a small group of walkers. After the exhausting battle, Gage celebrates by fooling around with his weapon as he and Laura share a laugh. However, they soon notice more incoming walkers and Laura radios back to the community that a new herd of walkers is approaching from multiple directions. In the morning, Gage helps to clean up the community from the corpses while 
Eugene
 warns that it will be an hour until the next wave hits. 

Later that day at an emergency council meeting in Alexandria, Gage demands to 
Michonne
 that they should put the Whisperers' heads on pikes. Michonne tells the residents that attacking the Whisperers without a proper plan is not smart due to the large herd in 
Alpha
's possession. Gage then listens as Michonne tells everyone instead of retaliating, she and a small group will meet with Alpha at the border to work things out. He then continues to work alongside the Alexandrians and coalition soldiers to take out the waves of walkers for the remainder of the day.



"
Silence the Whisperers
"


Gage attends a training session in Alexandria led by 
Aaron
 but begins to taunt Lydia with a mask made out of a burlap sack when she approaches the group of soldiers. He laughs alongside 
Margo
 and 
Alfred
 when she storms away. Later that day, he is eating lunch with Margo and Alfred inside the dining hall when Lydia sits at their table and guts a squirrel, in which blood shoots onto his face. He reacts in disgust and storms away from the table.

That night, Gage and his friends ambush Lydia by the clotheslines and proceed to beat her as Margo reminds him that she is responsible for the deaths of Addy and Rodney. When 
Negan
 arrives and rescues Lydia, Gage is horrified to see that Margo was killed when she was thrown off Lydia, hitting her head against a building. Shortly thereafter, Gage and Alfred are questioned by the Alexandria council on the events that just occurred. They feed the council lies and are in disbelief when the council begins questioning their story. Eventually, both are let go.



Season 11


"
Acheron: Part I
"


Having survived the Whisperer War, Gage is part of a group consisting of Daryl, Elijah, Maggie, Carol, Alden, Rosita, Lydia, Gabriel, Jerry, Roy, Kelly, and Magna who raid the abandoned 
Fort Connors
 military base for food supplies. He remains on watch on the roof as the women make their way into a hangar by rope to collect supplies. When walkers threaten the women, Gage acts as an archer, shooting down several walkers to protect them alongside Roy, Elijah, Daryl, Alden and Jerry. After the mission, Gage returns to Alexandria with his fellow survivors.

Gage joins the mission to salvage food and water from 
Meridian
 to feed the large population in Alexandria. Part of a group consisting of Maggie, Daryl, Alden, Cole, Elijah, Roy, Negan, 
Frost
, 
Duncan
, 
Agatha
, and Gabriel, the survivors utilize Negan's familiarity with the 
D.C.
 area to travel to Meridian. Due to the 
heavy rainstorm
, the survivors are forced to head into the 
subway tunnels
 to complete the journey. While in the tunnels, they come across hundreds of body bags, many containing walkers in them. While putting down the bodies, Gage is snuck up on by a huge walker, but is saved by Negan. At some point while dispatching the body bag walkers, Gage and 
Roy
 go missing, along with the group's ammo and supplies. Shortly after this realization, a large group of walkers appear, forcing the other survivors to move forward in the tunnel without being able to search for Gage or Roy.



"
Acheron: Part II
"


Having gotten separated from Roy, Gage enters the other side of a train car where 
Maggie
, 
Gabriel
, 
Duncan
, 
Frost
, 
Agatha
, 
Alden
, and 
Negan
 are trapped. Gage yells for help from behind the stuck door, explaining that he and Roy had gotten lost in the walker-filled tunnels and he was able to get a door open on the far end of the train. Gabriel asks if Gage closed the door behind him just as walkers begin to fill Gage's side of the train from the door that he'd forgotten to close. As Negan tries to open the door for Gage, Maggie warns everybody that if they open it, all of the walkers will get in and they don't have the ammo to clear them out. Alden tries anyways, but Duncan pulls him back and refuses to let Alden try. As the 
herd
 approaches him, Gage desperately apologizes and begs Maggie for another chance, but she refuses, insistent that they don't have the ammo to clear the walkers behind Gage. When Alden rushes the door, Cole, Frost and Duncan hold him back and Gabriel orders Alden to let it go. Maggie apologizes to Gage for being unable to help him, but he angrily calls her a liar. Drawing two knives as the herd is about to overtake him and glaring straight at Maggie, Gage stabs himself twice in the heart, putting himself into shock, much to the horror of his friends. As Gage goes limp, the walkers grab him from behind and begin devouring his corpse, Gage's eyes still open and staring straight at his companions as he's eaten.

Shortly thereafter, Gage's mutilated corpse reanimates and Negan and Gabriel have trouble looking at him. Gabriel calls walker Gage 
"the shell of a man who died a coward."
 Alden insists that Gage was only scared and didn't deserve to die 
"in the worst way imaginable."
 This prompts Maggie to tell a story from her time alone with 
Hershel
 of a worse way to die than Gage did.

Eventually, the press of Gage and the other walkers causes the door separating the two train cars to start to come down. Finally, the door breaks down and the zombified Gage leads the herd through. As Gage comes through the door, Gabriel shoots him in the head with a shotgun, putting down Gage and the two walkers behind him.
