Garcia is seen near Eugene , Ezekiel , Princess , and Yumiko as they argue over getting out. Garcia is one of the many troopers named by Princess, who has been observing different troopers, and she explains after naming Sorensen that he doesn't like Garcia, who has bladder problems, and that she would always ask him if she could take a pee break when they were driving there. Garcia is among the soldiers protecting the Estates as the Commonwealth is overrun by the herd . When the Coalition and Mercer 's loyal troops arrive, they enter into a standoff with Garcia and the rest of his squad. However, he eventually lowers his weapon on Vickers ' orders. [1]",
