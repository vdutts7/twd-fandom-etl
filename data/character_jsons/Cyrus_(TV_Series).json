        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Sometime in the early days of the outbreak, Cyrus took shelter in an abandoned warehouse within or near Baltimore. Cyrus is among the survivors inside a shelter, alongside Dee and her family. As survivors listen to an emergency broadcast, he stands nearby with his arms folded, leaning up against a pillar that reads \"23 days\", indicating how long they've been inside. Nine days later, Cyrus listens to another emergency broadcast alongside Rose , Amanda , Frank , Lamar , and Matias , and discusses about venturing outside to gather supplies. Cyrus gathers his things to prepare for the supply run as Dee is eager to leave with them, but her husband maintains that they stay put. After 43 days, it is revealed that Cyrus and the others never made it back to the shelter, indicating they possibly died amidst the chaos in the streets of Baltimore or fled to the countryside leaving their fates unknown.",
