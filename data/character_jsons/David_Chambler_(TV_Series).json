David once served in a war and worked as a Gorbelli's food truck driver. At some point before the outbreak, he was diagnosed with lung cancer . When he first heard about the outbreak, he was working and managed to pick up Meghan, Lilly, and Tara before barricading them inside of an apartment building in a small town.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Lilly mentioned to the Governor , at this time known as the pseudonym Brian Heriot , that, when the outbreak first began, David drove his food truck to pick-up his daughters and granddaughter from their work and school and the family was able to survive off of the non-perishable foods that were in David's truck at the time. Following the apocalypse, David lived with his daughters Tara and Lilly, and his granddaughter, Meghan. He had lung cancer and was not expected to live as long as he had. He died in bed at home. Due to their seclusion and consequent inexperience with walkers, his daughters were not aware that everyone turns regardless of the cause of death, so he turned and attacked Tara. The Governor put him down. After that, they buried his body and left the apartment.",
