        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point during the outbreak, Howell joined a community in Ohio. Howell is seen in the Commonwealth station. He is assigned with McHugh to Sector C by Colonel Vickers . He listens to Sebastian bragging about his skills in fighting walkers. He chuckles with McHugh when Daryl sarcastically claps for him. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Howell's fate is left unknown. It is possible he was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",
