        "Overview[]": "Unlike most of his fellow Saviors who tend to have a rough and often volatile nature, Alden is level-headed and tends to avoid violence and bloodbaths if he can help it, shown when he immediately surrendered to the Militia and talked his fellow men into doing the same instead of starting more bloodshed. In the makeshift prison at Hilltop, he deliberately bumped Jared and told him to not cause any more trouble after already risking their lives twice with escape attempts. Alden appeared to take up a leadership role with the Savior prisoners, attempting to negotiate with Maggie on their behalf. In return, Maggie appeared to treat Alden as the leader of the prisoners and showed him a level of respect that many of the others didn't receive. As he spends more time as a prisoner of the Militia , Alden becomes more and more disillusioned with the Saviors. After Simon shows no care for the prisoners, Alden cuts all ties with the Saviors and states that the Saviors aren't his people anymore when sent to bury the dead Saviors. Alden's disillusionment goes so far that he chooses to stay at the Hilltop willingly rather than return to the Saviors when given the chance despite knowing that the Saviors' lack of care towards the prisoners means that he no longer has any strategic value to the Militia. Months later, Alden is shown to be a prominent figure within the communities, to the point of voicing his opinions to Rick . He is shown to be helpful, easy-going, and brave. He is now a completely trusted member of the group, becoming an apprentice with Earl and entering a relationship with Enid . However, he becomes vengeful against the Whisperers after they killed Enid. He is shown to be somewhat hypocritical, treating Lydia and Gamma harshly due to being former Whisperers, even though he was once in a similar position as a former Savior. He eventually loses his grudge against Gamma after seeing her affection for her nephew . Alden is shown to still retain his humanity, as he was one of only two people to attempt to save Gage . He is angered when the group lets Gage die. When he is badly injured, he is shown to care more about the people of Alexandria 's lives more than his own. Not wanting to slow the group down, he stays behind in a church. By the time, Maggie returns for him, he is already dead. Maggie is shown to be greatly saddened by his death, showing how far their friendship had come.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Nothing is known about Alden's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that he was born in 1990 and had at least one brother, and a father who was apparently not a very good parent. He appears to have an engineering or construction background as Alden was employed by the Saviors to determine what it would take to turn an abandoned bar into an outpost and to figure out a way to reinforce their defenses at the Satellite Outpost .",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At an unknown point, Alden's brother was murdered. Alden took revenge on the killers, but it didn't make him feel better as he expected. Alden eventually joined the Saviors as a worker. At some point, he was sent to check out an abandoned dive bar located between the Sanctuary and the Hilltop to determine what it would take to turn it into a Savior outpost. Alden apparently determined that it was impossible to turn the bar into an outpost as it was left abandoned by the Saviors. Some time after the Satellite Outpost was ambushed by Rick and the Alexandrians, Alden was among the Saviors dispatched to the outpost to erect a fence surrounding the satellite station, to keep out walkers and any future invaders.",
        "Death[]": "Killed By Pope (Caused, Alive) Bossie (Caused, Alive) Montanio (Alive) After being severely wounded by Bossie , Alden was found by Montanio. He then had his legs broken and throat slit, but managed to kill the other man at the same time. Alden then reanimated following the fight.
