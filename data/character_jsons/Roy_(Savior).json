Roy is at the marketplace and steps in during a confrontation between a worker and a vendor. He and his fellow Saviors then proceed to beat the worker to death after he gets violent. Roy accompanies Simon and numerous other Saviors to the Hilltop to get Dr. Harlan Carson since their own doctor, Emmett Carson , was killed by Negan. Roy attempts to enter the cellar where Daryl and Maggie are hiding, but is distracted by Enid who asks him if he can take a bucket of vegetables to the Saviorsâ€™ truck. He refuses and demands that she does it herself, and proceeds to enter the cellar to take more supplies, but he fails to notice Daryl and Maggie and so leaves the cellar. He then leaves the Hilltop with his fellow Saviors. Roy is among the Saviors traveling with Negan to Alexandria .
