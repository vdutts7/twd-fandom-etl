        "Abraham Ford": "Abraham Ford",
        "Overview[]": "Abraham is a reckless and brave survivor with a short temper and an equally profound wittiness. He was traumatized by the death of his family, which left him a broken man suffering from PTSD and recklessly suicidal tendencies. At the crux of his conflict: finding what it means to truly live. Despite his violent tendencies, Abraham is wise and thoughtful. At his best, he is providing insightful advice and council to his friends, lightening the mood, and pondering the future of mankind. At his worst, he is \"grabbing the bull by the nut sack\" and plunging himself into peril hoping for the thrill to provide him meaning. He is a living juxtaposition between recklessness and wisdom. In the end, he concludes that truly living is sacrificing for a future. Despite his rough, brash nature, Abraham greatly enjoys having fun, which he can find in killing walkers or admittedly, fighting other people, as noted by Tara Chambler , he smiles while killing the undead. His fun-loving side can also be seen in his evident sense of humor and peculiar choices of profanity, his most prominent personality quirk. He also loves alcohol and does not like to socialize. In Season 4 , during his first appearance, Abraham appears to be a rather hostile survivor. That can be shown after saving the lives of Glenn Rhee and Tara from walkers, as he tells Glenn that he should give up looking for his wife Maggie Rhee , pointing that she's probably dead by now and that helping him bring Eugene Porter to Washington, D.C. to save the whole world is a way more important mission than trying to save his wife. His statement causes a huge fight between the two men, with Abraham almost choking Glenn to death. However, after Eugene breaks down the group's truck, Abraham agrees to travel alongside Glenn and Tara, in their mission to find Maggie and then head to Washington. After they finally find Maggie and her group, Eugene manages to convince Abraham to go to Terminus with the others, as they might be able to obtain supplies and recruit others at Terminus to come to Washington. In the road, Abraham and Glenn eventually become close allies and friends. During Season 5 , after Rick's group escapes from the Terminus, Abraham's original mission continues to be the same; bringing Eugene to Washington, in order to find the cure for the outbreak. His obsession with this mission causes fights with his fellow survivors. At first, he is arguing with Rick Grimes about the mission he has on his shoulders, with Rick telling him that he's not going anywhere without his missing people and with Abraham responding that he tries to save not only the group's, but everyone's lives. However, on time processing Rick and the group agree to go to Washington with Abraham and he and Rick finally become friends. After Eugene lies to him about knowing the cure, Abraham becomes a broken man and thinks that everything is over, at least for a while. When he and the group arrive to Alexandria Safe Zone , where he becomes head of the construction crew, Abraham tries to return to his normal life, after he realizes that he could actually make a new life there. After a while, Abraham forgives Eugene and tries to become friends with him once again. By the start of Season 6 , while he initially seems to adjust to being in the Alexandria Safe Zone, Abraham's PTSD worsens during the quarry plan, as he begins to show suicidal tendencies, by taking on walkers that are splitting off from the herd. These tendencies also causes him to risk his life, either by falling or by being bitten, by trying to get an RPG that was stuck with a hanging walker, and his frustrations leads to him screaming at the walker. He is greatly intrigued by the prospect of starting a new family, both to carry on humanity and get through his funk. With time passing, Abraham slowly starts to have a love interest about Sasha Williams and he later decides that he actually wanted to make a relationship with her all this time. Eventually, he breaks up with Rosita Espinosa , as he truly wants to be with Sasha and maybe even make a family with her. Even in the face of death, even if it is going to be a slow and painful death, Abraham is shown to be absolutely fearless and defiant when Negan Smith executes him by smashing his head multiple times with his baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, \" Lucille \". In his final moments, Abraham dies a noble and courageous man who makes his final humorous words to his murderer, \"Suck... my... nuts.\"",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Abraham grew up in Houston, Texas, although little is known about his early childhood. At a young age, he enlisted into the U.S Military where he most presumably served in the middle-east, and through his years of service, he eventually gained the rank of Sergeant. [1] At one point Abraham alongside several of his comrades found themselves stranded in the desert (approximately 30 kilometres apart from their base) which had been caused by a camel which had digested their transport keys, to their relief, the animal eventually defecated the keys and their squadron managed to return home. [2] Outside of his military career, Abraham grew to become a family man, where he met a woman named Ellen where the two fell in love and became married, together the pair had two children named A.J. and Becca . The four lived together as a typical family, located in Houston, Texas where they attended several country fairs as well as a goat rodeo. [3] It is hinted however that due to Abraham's war-time experiences, he gradually molded into an incredibly brutal and malicious man and thus his aggressive demeanor heavily strained the relationship between him and his family a great deal, and thus they secretly became fearful of him. [4]",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "After the onset of the outbreak, Abraham was present with his family alongside several of their neighbors in Houston where together they holed themselves up inside a local grocery store. However upon returning from a supply run, Abraham discovered that his once trusted comrades had raped his wife in his absence, causing Abraham to brutally retaliate, (killing four men in the process.) This event was witnessed by his family whom became traumatized by his actions to where eventually they decided to leave him out of fear. After reading a note left behind, Abraham desperately searched for his family until he tragically discovered that his family had been devoured by walkers on the road; devastated by the loss of his entire family Abraham swiftly attempted to commit suicide only to be fatefully alerted by Eugene Porter whom he saved from three pursuing walkers whom Eugene then proposed to him an important mission. Upon being informed (under the unknowingly false pretense) of Eugene's ability to develop a cure - this led Abraham to a regained sense of purpose and thus he personally vowed to help deliver him to their intended destination - Washington D.C. During their journey they encountered fellow survivor Althea , who interviewed them both before parting ways. Eventually at some point during their travels, the two encountered a group of survivors consisting of Rosita Espinosa , Josiah , Stephanie , Warren , Rex , Pam , Roger , Dirk , and Josephine whom were fending of against the infected, where Abraham assisted them. Impressed with their skill, Abraham recruited them into their group and agreed to fulfill their mission to deliver Eugene to Washington. Over time Abraham and Rosita developed a romantic relationship with each other, throughout their journey through Houston to Georgia they gradually lost group members one-by-one until Rosita was the sole member left from her original group.",
        "Death[]": "Killed By Rick Grimes (Indirectly Caused) While trying to get Maggie to the Hilltop for medical attention, the group is ambushed by the Saviors and they're forced to line up. Their leader, Negan, taunts them and informs them of the 'new world order.' He tells them he will choose one member of the group to kill in retribution for the Saviors that the group, lead by Rick, had killed. Negan Smith Negan cruelly chooses Abraham after a final selection, bashing his head with his baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, which he nicknames \"Lucille\", but not before he discreetly flashes Sasha a peace sign aware of his fate. Abraham manages to survive the first of Negan's blows and musters his last words, \"Suck... my... nuts\", before he eventually succumbs to another violent strike on the head. Negan then continues beating Abraham until there is nothing recognizable left of him.",
        "Killed Victims[]": "This list shows the victims Abraham has killed: Ellen Ford (Indirectly Caused) A.J. Ford (Indirectly Caused) Becca Ford (Indirectly Caused) Greg Pete Anderson (Caused) Reg Monroe (Before Reanimation) Young Boy (Zombified, alongside his fellow Alexandrians) 4 unnamed survivors 4 unnamed Saviors (2 alongside Sasha ) Possibly numerous unnamed enemy combatants (Pre-Apocalypse) Numerous counts of zombies and possibly unnamed people",
        "Appearances[]": "",
        "Trivia[]": "The casting call for this character used the name John Tyler . [6] Abraham was described as \"Early 30s. He is vulgar with rough edges but wise.\" John Tyler is the full name of the 10th U.S. President. Abraham is the first name of the 16th U.S. President and Ford is the last name of the 38th U.S. President. Michael Cudlitz stated about his character: \"Abraham is someone who comes with a lot of emotional baggage. And heâ€™s on a mission.\" Abraham has been noted for his unique catchphrases and amusing choices of profanity. 'When you were pouring the Bisquick... Were you trying to make pancakes?' 'Son of a dick.' 'Oh, honey, look at you. You're a damn mess!' 'Maybe I'll let you shave me down all over, dolphin smooth.' 'I don't give a monkey's left nut!' 'We don't give two short and curlies what it looks like.' 'We take a breath, we slow down, shit inevitably goes down.' 'Ain't a damned corner of this damned earth that hasn't been dicked hard beyond all damned recognition!' 'The plan just got dicked.' 'I'm about ready to tear the world a brand-new asshole.' 'How long you think Rick and Michonne been uggin' bumplies?' 'Mother Dick.' 'There is a vast ocean of shit, that you people don't known shit about. Rick knows every fine grain of said shit and then some.' 'You know how to bite a dick, Eugene. I mean that with the utmost respect.' 'Make room for my freckled ass!' 'Loose ends make my ass itch.' 'We got a shit storm behind Door A and a storm of shit behind Door B.' 'I will not lie down. I will not abase. I will not give up the ship.' 'You'd have better luck picking up a turd by its clean end.' 'What the bitch?' 'Bitch nuts.' 'Why are Dingleberries brown? Just the way shit is.' 'Nibble on that.' 'I'm fit as a damn fiddle.' 'Just grabbing the bull by the nut sack.' 'We are neck-deep up shit creek with our mouths wide open!' 'Suck... My... Nuts.' Abraham is one of the few characters in the TV Series to be left-handed. Abraham's most used weapon was an M16A1 Rifle which he used until the Saviors stole it from him. Abraham has proven to be the physically strongest member of Rick's group as demonstrated by single-handedly killing four survivors (beating one of them with a soup can), almost beating Eugene to death whilst fending off against Glenn and Tara simultaneously, easily pinning down Glenn, subduing Pete , and swiftly repelling Rick. Also, he managed to survive and remain conscious after the first hit in the head by Negan 's baseball bat \" Lucille \", and Abraham didn't display any painful reaction as he stands up straight and mutters to Negan \"Suck... my... nuts.\" before finally dying after being hit by Lucille a second time. Negan even stated that Abraham was \"taking it like a champ\" after the first blow, showing how tough Abraham was. Abraham appears to have a fondness for alcohol as shown in \" Them \", where he drinks a whole bottle of whiskey. In \" Forget \", he was easily attracted to beer at the party to the point where by late evening he became drunk. Abraham has often shown signs of PTSD or at least some major psychological issues, likely due to the loss of his entire family. This can be noted when he nearly commits suicide almost immediately upon discovering their deaths and through his occasional bursts of extreme anger and mental instability (interestingly Abraham has stated that he likes to fight, and sometimes smiles once engaged in combat as noted by Tara). As of Abraham's death, all of the Ford family is now deceased. Abraham is the second main character to be killed in a season finale, the first being Andrea Harrison , the third being his girlfriend Sasha Williams , and the fourth being Rosita Espinosa . Michael Cudlitz speculates that Abraham wasn't randomly chosen but rather Negan intended to kill him because of his lack of fear towards him, and perceived him as a threat. This speculation is later proven to be correct in \" Wrath \" when Negan admits his \"Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe\" game wasn't random and that he chose to kill Abraham. Abraham is the only character to technically die in two different seasons. While not revealed, he is killed in the Season 6 finale . His death is shown in full during the Season 7 premiere . Abraham is the last character to die in Season 6 . Before being bludgeoned by Negan, Abraham discretely made his \"peace sign\" to Sasha. He was not allowed to look at her due to the fact that in the season 6 POV shot, the camera was focused on Negan the whole time. In the Fear the Walking Dead episode \" No One's Gone \", one of Althea 's tapes labeled \"Abe/Doctor\" can be seen. On Talking Dead , it was confirmed to be an interview of Abraham and Eugene Porter, revealing that they encountered Althea before meeting Rick's group . TNA star Matt Morgan auditioned for the role. However he lost out to Michael Cudlitz. Abraham is the seventh main character to outlive his comic book counterpart , with the first being Shane Walsh , the second being Carol Peletier , the third being Tyreese Williams , the fourth being Beth Greene , the fifth being Judith Grimes , the sixth being Morgan Jones , the eighth being Rosita Espinosa , the ninth being Ezekiel Sutton , the tenth being Alpha , the eleventh being Gabriel Stokes , and the twelfth being Rick Grimes . Of the characters to do so and still die afterwards, Abraham outlived his counterpart for the shortest span of time, as in the comics, Abraham is killed in Issue #98, and the lineup happens two issues later in Issue #100. In the TV Series, the circumstances of Abraham's comic death happen in the episode \" Twice as Far \", only to Denise , meaning Abraham only outlived his comic counterpart by two episodes. Abraham may have been the friend to give Daniel Salazar the cigar for when times are better given Abraham's love of cigars. However, this is unconfirmed. Abraham is the sixth main character to be killed by another main character, the first being Dale Horvath , the second being Shane Walsh , the third being Merle Dixon , the fourth being Hershel Greene , the fifth being Gareth , the seventh being Glenn Rhee , the eighth being Spencer Monroe , the ninth being Simon , the tenth being Gregory , the eleventh being Enid , the twelfth being Tara Chambler , the thirteenth being Alpha , the fourteenth being Leah Shaw , and the fifteenth being Lance Hornsby . Abraham is the first named character to be killed by Negan Smith in the TV Series . Abraham appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of \" Lockdown \", \" Variant \", \" Outpost 22 \" and \" Faith \" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins. Abraham appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode \" Rest in Peace \".",
