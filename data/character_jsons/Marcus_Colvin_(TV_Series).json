He informs her that Ms. Milton often takes a liking to fellow Harvard alumni, and that despite Yumiko's insistence on not staying in the Commonwealth permanently, he's sure her first encounter with Ms. Milton will convince her otherwise. When asked about the whereabouts of her companions, Marcus tells Yumiko they're clearing out buildings for future development as punishment for their crimes. Yumiko tells Marcus that if she's expected to provide legal services for Ms. Milton and her cabinet, that she'd like to arrange a direct meeting with her as soon as possible. Marcus states that such an arrangement would be difficult given Lance 's expectations of timing. When questioned of Lance's authority, Marcus admits Lance isn't his supervisor and ultimately agrees to arrange the meeting. Marcus prosecuted Eugene Porter for the murder of Sebastian. He was successful and won the case as ruled by Judge George . With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Marcus' fate is left unknown.
