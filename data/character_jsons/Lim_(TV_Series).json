        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point during the outbreak, Lim joined a community in Ohio. Tyler tells Princess that she can see her friends now and opens the train car door and sees Eugene, Yumiko, and Ezekiel with black hoods over their heads with six soldiers standing with them, Lim being among them. Tyler then suddenly puts a hood over Princess's head and handcuffs her. Lim is seen in the Commonwealth station. He is assigned with Baker to Sector B by Colonel Vickers . Trooper Lim is one of the sixteen soldiers accompanying Lance Hornsby as he investigates the events that took place at Riverbend. He and the rest of the squad arrive at Hilltop and eventually granted entry inside to search the town for the stolen Commonwealth weapons. After no weapons are found and an intense confrontation between the Rhees and Lance, Lim and the other Commonwealth soldiers eventually leave Hilltop with their boss. That night, he and the others encounter Leah in the woods where Lance strikes up a deal with the lone Reaper. Lim is at his desk at the police station when Mercer arrives to speak with Juanita in his office. Later, he witnesses Eugene surrender himself for the death of Sebastian Milton. Lim is among the soldiers protecting the Estates as the Commonwealth is overrun by the herd . When the Coalition and Mercer 's loyal troops arrive, they enter into a standoff with Lim and the rest of his squad. However, he eventually lowers his weapon on Vickers ' orders. [1]",
