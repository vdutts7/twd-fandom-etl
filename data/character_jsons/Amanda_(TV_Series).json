        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Sometime in the early days of the outbreak, Amanda took shelter in an abandoned warehouse within or near Baltimore. Amanda is among the survivors inside a shelter, alongside Dee and her family. She and several survivors listen to an emergency broadcast over the radio, as a nearby pillar reads \"23 days\", indicating how long they've been in the shelter. Nine days later, Amanda listens to another emergency broadcast alongside Rose , Lamar , Frank , Cyrus , and Matias , and discusses about venturing outside to gather supplies. Amanda expresses that she is ready to head out and gathers her things to prepare for the supply run as Dee is eager to leave with them, but her husband maintains that they stay put. After 43 days, it is revealed that Amanda and the others never made it back to the shelter, indicating they possibly died amidst the chaos in the streets of Baltimore or fled to the countryside leaving their fates unknown.",
