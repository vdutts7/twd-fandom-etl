John is among the workers from the Sanctuary sent to Eugene 's outpost to help produce bullets for Negan's army. John is producing bullets with the other workers when he listens to Eugene's speech about meeting the minimum quota for Simon . When a soot-covered Eugene returns after his brief absence, John and the other Saviors are ordered to complete the entire bullet order in anticipation of Negan's final assault on the militia.
