        "Overview[]": "Gabriel is a deeply religious, wise, and generally well meaning, but also severely traumatized man. He is shown to have had extreme difficulty adapting to the nature of the post-apocalyptic world and instead retained his Christian faith. Gabriel was initially shown to be a coward, as instead of helping members of his congregation by giving them shelter in his church, he refused to let them in (possibly out of fear), resulting in them being devoured alive by the walkers. This event has had a lasting effect on Gabriel and he is extremely damaged and remorseful as a result of it. He believes himself to be a bad person, smitten by God, initially even believing that Rick Grimes ' group was sent to punish him. When he meets the Survivors, Gabriel begins to see the reality of the new world, but remains in disbelief of certain attributes such as cold blooded murder and even killing of the walkers as a necessary way to survive. He still retains his religious faith even as a result of witnessing true horrors, and is one of the few members of the Survivors who still holds his faith. Due to his cowardliness, lack of survival experience and religious nature, many members of the group initially do not seem particularly fond of Gabriel when they meet him, particularly Rick, Sasha Williams , and Maggie Greene . Gabriel, however, also seems to not care for the Survivors much following their massacre of Gareth and his people, as he betrays them to Deanna Monroe of the Alexandria Safe Zone and warns her that they are dangerous and bad people who have committed unspeakable atrocities. In this sense, Gabriel can also be classified as a hypocrite as he fails to see the irony that he is not a good person either and has also caused atrocities, although this could be seen as a self-serving act, him wishing to exile the only people in the world who know of his sins to secure his place in the community. Whilst Gabriel is talking to Deanna, both are unaware that Maggie is listening nearby, and she shows pure shock and anger in her face towards Gabriel's betrayal and hypocrisy. After Gabriel finally kills a walker and a suffering man, he turns cold and cruel for a brief period of time towards Sasha, who almost ends up killing him when he throws guilt on her shoulders and insults her deceased brother, Tyreese , but after Maggie defuses the situation, Gabriel eventually feels remorse for his actions and finally gains the forgiveness of Maggie and Sasha. In Season 6 it is revealed that Gabriel maintains his faith in God, and feels remorse for his betrayal of the Survivors, and is shown searching for forgiveness from Rick's son Carl . Gabriel is shown to have become more confident as he volunteers to help execute Rick's plan to deal with the walker herd , even though Rick shuts him down. He continues to demonstrate a growing inner strength, asking Carl for lessons on how to use weapons. After a gigantic herd of walkers invades Alexandria, Gabriel assists in protecting the group and, when the time comes to leave the house they are holed up in, he promises Rick that once they are outside, he will not run or turn back, which Rick acknowledges. In \" No Way Out \", he keeps his cool as he travels with Rick, Carl, Jessie Anderson , and her sons Ron and Sam amidst the walker herd. When Rick changes his plan, Gabriel volunteers to take Judith by himself to safety in his Church. He confidently assures Rick that he will keep her safe, and Rick thanks him. Later on Gabriel watches from his church as Rick and other Alexandria residents take to the streets in a last stand against the walkers. He gives Judith to a woman in his congregation, grabs his machete and without hesitation, heads out to join the battle. He explains that their prayers for the salvation of the town have been answered; God has given them the courage to save Alexandria themselves. Through his selfless actions, Gabriel has earned the respect of Rick and redeemed himself from his past, as demonstrated when he battles with the survivors against the horde. Gabriel has now shown to be brave and fearless as shown when he accompanies Rick and the group to attack a base under the control of the Saviors and personally executes one himself, showing that he is no longer afraid to take matters into his own hands. Gabriel has also shown to be becoming a leader as when Rick and the group leave to take Maggie to the Hilltop, Rick places Gabriel in charge of it's defense and Gabriel promises to not only protect Judith at all costs but Alexandria too, showing that he has now become a determined survivor who will do what it takes to protect those he cares about from danger. In Season 7, following the death of Glenn Rhee , Gabriel becomes the new moral compass of the group and, using his religious faith and newfound optimism, gives helpful advice to his friends, such as Rick, Spencer Monroe , and Rosita Espinosa , while they are under the rule of Negan and the Saviors . During a visit by Negan, Gabriel remains optimistic of an eventual positive outcome, and says as much to Rick, who tells him that there is no way out. Gabriel, however, remains hopeful. He later counsels Rosita when she becomes obsessed with killing Negan by herself, telling her to have patience so that the group can figure out how to put things right together, and at an opportune time. Though she ultimately ignores his advice and ends up blaming him for her failure and the consequences of her actions, Gabriel calmly and pleasantly tells her that he has no regrets over what he said, and reiterates his plea. While Rick and the others are out, Gabriel is ambushed within Alexandria by a member of a mysterious group called the Scavengers , and is taken hostage. When his friends discover him and are assaulted, he holds one of his captors at knife point and successfully manages to convince them to listen to Rick's proposition of an alliance to fight the Saviors, demonstrating his new-found resolve and determination. After the deal is made, he thanks Rick for believing in him and coming to his aid, and Rick tells Gabriel that he was what convinced him that enemies can become friends. Later, the Saviors and the Scavengers invaded Alexandria, and Gabriel was present alongside Alexandria's inhabitants fighting against them. As the battle draws to a close, he fires his machine gun against Negan's truck, although Negan manages to escape, much to his frustration. Gabriel later assists Rick and the Militia's plan in the assault against the Sanctuary and Negan by drawing a massive herd to the base and trap those within while taking out various outposts. With walkers quickly closing in on the Sanctuary, Gabriel restrains a hellbent Rick from killing Negan and further reminds Rick that their fight isn't purely about him. As Gabriel is about to leave with Rick, he notices a petrified Gregory and reluctantly comes to his aid only for Gregory to abandon Gabriel by stealing his car, showing Gabriel still believes in forgiveness of others like Gregory despite the latter's morally ambiguous and selfish character. In the years following the defeat of the Saviors and the apparent death of Rick Grimes, Gabriel grows into a leader in his own right, becoming the leader of the Alexandria Council and, by extension, the de facto leader of Alexandria, only held back by Michonne refusing to accept the council's votes regardless of the decision. He has also become more ruthless, willing to kill other survivors if need be and even killing Mays after he had relented due to the potential threat that Mays continued to pose, much to the shock of Aaron. By the time of the Reaper Conflict , Gabriel is suffering from a major crisis of faith, telling the dying Nicholls that \"God isn't here anymore.\" However, Gabriel refuses to kill Mancea when he sees the other priest praying and is shocked and intrigued by Mancea's claims that God speaks to him. Nevertheless, Gabriel still kills Mancea when the man stands in his way, but he tells Daryl shortly thereafter that he's trying to regain his faith now. Six months later, Gabriel has fully embraced his faith in God once again and enjoys working as a priest at the First Christian Church of the Commonwealth to the point that he has moved to the Commonwealth permanently and resigned from all of his other duties to enjoy just being a priest again. Witnessing one of Gabriel's sermons, Aaron notes how the message is one of hope rather than fire and brimstone as he was expecting, and Gabriel confirms that it wasn't an act either. Gabriel explains to Aaron that \"in the beginning, I was just going through the motions. But then one day I just wasn't. It was like a switch was flipped, and I could hear him again.\" As a result, leading his new flock in the Commonwealth helped him to renew his faith. Gabriel is shown to be well-loved by his new congregation, recognizing Nelson as a man who had seemed to be considering coming to Gabriel about his troubles and using that to convince the dying Nelson to help them. Before Gabriel leaves the Commonwealth, he gives a last sermon to an empty church which doesn't appear to deter his enthusiasm for it at all. During the Battle for the Commonwealth , Gabriel fully redeems himself for his previous cowardly and selfish actions. In a situation mirroring Gabriel locking his congregation out of his church out of fear, resulting in their deaths, a number of Commonwealth residents are locked out of the Estates with a massive herd bearing down on them. Rather than allow them to die as he did with his fellow congregants in the past, Gabriel makes a stand to save them, threatening to kill anyone who tries to stop him and bravely risking his own life in the process. With Daryl backing him up, Colonel Vickers relents, turning against Pamela Milton and ordering her men to give him the key to the gates.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Gabriel grew up in rural Georgia, although little is known about his early life. At a young age, he developed a deep faith in religion and thus desired to bring people together in order to help them navigate through their lives and improve upon their weaknesses. [3] Growing up, he would often run around the woods, and became accustomed to the sounds within it. As an adult, he became a priest positioned at St. Sarah's Episcopal Church , where throughout his holy service, he conducted weekly mass and also helped to promote several fundraisers where he befriended an organist , someone he became close with and may have developed romantic feelings towards. Several members of his congregation often commented that Gabriel's humor left much to be desired. [4]",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At the start of the outbreak, Gabriel barricaded himself inside his church for protection. Two weeks later, the morning after Atlanta was napalmed by the U.S. Military during Operation Cobalt , several members of his congregation arrived looking for shelter. Gabriel refused to let them inside due to being scared of what could happen if the supplies ran out. His congregation and their families were then devoured by the zombies . After burying the remains, a guilt-ridden Gabriel managed to survive nearly 18 months with the help of the collected canned goods, but became haunted by his cowardly actions.",

        "Trivia[]": "The casting call for this character used the name Michael Todd .
