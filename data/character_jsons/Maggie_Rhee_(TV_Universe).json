        "Maggie Rhee": "Maggie Rhee",
        "Overview[]": "Maggie is an intelligent, caring, and brave woman. She is shown to be a loving daughter, sister, friend, wife, and mother. Before meeting Rick Grimes ' group, she had trouble adapting to the true nature of the apocalyptic world as her family initially believes that the walkers were simply sick people. Her mindset changes after an almost death experience with a walker. After this occurs, she becomes more invested with the core group, now understanding the need to fight for survival despite this initially putting a strain on her relationship with her father, Hershel . Devoted to her husband, Glenn Rhee , and the people around her, she constantly looks out for the best interests of the group and becomes a strong contributor to her group after the destruction of her father's farm . Maggie was shown to be religious to an extent, although by the fifth season she appears to be an atheist. It is possible by the season's end she has repossessed her faith. During the third season , Maggie, like everyone else, had become battle-hardened after surviving the entire winter on the road, although she still retains her kind side. She is shown to become slightly suspicious and untrustworthy towards different survivors, such as Axel and Oscar , although she, like the rest of the group, eventually accept them. After an invasion of walkers into the prison as a result of Andrew , Maggie is forced to perform a fatal, emergency C-section on Lori Grimes to deliver her baby , an act that visibly traumatizes her for a short time; however, she quickly moves-on and becomes dedicated to keeping Lori's baby alive. Maggie's strong bravery is shown after she and Glenn are captured by Daryl 's brother, Merle , and taken to Woodbury where she is interrogated, threatened, and humiliated by the Governor , but does not crack until the latter threatens Glenn's life. Maggie is clearly traumatized by this ordeal for a short period, but overcomes her grief and actively takes part in the war against the Governor and Woodbury. It is evident by the season's end that Maggie is very much capable of committing murder to protect the people she cares about from danger. By the fourth season , Maggie maintains a strong position in the prison's community and is shown to have become fiercely devoted to the well being of her husband, family, and friends. Following the Governor's return, the destruction of the prison, and the brutal death of her beloved father, Hershel, Maggie embarks on a devoted journey to find her husband, Glenn, at all costs and seems to become slightly distant from others and somewhat reckless, although she eventually overcomes this. Maggie has no doubt accepted the utter cruelty of the post-apocalyptic world during this season as a result of her father's death, as she instantly assumes following the prison attack that her only remaining relative, Beth , is more than likely dead and makes no attempt to look for her after finding her husband, Glenn. During the fifth season, Maggie's personality changes dramatically as following the escape from Terminus , she is shown to become more traumatized by the horrors she has encountered and has developed a noticeably colder personality, as expressed during interactions with Father Gabriel in which she reveals that she is no longer religious and insults him. After the death of her sister, Beth, Maggie is visibly broken and traumatized and even claims she does not know if she wants to continue fighting to stay alive. These feelings appear lost after entering the Alexandria Safe Zone where she becomes much more relaxed and active in the community as Deanna Monroe 's assistant. By the season's end, Maggie is shown to have lost some of her colder personality aspects when she saves Gabriel from being killed by Sasha (after he betrayed her group to Deanna) and possibly appears to be religious again. She strongly believes in making a life in the new world, rather than constantly trying to stay alive. After Glenn's death, Maggie, grief stricken and depressed, is determined to fight the Saviors and kill Negan for the brutal murders of her husband and Abraham. She maintains her humanity by sparing and not mistreating the Saviors who surrendered or were captured. However, as the war with the Saviors progresses, Maggie becomes colder, slowly exposing a more ruthless side. She is focused and determined to kill Negan at all costs. Although Maggie is relieved after the war is won and is content that the Saviors who surrendered were kept alive, she is enraged at Rick and Michonne for deciding to allow Negan to live. She, along with Jesus and Daryl, calmly vow to make the Hilltop strong again and wait for the right moment to exact their revenge, implying that Maggie may have sinister intentions towards Rick and Michonne. By the ninth season, and 18 months after the end of the war against the Saviors, Maggie is in full command of the Hilltop and is a strong, effective and caring leader willing to do whatever is necessary to benefit her people. She is also a happy, loving mother to her newborn child. Despite this however, Maggie is still traumatized by the death of her husband, Glenn, as she refuses to go to Alexandria due to the fact that her husband's murderer, Negan, is incarcerated there under Rick's orders and no doubt still wants revenge against him and still appears to hold a grudge against the Saviors as a whole. She is shown to not be willing to take chances with those who pose a threat to her as she has Gregory hanged as punishment for his attempted assassination of her, claiming that the punishment must fit the crime, though she still gives Earl (the man who was manipulated by Gregory into killing her) a second chance after incarcerating him. Maggie's ideology of punishing threats directly conflicts with Rick's desire for the communities, including the Saviors, to all work together to build a civilization and avoid killing the living and this comes to fruition when she (and Daryl) allows Cyndie to murder Arat for revenge for killing her younger brother back when the Saviors were under Negan and Simon's leadership as this parallels with Glenn's death at the hands of Negan. Having had enough of Rick's views, Maggie becomes fully committed into killing Negan. However, upon meeting Negan at his jail cell, and seeing how broken and miserable Negan has become since his fall from power, Maggie finally realizes Rick's motives for letting Negan live: Being forced to live with his actions, and spend the rest of his life as a shell of his former self, begging for death, only to be denied. Maggie's change of view intensifies after Rick's supposed \"death\" not long afterwards, as she, alongside Daryl, blames herself for Rick's demise due to her commitment to kill Negan, and as a result, ultimately steps down as leader of the Hilltop. After Hershel is kidnapped by the Croat and his men, Maggie is hellbent on getting him back no matter the cost. However, she once again is forced to work together with Negan , much to her chagrin. Despite the two coming to an understanding of each other in the past , Maggie seemingly has gone back to hating Negan for what he did, something he calls her out on. It is later revealed that the Croat made a deal with Maggie: give him Negan in exchange for Hershel, showing that Maggie's hatred of Negan is rooted in guilt. Although she sees that the two of them make a good team and Negan is trying to make up for what he did, Maggie forces herself to hate Negan to convince her that giving him to the Croat is deserved. This causes Maggie to often be very manipulative and deceptive, lying to Negan and also Ginny about why she brought him there. Negan eventually sees through her lies causing the two getting into a fight, putting them at odds once again. Maggie does succeed in getting Hershel back, but at the cost of giving up Negan. Hershel calls out Maggie's obsession of Negan, which she at first denies. Maggie later realizes that Hershel is right and she promises to find a way to bring a final end to her obsession with Negan so that she can get peace.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Maggie Greene was born in 1988 in Georgia to her parents, Hershel and Josephine Greene . Hershel was a veterinarian and farmer. Maggie was raised on the Greene Family Farm and had a Christian upbringing. Hershel had previously been an alcoholic, but quit on the day Maggie was born and never allowed alcohol in the house when she was growing up. Maggie also formed a good relationship with the foreman Otis , and his wife and Hershel's veterinary assistant, Patricia . On one occasion, Hershel and Josephine took Maggie to visit the Amicalola Falls, the tallest waterfalls in Georgia. Early in Maggie's life, her mother died from an illness. By 1994, Hershel remarried a woman named Annette and gave birth to Maggie's half-sister, Beth . The marriage also brought in Annette's son and Maggie's step brother, Shawn . Hershel's marriage to Annette caused distraught Maggie to smoke and shoplift in her teen years. After her father told her they should \"love each other\", Maggie grew to have a loving relationship with her step-family. Though her days of smoking and shoplifting were over, she used a tractor to crush her ex-boyfriend's Chevrolet Camaro when she was in high school. By the time Maggie became an adult, she began to attend college. While there, she also took birth control and became sexually active.On her first summer back home from college, Maggie left her bags in her room and went horseback riding, but when she returned she discovered that her younger sister Beth had been rummaging through her bags and found her birth control pills. Maggie was furious when Beth threw them into the pond out in horror. Although they began to argue, they eventually ended up reconciling because they were soaked in mud because of Maggie's horse, and Beth covered for Maggie when Hershel asked what had happened. While Maggie was twenty-two before the Trials , it is unknown if she graduated college or had dropped out.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Maggie was with her family on their farm when the outbreak went global. Her family would watch the news on television and were mostly spared of the scourge of the apocalypse. Hershel was convinced that what he saw on the news were not dead people, but rather sick and dangerous people who needed to be cared for until a cure could arrive. During the beginning of the outbreak, Annette and Shawn were bitten by their undead fellow townspeople, and soon died and turned. However, Hershel had Otis put them in the barn until what seemed like an epidemic to him would be over eventually and a cure would be found, giving his daughters hope. Maggie, Beth, and Hershel then took in Otis, Patricia, and Beth's high school boyfriend, Jimmy and then barricaded themselves within the farm for the next months. She would also make runs into town to retrieve needed supplies. Over time, Hershel had Otis look for more \"infected\" and brought back people who the Greene family knew, including their cousin Arnold , their neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Fischer , and friends Lacey , and Duncan . The whole family were responsible for helping them in the barn and routinely feeding the infected with live chickens. After over two months since the outbreak, Otis then brought an unknown infected girl in the barn and went back out to hunt for deer.",
