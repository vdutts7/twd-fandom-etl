        "Beth Greene": "Beth Greene",
        "Overview[]": "Beth is a shy, soft-spoken, and caring sixteen-year old girl who lived a normal life with her family. She lived on her father's farm and attended the local high school. She went to church regularly and strongly believes in her faith. As a result of her father's heavy drinking, she never drank alcohol. Her first appearance was in Season 2 and as the season developed, so did she. As the apocalypse started, Beth had been sheltered from the chaos surrounding her. At first, Beth is rather timid, pessimistic, and keeps her emotions to herself, but after being forced to see her mother's death and horrific reanimation, Beth finally breaks down and a different part of her is shown. She tells her sister, Maggie , that she wants to commit suicide. However, after an attempt at slitting her wrist, she has a change of heart and decides to live. With the support from her father and sister, Beth regains her will to live and since then, becomes even more assertive and stronger-willed, even after the death of her boyfriend and Patricia . By the time the group arrives at the West Georgia Correctional Facility , where they will remain for nearly seven months, Beth has grown more self-assured and goes on to become a more important and vocal member of the group. Beth is a source of optimism and hope for the group, often singing to help boost morale. She is much more hopeful and optimistic and sees the positive side rather than the negative side in a hopeless situation. After the death of Lori Grimes , Beth helps the rest of the group with taking care of Lori's newborn baby Judith . After the Woodbury conflict, Beth is emotionally stronger, trying many different ways to deal with the loss of hope that grows everyday, realizing that things may someday take a turn for the worse. After dating Zach , she becomes emotionally distant, preparing herself so that when someone she loves dies, she won't shut down emotionally like she would have in the past. After Zach's death, she spends her time dealing with the new crisis surrounding the prison. Beth keeps hope alive, while struggling with herself not to break down emotionally. After her father's death, Beth is distraught but grows stronger and finds new strength in herself. Beth becomes more independent and more skillful at killing walkers. After she escapes from the prison assault with Daryl Dixon , the two become very close, and Beth's faith becomes stronger. She believes there is still hope and good people somewhere, even in this cruel world. She also thinks that since walkers used to be human, they shouldn't be treated cruelly or be made fun of, but instead, respectfully put out of their misery to preserve their humanity. When she is taken to Grady Memorial Hospital , she becomes even more independent, being forced to help care for patients at the hospital whilst planning an escape with Noah .",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Beth Greene was born to Hershel and Annette Greene in 1994 on the Greene Family Farm in rural Georgia. Beth was born the youngest to two half-siblings, her older brother Shawn , who belonged to her mother, and Maggie , the eldest, who belonged to Hershel and his late-wife, Josephine . As Beth grew older, Maggie initially resented her and her side of the family, but through her father and beliefs came to love Beth, Annette, and Shawn. Beth also became close with family friend and farmhand, Otis , and his wife, Patricia . Hershel still had his habit of drinking alcohol, but strictly forbade her ever to drink. Hershel also raised her to do good things in life, and to believe in God and faith. Hershel always protected Beth from the harsh reality from the outside world and not to follow the bad things he had done in his past life, such as going to jail and drinking alcohol. Her family raised her to have good manners and behavior, and were usually overprotective of her. Unlike Maggie, Beth was oblivious to the outside world. She perceived things in a different perspective, and as a result she believed that there's goodness and hope in everything, even in the most desperate situations. As evident, when Beth was twelve and Maggie had returned for her first summer from college, she found birth control pills in Maggie's bag. In horror, she threw them in the lake and was caught by Maggie who was horseback riding. The two began to argue, later involved by Shawn, and the commotion caused Maggie's horse to cover all of them in mud, making them laugh and resolve their issues. When Hershel asked what had happened, Beth lied for Maggie. As a young child, she had a passion for singing and playing the piano and guitar. She attended high school, along with Jimmy , and began a casual relationship with him roughly three months before the outbreak. Jimmy was often protective of Beth.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "As the outbreak went global, Beth's mother and Shawn were bitten by walkers. The two later died from the infection. Hershel had Otis take them to the barn where they reanimated. Due to what they saw on the news, Hershel believed the walkers were still alive and are simply sick people and that while dangerous, needed to be cared for as he believed the pandemic would end and a cure would save them. Their ignorance was a mixture of grief and being mostly spared by the apocalypse on their isolated farm. Hershel barricaded his remaining family, Jimmy, Otis, and Patricia within the farm. Beth was devastated by her mother and brother's deaths, and her typically positive outlook on the world slowly started changing to a more grim and hopeless one. Over time, Otis began to bring more walkers to the barn, in which Beth and the others were in charge of helping put them in and feeding them with live chickens. Among those in the barn were their cousin, Arnold Greene , their neighbors the Fischers , and friends Lacey and Duncan .",
        "Death[]": "Killed By Herself (Indirectly Caused) Dawn Lerner (Accidental) Shortly after the trade between the Survivors and the Grady Memorial survivors, Dawn demands Noah to be returned to her. After Noah agrees to return, Beth runs up to him and hugs him, before turning to Dawn. Beth tells Dawn that she \"gets it now\", as she slips the scissors out from beneath her cast and stabs her vest in a futile attempt to prove her point. Dawn reflexively pulls out her gun and shoots Beth in the head, but realizes she didn't mean to.",
        "Killed Victims[]": "This list shows the victims Beth has killed: Christopher's Father (Zombified) Gavin Trevitt (Accidental) Gorman (Caused) Jeffries (Indirectly Caused) O'Donnell Dawn Lerner (Caused) Herself (Indirectly Caused) Many unnamed prisoners (Zombified) Numerous counts of zombies",

I don’t think the actor knows that. You know, I love Emily Kinney . But I felt that would have had too big an impact on the group. It would have just devastated poor Hershel . It would have taken him down a path I didn’t want for the rest of the season.
