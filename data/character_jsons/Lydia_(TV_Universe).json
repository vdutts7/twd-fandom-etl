        "Lydia": "Lydia",
        "Overview[]": "Lydia is a cunning and hardened, yet deeply traumatized young woman, suffering from years of physical and psychological abuse inflicted on her by her mother, Alpha. While initially being fully devoted to the Whisperer way, and only acting as a scared little girl, her time at the Hilltop reawakened memories of her childhood. While she initially believed her father was abusive and her mother caring, these memories were the product of years of gaslighting from Alpha. The truth was quite the opposite, as Lydia finally realized during her brief captivity. Lydia also believed her mother's physical abuse was done out of love and was necessary to strengthen her. Her time with Henry made her resent the Whisperer lifestyle, and she expressed a desire to stay at the Hilltop. Nonetheless, Lydia selflessly chose to go back to her mother and the Whisperers in order to save Alden and Luke, that were being kept hostage by Alpha. When Henry came after her and was captured, Lydia punched him in anger, though this was most likely an act. Later, she is unable to kill Henry when her mother commands her to, and chooses to run away with Henry when Daryl and Connie come to rescue him. When Alpha kills Henry and 9 other fair attendees, Lydia becomes depressed and even suicidal, and is shown to feel tremendous guilt over the event, particularly as she was in love with Henry as she revealed in \" Silence the Whisperers \". Once Carol refuses to kill her and encourages her to live, Lydia regains some of her old self back, and even participates in a snowball fight at Alexandria. Once away from her mother, Lydia displayed a greatly caring and gentle personality, though she was unwilling to suffer abuse or be used as a pawn by those around her. While initially appearing to be something of a coward, surrendering without a fight in her first encounter to Daryl and the others, she has displayed a great deal of courage and determination over time, bravely risking her own life to defend the Hilltop even though she knew her mother wanted her back. However, this can work against her in some situations such as when she fought back against her bullies with kindness and only succeeded in enraging them more in the attempt. Unlike some survivors of the zombie apocalypse, Lydia does not like violence and killing, a trait she shared with Henry. To this extent, Henry promised before going into a fight that he wouldn't kill anyone, but Lydia forgave him when he was forced to in self-defense, recognizing the necessity of it despite her hatred for all of the killing. Notably, when Lydia did begin training in combat, she chose to utilize Henry's staff as a weapon rather than the more lethal spears, knives or bows of the Coalition. Along with potentially being an act of sentimentality since the staff belonged to her boyfriend before his murder, utilizing the staff gave Lydia the ability to non-lethally take out a human opponent and avoid killing if faced with such a situation while still being a lethally effective weapon against walkers and humans if need be. After falling in love with Elijah , Lydia becomes afraid of acting upon her feelings due to her fears of losing someone that she loves again, even pulling away from Elijah to keep herself from getting hurt. After Aaron gives her advice based upon his own relationship , Lydia opens herself up to love again, although she reassures Carol that she will never stop loving Henry. Upon being separated from Elijah by a herd, Lydia is desperate to get to him, even after losing her arm, and despairs that she may have lost someone else she loves when Elijah doesn't show up at the Commonwealth. A year after Pamela Milton 's defeat, Lydia is still happily with Elijah, has adjusted well to her missing arm and enjoys the peaceful life that she's finally gotten the chance to experience.",

        "Trivia[]": "The casting call for this character used the name Molly . [2] Lydia was affectionately named as \"bug\" by her parents. Lydia suffers from gaslighting as a result of her mother's manipulation over the memories of her father. She also suffered from suicidal thoughts after the loss of Henry, though she had made great strides in recovery in Season 11. Lydia bears several scars across her right arm which had been sustained from a birch tree whipping inflicted by Alpha. Lydia is the first named Whisperer to appear in the show. Unlike her comic book counterpart, Lydia is brunette instead of blonde. Due to the lack of formal education during her time with the Whisperers, Lydia is illiterate, and is forced to learn to read with children who are much younger than herself. Lydia wields Henry 's staff in Season 10 following his death in \" The Calm Before \". She is shown to have added a nunchuck to it, something that neither Henry nor Morgan Jones ever used. She is one of eleven known characters to have seen Beta 's face. The other ten characters being Alpha , Mary , Daryl , Negan , Beta's best friend , a Whisperer , Daniel , Grace , Dennis , and Silas with the latter four being unknowingly. In \" Walk With Us \", an injured Lydia uses her staff as a walking stick like Henry did following the events of \" Chokepoint \" and Morgan Jones in the first half of Season 4 of Fear the Walking Dead and later in \" ... I Lose Myself \". Lydia is the tenth main character in the TV Series to have an amputation. The first being Merle Dixon , the second being Hershel Greene , the third being The Governor , the fourth being Bob Stookey , the fifth being Gareth , the sixth being Tyreese Williams , the seventh being Jessie Anderson , the eighth being Carl Grimes , and the ninth being Aaron . Lydia is one of the five characters in The Walking Dead universe who survive a zombie bite due to amputation and confirmed to be alive, others being Lilly Caul , Clementine , Elton Ortiz , and Alicia Clark . Lydia is one of twelve characters to survive the TV Series who also survive in the Comic Series , the others being Maggie Rhee , Michonne Grimes , Eugene Porter , Aaron , Hershel Rhee , Negan Smith , Magna , Yumiko Okumura , Juanita Sanchez , Michael Mercer , and Pamela Milton . Lydia is one of the two TV Universe characters to appear in Tales of the Walking Dead , the others being Alpha . Out of these, Lydia is the only one portrayed by different actors: Cassady McClincy ( TV Series ) and Scarlett Blum ( Tales ) . Scarlett Blum also portrayed a younger version of Lydia in the episode \" Dee \" of Tales of the Walking Dead . Lydia is the sixth and final main character to receive an amputation, with the first being Hershel Greene , the second being Merle Dixon , the third being Bob Stookey , the fourth being Tyreese Williams , and the fifth being Aaron . Despite Maggie mentioning that everyone who lived in Hilltop moved to the Bricks , it is unknown if Lydia, Elijah , and Adam are among the residents, as they did not appear nor were they mentioned in The Walking Dead: Dead City . However, given Lydia and Elijah's jobs as couriers, they may simply be elsewhere at the moment given the distance between the communities or they relocated to one of the other communities. Given Lydia's friendship with Negan , it's likely that Maggie would've mentioned it if something had happened to her.",
