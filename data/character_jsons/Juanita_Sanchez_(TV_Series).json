        "Juanita Sanchez": "",
        "Overview[]": "As she hasn't had much interaction with other people for some time, Juanita comes off as quite foolish, yet intriguing to the members of the expedition. She admits that she's been on her own for over a year, and 'it totally sucks', even questioning at first if the trio were actually real or just hallucinations. Regardless, Juanita is open to try and build trust with the survivors. Juanita comes off as extremely talkative and easy-going. She is willing to make jokes at any given moment, despite the severity of the situation. Juanita also appears to be very childish, as she dyed her hair purple and chose to wear a pink fur jacket and goggles, just for fun. She also gave herself the nickname \"Princess\" and states that being called a \"Queen\" would make her sound old and pretentious. Regardless of her happy-go-lucky nature, she can be taken seriously in combat and is able to mow down walkers easily. She is also shown to be surprisingly observant, noticing little details about the Commonwealth soldiers guarding her, Yumiko, Eugene and Ezekiel that her companions didn't notice.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Juanita Sanchez was born in 1992 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In her early childhood she was diagnosed with ADHD. Her father left the family in 2001, when Juanita was nine years old, for unknown reasons, which caused her to speculate he may have left due to having caught her smoking his cigarettes one day. About six months later, her mother met and married a man named Dougie and prioritized him over her own daughter, resulting in the two of them abusing and neglecting Juanita. Dougie brought his son into the marriage, who eventually joined in on the abuse. At school and home, Juanita was a lonely and socially awkward individual, who never had any real friends, and was once told that she was \"hard to love\" by someone, possibly a family member. However, at some point, a neighbor or teacher named Mrs. Travis was kind and accepting of her. In high school, Juanita met a \"cool girl\" who taught her how to dye her hair and it helped Juanita's self-esteem and image. When Juanita was 14, she was locked in the closet by her stepfather. While trying to chip the wood away, she got a splinter. The splinter caused a serious infection and kept her home from school. Her mom then sent her back to school before the hand could heal and her hand got infected again. Her mother didn't notice or seem to care, while her stepfather was disgusted by it, kept her from eating at the dinner table and laughed at her. When Juanita retaliated, her stepfather smacked her against her jaw. Juanita asked her mom for help and pleaded with her to not make her eat out in the garage. Juanita's mother then told her to not eat. When she was 15, Juanita got her first job as a waitress at Missy Moose's Pizzeria. After receiving her first paycheck, she went to the bank and asked for a $2 dollar bill. Since then, Juanita kept the bill in her pocket to remind her of earning her own money for the first time and being independent from her neglectful family. During high school, she was also employed at a music record store. At some point, Juanita was arrested for an unknown reason and claims that she didn't do it, that someone else had done the crime.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point in the apocalypse, Juanita settled into an abandoned city in the mid-Atlantic area, mostly cleared of the undead where she found entertainment in posing walkers in strange positions that resembled everyday life with exaggerated clothing. She recalls that the last time she encountered another survivor was over a year prior to meeting Eugene, Ezekiel, and Yumiko.",
        "Killed Victims[]": "This list shows the victims Juanita has killed: 2 unnamed horses (Indirectly Caused) Numerous counts of zombies and possibly unnamed people",
