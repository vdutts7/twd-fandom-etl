        "Overview[]": "At first, Elijah seems to be a mysterious, quiet, and aloof person. Due to wearing a mask, he is initially hard to read. However, after taking it off for the first time, he is revealed to not be as stoic as he may seem, and is visibly scared of the Reapers . He is shown to be a reliable friend of Maggie , to whom he is extremely loyal. During their attack on Meridian , Elijah becomes extremely vengeful against the Reapers, specifically Brandon Carver , who murdered his sister . When the Reapers are allowed to walk away, he is visibly enraged. He reminds Maggie of her promise to take revenge, which is the main factor in Maggie's decision to kill the remaining Reapers.

After the arrival of the Commonwealth , he chooses to remain in Hilltop , where he forms a crush on Lydia , which later develops into a relationship.",

        "Trivia[]": "In \" A Certain Doom \", Elijah was portrayed by stuntman Joshua Lamboy . The weapons that Elijah is seen carrying are two Japanese sickles called kama . According to Angela Kang in Talking Dead for \" No Other Way \", the role of Elijah was originally much smaller but after Okea Eme-Akwari's audition tape of him performing silent grief, they decided to expand his role and give him more story. Originally, Elijah was intended to have first encountered Maggie Rhee shortly after departing on her first expedition with Georgie , however, this was later scrapped, likely due to the expansion of Elijah's character upon the casting of Okea Eme-Akwari. [2] Elijah appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of \" Lockdown \" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins. Alex Meraz confirmed that Elijah was originally going to be the one to kill Carver , before they later changed it to Maggie. [3] Elijah is the only named resident of Meridian, Warden or otherwise, confirmed to be alive.",
