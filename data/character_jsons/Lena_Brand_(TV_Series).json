        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point during the outbreak, Lena joined a community in Ohio. Lena Brand is among a group of upper class citizens in Pamela Milton 's office expressing their concerns over recent incidents and thanking Pamela for her reassurances and actions taken against the Virginia immigrants. Lena then takes the opportunity to express her condolences for the loss of Sebastian and comments how devastated Kayla is. She is shocked when Yumiko barges into the office and punches one of Pamela's bodyguards. She and the other citizens then leave Pamela's office at her request, to which Lena gives Yumiko a look before walking past her. That evening, Lena is seated in the front row of the press conference in Union Station. She listens as the press secretary and Yumiko address the crowd, applauding when Tomichi is publicly praised by Yumiko. She is shocked when Yumiko announces her intent to defend Eugene and go against Governor Milton and gives Yumiko a displeased look. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Lena's fate is left unknown. It is possible she was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",
