        "Overview[]": "Hershel is the quintessential stubborn farmer. Perhaps stemming from his religious beliefs, he believes strongly in what he considers to be right and is known to be uncompromising in defense of his morals. He also cares deeply for his family and protecting them (particularly his daughters Maggie and Beth). Protecting is one of the few times he will go against even his own moral code and do what needed to be done. Hershel is a former alcoholic who spent a lot of time at the Carriage Bar before the birth of his daughter Maggie . After giving up drinking on the day of Maggie's birth, Hershel went so far as to ban all alcohol from his house to avoid temptation. Hershel relapsed following the barn massacre, but once again gave up drinking immediately afterwards, telling Dave and Tony this during the confrontation in the bar. When Rick first encounters Hershel, Hershel holds a belief that the walkers are still living people who are sick and as such, he keeps the ones he can find in the barn on his farm until a cure can be found for them. At one point, Hershel compares a walker's crazed state to a schizophrenic. Hershel refuses to hear otherwise and sees the dangerous people as those who go around killing the walkers, believing it to be murder. Hershel's beliefs come mainly from the fact that he was living a sheltered life on his farm and most of what he knew about walkers came from watching the chaos of the Apocalypse on TV. After seeing Shane Walsh shoot Louise Bush multiple times in the chest and Louise keep coming, Hershel realized his mistake. As a result, he finally accepted that his wife was gone, but became so despondent that he took up drinking once again briefly. As of Seasons 3 and 4, Hershel is shown to be a skilled diplomat, often talking down the other survivors from taking disastrous actions or talking them into taking the right ones, though these talks do not work as desired with everyone .",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Hershel grew up on a farm that had been possessed by his family for over 160 years. As a young child, he was gifted a pocket watch originally owned by his father that had been passed down to him through generations. Hershel experienced a difficult childhood and thus had a negative relationship with his alcoholic and abusive father where eventually by the age of fifteen he moved out. Hershel never let go of the grudge he held against his father and thus avoided all contact with him which resulted in him not being present at his deathbed. In his later years, Hershel became a veterinarian due to his love for animals and decided to return to his family farm. He later met Josephine Greene where the two then became married. Within the first few years of their marriage however, Hershel began to descend into alcoholism much like his father. He would return drunk from the local barn and was forced to sleep on the downstairs couch by Josephine. Additionally, he pawned his pocket watch in order to pay off his drinking debt, though Josephine was able to repurchase his watch which she held onto until he had proven to be able to sober up. Sometime later, the pair had their first daughter Maggie Greene , whose birth enabled Hershel to finally give up his alcoholism habit. Six years later Josephine died due to unknown circumstances. Hershel eventually met another woman, Annette , who had a son Shawn from a previous marriage, and they fell in love. They later became married and had their child Beth Greene . Initially, Hershel was faced with hostility from Maggie for his remarriage though she eventually warmed to her new step-mother. When Hershel inherited the farm, a larger farming company offered to buy the farm from him, offering more than three times the actual price of the farm's worth. Hershel refused to sell the farm, despite there being a drought which ruined their crops. Whenever the farming company left Hershel supplies so he can feed his cattle, Hershel would leave the supplies to rot as a form of protest. Eventually, the farming company gave up on trying to buy the farm. At some point later Hershel employed Otis as his personal ranch foreman alongside his wife Patricia who became close friends towards the farming family.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At the onset of the outbreak, Annette and Shawn were bitten by their undead fellow townspeople, and soon died and turned. Hershel, not believing their deaths and thinking they were merely under a disease of some kind (as the television/radio broadcasts seemed to imply) had Otis put them in the barn until what seemed like an epidemic to him would blow over and a cure would be found. He barricaded his remaining family and friends within the farm and had Otis continue to wrangle the undead townspeople that came onto the premises and put them in the barn during the next months.",
        "Death[]": "Killed By Philip Blake (Alive) After Rick pleads with the Governor's group to put down their guns and join them at the prison, the Governor blatantly refuses under his breath and proceeds to slice Hershel's neck using Michonne's katana. Then, as a mortally wounded Hershel vainly drags himself away from the fight, slowly dying from lost blood, the Governor catches up with him and brutally hacks the rest of his neck, completely decapitating him in the process. Michonne Hawthorne (Zombified) After the destruction of the prison, Michonne finds Hershel's reanimated head and, with sadness, puts it down.",
        "Killed Victims[]": "This list shows the victims Hershel has killed: Sean (Caused) Caleb Subramanian (Zombified) Noris' Son (Zombified) Owen's Mother (Zombified) Many unnamed West Georgia Correctional Facility prisoners (Zombified) 2 unnamed prison newcomers (1 Before Reanimation, 1 Zombified) Numerous counts of zombies",

        "Trivia[]": "Hershel was one of the few members of the Rick's group who believed in God and the afterlife. In many ways, Hershel had replaced Dale as the moral compass of the group. This was foreshadowed both by their interaction with each other and with other survivors: Dale's conversation with Hershel in \" Judge, Jury, Executioner \" consisted of him appealing to Hershel for support regarding the fate of a prisoner. Hershel turned a blind eye at the time, which is ironic, as Hershel would later plead a case for Rick to spare Tyreese and his group's lives in \" The Suicide King \". Dale had a very paternal relationship with Glenn , who actively sought his approval. Hershel would later become a very real father after Glenn became involved with his daughter Maggie . Rick revealed in his eulogy at Dale's funeral that he would often look to him for approval regarding difficult moral dilemmas. He would later tell Hershel of his plan to turn Michonne over to The Governor in hopes of a truce and, when asked by Hershel why he was telling him and not the others, Rick answered that he was hoping Hershel could talk him out of it. Dale in the comic series lost his leg and had to use crutches and later a peg-leg Andrea built for him. With Dale dying much earlier in the TV series, Hershel lost his leg, survived, and was forced to use crutches. By season 4 , he obtained a prosthetic leg which is more advanced than Dale's Comic Series peg-leg and which permitted him to wear a full pair of boots again. On the Talking Dead episode in which Scott Wilson guest stars discussing \" Too Far Gone \", in which Hershel is killed, a strong parallel is made between the characters of Dale and Hershel, who are confirmed to have been moral centers for the group, and that this had a strong impact on fan reactions to their deaths. Scott Wilson, who portrays Hershel, revealed that there is a portrait of his mother as a young girl hanging in the farm house . [1] Hershel was initially scripted to be killed by Randall in the episode \" Better Angels \" during Randall's escape. However, the producers decided to allow the character to live so that they could explore the dramatic potential of losing his farm in \" Beside the Dying Fire \" and Season 3 . [2] Hershel is the first person in the TV Series to survive the infection, due to having his leg amputated so the infection can be contained from the blood. Hershel is the first Greene family member to be killed on a mid-season finale; he was followed by his youngest daughter, Beth, who was killed in the mid-season finale of Season 5 . Both also died after Rick tried to talk the killer into letting them go. Hershel is one of few characters to have appeared in almost every form of Walking Dead media, having appeared in the comic series, TV series, Social Game, video game, and novels. A painted portrait of Hershel could be seen in the Barrington House as a part of a shrine in the episode \" Morning Star \", alongside other paintings of Maggie's family, including Glenn Rhee and Beth Greene. Hershel is the third main character to become a walker, the first being Shane Walsh , the second being Merle Dixon , the fourth being Deanna Monroe , the fifth being Spencer Monroe , the sixth being Sasha Williams , the seventh being Simon , the eighth being Enid , the ninth being Tara Chambler , the tenth being Siddiq , the eleventh being Alpha , the twelfth being Alden , and the thirteenth being Lance Hornsby . Hershel is the first main character to be bitten by a walker, the second being Andrea Harrison , the third being Bob Stookey , the fourth being Tyreese Williams , the fifth being Deanna Monroe , the sixth being Carl Grimes , and the seventh being Rosita Espinosa . Hershel is the only one of the six to survive the bite, as Rick amputates his leg. Tyreese was also amputated after the bite, but later died of blood loss. Hershel is the fourth main character to be killed by another main character, the first being Dale Horvath , the second being Shane Walsh , the third being Merle Dixon , the fifth being Gareth , the sixth being Abraham Ford , the seventh being Glenn Rhee , the eighth being Spencer Monroe , the ninth being Simon , the tenth being Gregory , the eleventh being Enid , the twelfth being Tara Chambler , and the thirteenth being Alpha , the fourteenth being Leah Shaw , and the fifteenth being Lance Hornsby . Hershel is the first main character to die in a mid-season finale, the second being Philip Blake , the third being Beth Greene , the fourth being Deanna Monroe , the fifth being Spencer Monroe , and the sixth being Paul Rovia . Hershel is the last named character to be directly killed by Philip Blake in the TV Series . Hershel is the first main character to receive an amputation, with the second being Merle Dixon , the third being Bob Stookey , the fourth being Tyreese Williams , the fifth being Aaron , and the sixth being Lydia . He is also the first character to receive an amputation. Hershel appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of \" A New Deal \" and \" Outpost 22 \" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins. Hershel appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode \" Rest in Peace \".",
