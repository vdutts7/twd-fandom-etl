        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "After the onset of the outbreak, Jorge and the other members of the Vatos gang found refuge in a nursing home in the city, and they decided to protect all the seniors who were left behind by the nursing staff. As Daryl Dixon covers Glenn Rhee , who is recovering the bag of guns , Miguel creeps up towards the exit in the alley. He sneaks up on Daryl, to which he pops out and aims his crossbow at him. Miguel screams for help, prompting Jorge and Felipe to arrive and beat Daryl up, which is when Glenn arrives with the guns. He notices Glenn with the bag and tells Felipe to get the bag that they were also after. During the scuffle, Daryl shoots an arrow at Felipe, with Glenn dropping the bag and Rick Grimes and T-Dog arriving. Jorge abducts Glenn and quickly escapes with Felipe but leaves behind Miguel. When Rick and the others approach their compound, Guillermo exits the building with Jorge, Felipe, and some other members of the Vatos gang. Jorge is one of the men armed and ready for a fight, but stands down at Guillermo's command. During the second encounter, he is armed and ready for another possible gunfight, but an old woman, Abuela , rushes out for Felipe, insisting that Mr. Gilbert needs help, ceasing the threat of a bloodshed. Jorge and his group of survivors are left with extra guns and ammo from Rick and they continue to survive and care for the elderly.",
