        "Overview[]": "Dale's age, calm experience, and RV provide the nucleus around which the small community of survivors formed. He is shown to be honest, reasonable and protective. He is sometimes profound, and is the elder of the group, though is also rather feisty, not afraid to speak his mind and call others out for mistakes in judgment. He attempts to serve as \"the moral compass\" of the group. Over time he, Andrea, and Amy form their own little family unit and he finds spending time with them has helped bring him back to life in a way he never anticipated, as it gives him somebody he can attempt to influence. Dale is a fairly self-sufficient man, and ever watchful of the changing dynamics among the survivor community.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Dale was born in 1946 and was married to a woman named Irma for years. Early in their marriage, they had attempted to have a baby, but it ultimately miscarriages, which led them to not try again. At some point later, she developed cancer. Despite Dale bringing her to several doctors, she had already accepted the disease and her eventual death, much to his dismay. Once he retired from his job, Dale planned to take his wife traveling with him across the country in a new RV he bought, but she died before that could happen. Her death brought him into a great depression, and he found himself not caring about anyone around him. He decided to take his RV and do the trip alone.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "During the onset of the outbreak, Dale encountered Andrea and Amy in Atlanta, and rescued them as the city was overrun. Sometime later, they encountered and joined a campsite of survivors outside the outskirts of the city. During their stay, Dale cared increasingly for the sisters, and used his RV as a type of command post for the group.",
        "Death[]": "Killed By Carl Grimes (Indirectly Caused) Zombie (Caused) Dale is patrolling around the farm at night when he stumbles across a partially devoured cow. After hearing something behind him, Dale turns around and is ambushed by a walker that had freed itself from the swamp, after Carl had provoked it earlier that day. Although he is able to prevent himself from being bitten, the walker rips open Dale's stomach. Daryl Dixon (Out of Mercy) After realizing Dale's injuries are too severe, Rick lifts his gun and points it at Dale's head in an attempt to put him out of his misery, but can not bring himself to do so. Instead, Daryl takes Rick's gun, points it at Dale and says, \"Sorry, brother,\" before shooting him.",
        "Killed Victims[]": "This list shows the victims Dale has killed: Numerous counts of zombies",

        "Trivia[]": "Prior to Dale's death, it was reported that a cast member wanted to leave the show and then had a change of heart after original showrunner Frank Darabont was fired. This cast member was later assumed to be Jeffrey DeMunn . It was later confirmed by Chandler Riggs and Darabont that DeMunn departed from The Walking Dead due to Darabont's firing, but neither made mention of DeMunn changing his mind. Dale is one of only 3 main characters from the original Atlanta group to have never killed a living person, the others being Andrea Harrison and Lori Grimes . Dale's death shows irony. He comforts Andrea due to the fact that she feels bad for accidentally shooting and almost killing Daryl Dixon . He says \"Besides, we've all wanted to shoot Daryl\". Later on, when Dale gets mutilated by a walker , Daryl was the one to mercifully kill him by shooting him. Dale was also Daryl's first human kill. Dale's most used weapon was a rifle called Remington 700 VLS which he used until his death. Significantly, the rifle was used later frequently by Rick Grimes , but the current location of the rifle or who currently possessed it is unknown. In the episode \" The Distance \" while the group is driving to Alexandria , their RV breaks down. Glenn Rhee then fixes the problem by replacing a dead battery; Abraham Ford asks how Glenn knows that, to which Glenn replies with a knowing smile. This, although not confirmed, could be a nod to the moments when Dale was teaching Glenn about how to fix the RV. The final five episodes of Season 5 (\" Remember \", \" Forget \", \" Spend \", \" Try \", \" Conquer \") are all references to Dale's campfire story from Season 1 : \"I like what the father said to the son when he gave him a watch that had been handed down through generations. He said: 'I give you a mausoleum of all hope and desire which will fit your individual needs, no better than it did mine and my father before me. I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you may forget it. For a moment, now and then, and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it.'\" Dale's death has a coincidental poetic quality to it. He dies right after protesting the killing of Randall Culver , insisting that they should give him a fair shot like any civilized society would do. After his death, the group begins to shed any semblance of old norms and societal conditioning, committing more and more morally questionable acts. For the Atlanta group, Dale's death truly was the death of reason and civilization, much like what Dale lamented would happen.
