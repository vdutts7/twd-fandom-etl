        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Nick is seen banging and clawing on the fence with other walkers as Mika Samuels , her sister Lizzie , and Luke are waving to him and the other walkers, calling his name happily as if playing with him. When Carl Grimes and Patrick walk up to them, Carl asks what it is they're doing. Lizzie responds by saying they saw his name tag and wanted to name the other walkers around him. Carl responds to their behavior by telling them bluntly that walkers aren't like living people and don't need or deserve to be given names, and even tells them that they never saw anyone come back as one of them, only for Lizzie to silently tell him she has. There is a picture drawn by a child with Nick labeled, presumably drawn by Lizzie. Later Nick is seen dead among other walkers at the fence and Lizzie is upset with his death, prompting Carol to inform Lizzie that he was just a walker, not a person.",
