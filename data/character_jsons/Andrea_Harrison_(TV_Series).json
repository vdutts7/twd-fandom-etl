        "Overview": "Andrea is strong, cautious, and brave. She was extremely protective of her younger sister before her death. Never one to shy away from a challenge or a fight. Andrea is stubborn, opinionated and first and foremost interested in keeping herself and those she cares about most out of harms way. Her closeness to Amy is what directly influences her into becoming suicidal around the end of season one and possibly her reason to punish Dale Horvath , as she blames him for not letting her die in the way she wanted to and continuing to make her live in the cruel post-apocalyptic world. During season two, she begins to become more independent, even considering leaving the group, and wanting to keep the gun her father gave her, despite Dale's disapproval due to her lack of gun knowledge and brief suicidal streak. However, after adequate training with Shane Walsh , she becomes quite efficient with firearms and became a strong protector for the group and is more than willing to protect the group from any danger. It is shown that Andrea looks up to Shane as a better leader for the group than Rick and follows him on many crucial decisions such as abandoning the search for Sophia and killing the walkers in Hershel's barn. Her new attitude causes her to neglect helping around the farm in favor of sitting on Dale's RV with a gun much of the time, earning her the ire of the others for not doing her share of the farm's chores. By season three, she had been separated from the group after the farm was overrun, and was saved by Michonne Hawthorne , with whom she forms a close bond. After being brought to Woodbury , she begins a relationship with the Governor , which eventually ends when Andrea realizes that the Governor has a dark, sadistic nature. During the second half of the third season, it is shown that Andrea possesses strong leadership abilities as shown by a speech delivered to the Woodbury people following an attack by Rick and his group and does not see a war between the two groups as necessary. Andrea was shown to have become very bold as shown by her attempt to kill the Governor in order to protect her former group from certain death by the man but unfortunately failed, leading to her tragic demise.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse": "Andrea was born in 1974, twelve years ahead of her sister. Because of their different personalities, their parents gave them different upbringings. During this time she was in college to study law, Andrea remained distant from her family, frequently missing Amy 's birthday parties. After getting a degree, she eventually became a successful civil rights attorney. Before Andrea and Amy went on a road trip, their father gave Andrea a gun for protection, which she has remained protective over ever since.",
        "Post-Apocalypse": "During the onset of the outbreak, Andrea and Amy were heading back to Amy's college after their trip when they were stranded in Atlanta . As the city was overrun, they were rescued by Dale Horvath. Sometime later, they encountered and joined a campsite of survivors outside the outskirts of the city.",
        "Death": "Killed By Philip Blake (Caused) The Governor stabs Milton in the stomach, intending to have the zombified Milton eat a bound Andrea alive. Milton Mamet (Infected, Caused) As Andrea manages to free herself from her binds, a zombified Milton bites her on the neck, before being put down. Herself (Suicide) Later, she is found by Rick, Daryl, Michonne, and Tyreese. Andrea urges the group to allow her to kill herself so Rick hands her his revolver. As a tearful Michonne stays behind with Andrea, she shoots herself in the head.",
        "Killed Victims": "This list shows the victims Andrea has killed: Amy Harrison (Zombified) Shawn Greene (Zombified, alongside Shane and T-Dog ) Arnold Greene (Zombified, alongside her fellow survivors) Duncan (Zombified, alongside her fellow survivors) Lacey (Zombified, alongside her fellow survivors) Mr. Fischer (Zombified, alongside her fellow survivors) Mrs. Fischer (Zombified, alongside her fellow survivors) Annette Greene (Zombified) Michael Coleman (Zombified) Mike (Zombified) Terry (Zombified) Welles (Zombified) The Governor's Victims (Zombified) Milton Mamet (Zombified) Herself (Suicide) 6 unnamed Greene farm inhabitants (Zombified, alongside her fellow survivors) Numerous counts of zombies",

        "Trivia": "Andrea is the first main character to be killed in a season finale, the second being Abraham Ford , the third being Sasha Williams , and the fourth being Rosita Espinosa . Andrea is the last character to die in Season 3 . Andrea has had a sexual relationship with the main antagonist in both Season 2 and 3 ( Shane Walsh and The Governor ). Coincidentally, she initiated a sexual relationship with the main antagonists in the sixth episodes of the two seasons: \" Secrets \" and \" Hounded \". It was said by Laurie Holden that Andrea wasn't originally supposed to die in season 3, saying that Andrea was supposed to end up as the leader of Woodbury 's people, but it was changed three weeks before the shooting of the episode began. \"...Everyone was shocked,\" Holden says in one of her interviews, \"but this is The Walking Dead . Nothing is certain anymore.\", and it was Mazzara 's decision that no one supported. She said in one of her interviews that it was Mazarra's decision to kill her off for \"shock value\". She said, \"There was somebody in charge for Season 3, who thought that it was 'cool'... to kill Andrea, because he wanted the world to go \"Whatttt!?\" You know? So it was for shock. It wasn't a plan, it wasn't supposed to happen. I found out the day before, and it could've been anybody. He just wanted to kill somebody big--umm... you know, for shock. But he never read the comic book, really. So, he did not realize what he was doing, and we had to shoot it. I mean--because... you know, when you're working on a film, you have to do it, so. It was very sad, because Andrea was supposed to be there for the very end. So, it was sad for me. It was sad for my The Walking Dead family. The man lost his job because of that decision. But it was never supposed to happen, and you know Andrea was supposed to end up with Rick . So, this was one man's decision, who changed... history . You know? But it wasn't something that anybody supported. Not any writers, no--you know? It wasn't supposed to happen.\" [1] Something similar happened to her actual death scene. The one that was aired was re-written by Scott Gimple , while the original (which was written by Glen Mazzara) showed Andrea was bitten by Milton on the hand while still bound to the chair, screaming. In the end, Tyreese and Sasha were the ones who found her, and then the two freed Andrea from the chair. Sasha said that she would not leave her alone, but Andrea then insisted that Sasha should give her a gun. Sasha gave her what she wanted, and the two left Andrea to commit suicide. The shooting sound was then heard. Laurie Holden said at the Philadelphia's Walker Stalker Con 2017 \"I think the departure from book Andrea to the screen was a mistake. I mean, it's not like I couldn't pull it off. I think the whole stuff that they wrote about Andrea and the Governor was complete and utter nonsense. I did the best that I could to tell that narrative, and to justify it where Andrea kept her heart. I love Scott Gimple for giving me a gorgeous death with redemption so that you understood, and she wasn't a victim -- she died on her own terms. But I think that there was so much beautiful narrative that was lost and that she should have been there a long time, and been the leader that Robert Kirkman created in the comic book.\" According to Holden during her Q&A panel at Chicago's Walker Stalker Con 2014, she was contracted for 8 seasons before the decision of killing Andrea off was brought to the table. The only human that Andrea directly kills is herself. Laurie Holden auditioned for the role of Rick's wife Lori, but was instead cast as Andrea. Andrea is the third main character to predecease her comic counterpart, with the first being Dale Horvath , the second being Lori Grimes , the fourth being Carl Grimes , the fifth being Jesus , the sixth being Siddiq , and the seventh being Beta . In the episode \" No Sanctuary \", a walker appears with longer blonde hair and a handcuff on one of its wrists, possibly acting as a callback to Andrea's manner of death and meant to resemble her. \" What We Become \" marks the first time Andrea appears in some form after her death episode. In total, Andrea only makes two total episode appearances after her death, the other episode being \" Rest in Peace \". The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct implies her last name is \"Harrison\". Her surname was officially confirmed to be such, during a special commercial during the series finale which starred Laurie Holden herself as Andrea, listing her full name as Andrea Harrison . This makes her one of the fourteen TV Series characters whose comic counterparts initially lacked a known last name. The others being Amy Harrison , Dale Horvath , Carol Peletier , Sophia Peletier , Tyreese Williams , Eric Raleigh , Negan Smith , Lucille Smith , Ezekiel Sutton , Yumiko Okumura , Luke Abrams , Maxxine Mercer , and Kayla Brand . Andrea is one of the seven main characters to be mentioned or appear (in hallucinations, flashbacks, or dreams) in every season after their death, the others being Tara Chambler , Carl Grimes , Enid , Sasha Williams , Glenn Rhee , and Jesus . In Season 4, Andrea is first mentioned in the episode \" 30 Days Without An Accident \" when Michonne attempts to locate the Governor, then again by the Governor in the episode \" Too Far Gone \" saying that their two groups cannot coexist with each other \"not after Andrea,\" and later mentioned again in \" A \" when Michonne tells Carl that Andrea and his father helped to bring \"[her] back.\" In Season 5, Andrea is mentioned by Michonne in the episode \" Strangers \", telling Rick that she misses her. In Season 6, Andrea is mentioned by Glenn to Enid in the episode \" No Way Out \". In Season 7, Andrea is indirectly mentioned by Michonne to Rick in the episode \" Say Yes \". In Season 8, Rick mentions her death to Morales in \" Monsters \" as one of the people he's lost over the years. Later, after the death of Carl, Michonne tells Rick that Andrea \"brought [her] back\" in the episode \" Still Gotta Mean Something \". In Season 9, she is mentioned by Michonne in the episode \" What Comes After \". In Season 10, Andrea appears in Michonne's hallucinations in the episode \" What We Become \". In Season 11, Andrea appears in the form of flashbacks in the finale \" Rest in Peace \". Andrea is the second main character to be bitten by a walker, the first being Hershel Greene , the third being Bob Stookey , the fourth being Tyreese Williams , the fifth being Deanna Monroe , the sixth being Carl Grimes , and the seventh being Rosita Espinosa . Andrea is the second main character to die by being shot in the head, with the first being Dale Horvath , the third being The Governor , the fourth being Beth Greene , the fifth being Carl Grimes , and the sixth being Leah Shaw . A zombified Andrea appears alongside Milton Mamet , Gareth , and Rodney in a commercial created by Ryan Reynolds, advertising products such as DoorDash, Autodesk, Ring, and Deloitte. All of Andrea's named human kills were zombified, except herself. Andrea appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode \"Rest in Peace\". Additionally, Andrea is one of the many characters that can be heard speaking the words \"We're the ones who live.\" [2] In an interview with Scott Gimple, it was revealed that Laurie Holden and several other former The Walking Dead stars were going to return for the final episode, but the idea was cut due to scheduling conflicts, and was reduced to single-recorded lines. \"The speed we were moving at, it didn't seem we could do it visually in a way that seemed awesome,\" Gimple stated. \"This was scheduled in a very tight way, and we would've had to schedule multiple shoots throughout the country to do it. Also, you know in older seasons of Survivor , when they went directly from the last Tribal Council to the live event, and everybody looks completely different over the span of 30 seconds? I was a little worried about that too. Josh McDermitt's hair is blond right now. At the end of the day, looking at what we did editorially, I was pretty psyched, because it came through. And I suppose there's something to seeing the past.\" [2]",
