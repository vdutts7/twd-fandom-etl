        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "During the beginning of the outbreak, as Operation Cobalt was put into action in an attempt to try and contain the undead threat, Pope and a group of his people managed to escape the bombings by running until they reached an abandoned church, where inside Pope was amazed to see none of them had been killed or injured, leading him to view him and his comrades as \"the chosen ones\". It is unknown if Montanio was present during this revelation. Regardless, he eventually joined the Reapers. At some point, Montanio and his group eventually attacked a group of survivors led by Maggie Rhee despite having no previous hostilities with her group and succeeded in destroying their camp and killing numerous members of her group, causing them to flee to Virginia. He and his group eventually followed them to finish them all off due to his leader, Pope marking Maggie's group. During the hunt for Maggie Rhee and her team, Montanio locates the church where a severely wounded Alden is hiding out. Following a fight, Montanio kills Alden by slitting his throat, but Alden manages to kill the Reaper at the same time. Both men subsequently reanimate. While trying to get Pope to recruit Daryl into the Reapers , Leah mentions that Montanio and Nicholls are still missing since their attack on the Alexandrians and Wardens a couple days prior. After defeating the Reapers , Maggie returns to the church in search of Alden .
