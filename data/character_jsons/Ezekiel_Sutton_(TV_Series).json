        "Overview[]": "Ezekiel is described as \"wise\" and \"theatrical\". He is known to be caring for others, doing whatever he can for his people, including role playing royalty. Nonetheless, he does seem to be somewhat pompous and enjoys the spotlight. As well as his uncommon first name, he uses his experiences in theater to create the persona of a highly flamboyant and charismatic king, speaking in a Shakespearean-like manner and referring to himself in the third person. Despite his benevolence, he has an uneasy truce with the Saviors , and is shown to have a no nonsense attitude towards Gavin and his group. After the deaths of Benjamin and Richard , Ezekiel decides to join the fight with Rick Grimes against Negan Smith and the Saviors , becoming one of the three leaders of the Militia , alongside Rick and Maggie Rhee . After the deaths of several Kingdommers in a failed attack on the Chemical Plant Outpost as well as the death of his loyal pet Shiva by a zombie herd, Ezekiel becomes deeply depressed, considering himself responsible for the deaths of so many members of his community, as well as Shiva's. He tells Jerry that he's not his king anymore, completely losing his confidence. Later, Carol tries to motivate him with a speech in order to return to his role as the the Kingdom 's leader and get back in the battle, only for Ezekiel to respond that he just can't be a leader anymore. However, after Gavin and the Saviors come to the Kingdom with the order of Negan to capture Ezekiel and take him to be executed in front of his people, as well as making the Kingdommers go to the Sanctuary to rebuild it from a previous zombie attack led by Daryl , Ezekiel changes his mind and decides to save his people by having them get in a school bus and drive away from the Kingdom while he stays behind, being ready to sacrifice himself to save his people. He orders Carol to do the same like she had previously saved him. Following the fall of the Kingdom, his divorce and getting thyroid cancer , Ezekiel is left aimless and even, briefly, suicidal. Believing his condition to be terminal in the current world, Ezekiel becomes more and more despondent as his condition deteriorates and he joins Eugene's group mainly out of a desire to do one final good thing with his life. A rousing speech from Yumiko and Princess ' antics lift Ezekiel's spirits to a degree on their journey. Following the group's arrival at the Commonwealth , Ezekiel finds a new lease on life and a new purpose, particularly after the Commonwealth is successfully able to treat his cancer and save Ezekiel's life. Ezekiel greatly enjoys his new job as the Commonwealth's animal control officer which is similar to his old job from before the world ended of being a zookeeper, allowing Ezekiel to work with the animals that he loves once again on a daily basis. Seeing the class inequality, Ezekiel dedicates himself to helping those who can't afford things such as healthcare, bringing in Theo and even Tomi later to help him. Ezekiel dedicates himself to changing things to the point of refusing to leave when the Commonwealth and the Coalition go their separate ways. Ezekiel compares the Commonwealth to the Kingdom, stating that he wants to try to save another Kingdom before it falls. After being sent to a forced labor camp in the Commonwealth-occupied Alexandria, Ezekiel is reluctantly forced to work with Negan, a man whom he has avoided for years, to build a rebellion against the sadistic Warden . Ezekiel reveals that his hatred and bitterness are of a personal nature, blaming Negan for the murder of Benjamin who had been like a son to Ezekiel. Negan confronts Ezekiel over his decision to continue to live in bitterness rather than moving on with his life. Ezekiel eventually comes to Negan's defense, inspiring the prisoners to stand up to the Warden and the Warden's own men to turn on him. Ezekiel later tells Negan about the things that he has survived and that he no longer wants to live in the past with bitterness. Instead, Ezekiel wants to move forward and Negan living to make something positive out of his life will help with that. After returning to the Commonwealth, Ezekiel shows his leadership once again when, even with the overwhelming odds faced by the Coalition from Pamela Milton and the massive herd overrunning the Commonwealth, Ezekiel refuses to give up on it and inspires everyone to fight for the Commonwealth. After saving the Commonwealth, Ezekiel's leadership and dedication is recognized by the people that he had fought so hard for by them making Ezekiel the new governor of the Commonwealth and their leader, giving Ezekiel the chance to truly reform the corrupt system that Pamela and Lance Hornsby had shepherded.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Ezekiel grew up in North Carolina, although little is known regarding his early life. He had a mother and father, though his father eventually passed away due to unknown causes, as did his grandmother. In addition, his grandmother and father both developed thyroid cancer, but successfully fought it off. His mother served as a Sunday school teacher at church. At a young age, he performed in community theater where he portrayed several fictional kings including Arthur, Macbeth, as well as Martin Luther upon where he gained a distinct talent for theatricality. [2] In early adulthood, he studied at the University of North Carolina but did not complete his coursework. As an adult, he became a zookeeper. One day, a Bengal tiger named Shiva fell into a concrete moat and thus her leg was ripped open. With no veterinarians around, Ezekiel came to her rescue by wrapping his shirt around her open wound, preventing a hemorrhage. Grateful for his aid, Shiva never displayed any hostility towards Ezekiel and thus the two formed a close bond. [2]",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point after the outbreak, Ezekiel formed a community named the 'Kingdom' where his charismatic nature, tendency for theatrics and high respect by others firmly established his leadership position. He then proclaimed himself \"King\" with the support of his people. Later, he ordered the clearing of buildings to either expand or further safeguard the community. During one of these missions eight of his men were killed, including the father of Benjamin and Henry , who was a close friend of him. Several also had to have their arms and legs amputated due to being bitten. This incident made him more cautious. Sometime after this he encountered the Saviors and they struck a deal in which the Kingdom pays the Saviors weekly tributes in return for them not stepping foot inside the Kingdom. Ezekiel thus kept the deal hidden from his people with the fear they would want to fight back. His leadership was successful and the Kingdom became a thriving community.",
