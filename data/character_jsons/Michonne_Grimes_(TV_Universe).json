        "Michonne Grimes": "",
        "Overview[]": "Michonne is both a tough and a good hearted survivor. She tends to work alone and keeps much of her past secret, even towards Andrea, but possesses a keen sense of intuition. Michonne once said that she \"trusts her gut\" when it comes to other survivors. After the loss of her boyfriend, she suffered from hallucinations in which she would talk to him. It was revealed that she likes art and/or sculptures as she looted a cat sculpture and claimed that it was \"too damn gorgeous\" to leave behind. When she first comes to the group she is very quiet. As time goes on, however, she gradually opens up to the group, specifically Rick and Carl, and becomes accepted by the whole group. Michonne appeared to have an aversion to babies, as she vehemently refused to hold Rick's daughter Judith until Beth Greene forced her to, and, while looking at Judith, shed tears, before hugging Judith close. Michonne later establishes that this is a manifestation of the guilt she feels for losing her own son, Andre . Toward the end of the fifth season when the group is presented the offer to join Alexandria , unlike most of the group, Michonne is confident of Aaron 's good faith, showing an optimistic attitude contrasting with Rick's irrational distrust. Michonne assures Rick that they can't let that opportunity go if they want to stay sane, and encourages everyone to try and integrate in their new lifestyle, arguing that spending so much time without a sense of safety had nearly stripped the group out of their humanity. As part of this, she decides to \"live again\" and in response, hangs up her sword on the wall. When she next goes outside the walls again, for the first time in days, she starts to feel uncomfortable and is internally struggling with the want or need to be on the outside, and at the same time, finds solace the the fact that she did not reach for her sword. When she later sees Rick having his tantrum after beating up Pete , she quickly steps in and knocks him out to avoid the risk of the group being kicked out. Later, Michonne reluctantly agrees with Rick in the fact that Deanna 's leadership approach puts the community at risk. After Pete finds her sword and tries to kill Rick with it, ending in Reg 's death, Deanna allows Rick to execute Pete, tacitly admitting that killing is necessary in some cases. Due to this, Michonne debates putting the sword back on the wall. She decides to put it on her back again, indicating she's reached a balance between wanting to try and never wanting to forget. Eventually, Rick decides to confront the tyrannical rule of Negan and The Saviors , resulting in Alexandria's subjugation, Glenn and Abraham 's deaths, and Rick's complete loss of confidence and hope. Upon his decision of obeying Negan's abusive rules, Michonne tries to make Rick understand that that kind of life is no life at all, and that they should fight the tyranny to give everyone a better future, showing her optimistic outlook once again. Rick undestands Michonne's vision once Aaron is nearly beaten to death due to a simple misunderstanding with a Savior, making him admit that his judgement was clouded by the guilt, and starting to plan their insurrection against Negan. By Season 9 , and 18 months after the end of the war against the Saviors, Michonne has adopted a more peaceful and democratic way of leadership and is seen trying to unite all the communities to accomplish Carl's vision of rebuilding a civilization for the future. Six years later after Rick's supposed \"death\", Michonne has started to be hardened, colder, distrustful and cautious to newcomers, and is distant from other communities, mostly Hilltop. She is extremely suspicious of outsiders such as Magna's group , refusing to let them settle in Alexandria but relenting to take them to the Hilltop at the insistence of Judith. Michonne's attitude towards Magna's group softens overtime and she later tells Daryl that while she started helping them because Judith vouched for the group, Michonne is now willing to vouch for their trustworthiness herself. Due to the events of Jocelyn and her kids, Michonne has become distant from her oldest friends who treat her coldly to the point that Michonne feared what Maggie would do to her if they met again. She also refuses to mend bridges with the other communities in the way that people would like. However, the threat of the Whisperers has helped Michonne begin to reconcile at least somewhat with her friends, expressing her appreciation for Daryl's search for Rick's body and earning her the warm thanks of Tara for Michonne's help with the situation that had erupted. While initially angry at Aaron for his stance of keeping up communication with the other communities, Michonne later apologizes to him for her reaction.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Michonne grew up in Georgia, although not much is known about her early life. She originated from a middle-class academic realm family, where she grew up with a keen interest in both modern art and literature. In college, Michonne studied creative writing, computer science, art history and then creative writing again before dropping out. [3] During this time, she befriended Jocelyn . They would help each other with whatever struggles they had in their personal lives, primarily that of their dating lives, the death of Michonne's mother, and when Michonne was trying to get signatures for a petition. [4] At some point later in her life, Michonne entered into a relationship with her boyfriend Mike . They went on to have a son named Andre . The three lived together as an upper middle class family and enjoyed a privileged and lavish lifestyle. [5] Michonne also befriended Mike's closest friend Terry , whereupon the three came to share a valued interest in art. [5]",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At the onset of the outbreak, Michonne found a katana upon which she honed her survival skills to perfection as a result of encountering and killing walkers day-by-day. [6] Sometime later Michonne, Mike, Terry, and Andre journeyed to a refugee camp where they settled. Over time, several members abandoned the camp due to events worsening. Michonne chose to remain there despite this, which often resulted in several arguments between the three. Mike then began to express a resignation to live. [5] After arriving back from a supply run, Michonne tragically discovered the camp had been overrun. At the time, Mike and Terry had been high on drugs and were unable to fight, which resulted in Andre being devoured by walkers and the two becoming bitten. Experiencing bitterness and hatred, Michonne coldly allowed them to turn, amputated their arms and lower jaws and chained them up. For the next months, Michonne traveled with them closely behind her at all times to avoid being seen by walkers, as their undead status provided camouflage. [7] Morally broken from her losses, Michonne spent her time aimlessly surviving alone, keeping low and avoiding all contact with other survivors who she encountered. [8]",

        "Appearances[]": "",
        "Trivia[]": "Michonne was originally slated to have a cameo appearance in \" Days Gone Bye \", but it was never filmed. Glen Mazzara admitted during his Q&A at comicbook.com that Michonne and the Governor were the hardest characters to cast. Robert Kirkman stated 'We looked at a lot of talented people that were really fantastic but we were waiting for that one spark, that one moment where everyone was completely in agreement and completely excited and we felt like we had the essence of this fictional character that just randomly appeared in another person, and that person was Danai Gurira . She kind of came in and really blew us all away. She's got incredible presence, and she's got a theatre background, and is very physical and was just perfect for the role.' In preparation for the role Gurira practiced swordsmanship with a sword instructor, additionally she viewed several samurai films. 'I worked with a sword master - he's also a stunt man' - Gurira explained 'you just work very intensively. We just worked all the time. She wasn't trained in the bamboo forests of Japan. She figured it out, but there are aspects of even the way she's portrayed in the comic book where there's just a calm about how she utilizes it that I found very interesting.' Upon discussing on implementing the comic book counterpart traits, Danai stated \"I was trying to really investigate a character and allow her to have as much dimension as possible and crack it open even more. What you see through the writing and vision of the creator, you add to it by bringing your full humanity and by really delving into the character's background and their motives and fears; all those things can make a multidimensional character come to life. That's how I've been trained from the beginning and how I've created characters in the past on the stage or through my playwriting. I plan to bring all of that to the table to allow Michonne to be as rich and complex as possible. I'm excited to bring her to life as someone who really has a lot of life and a lot of complexity. [9] She owns a personal necklace as a memento. [10] Just like her comic counterpart, Michonne's signature weapon is a katana which she found at the start of the apocalypse. While not confirmed on the show, many instances allude to Michonne's profession pre-apocalypse being a lawyer, like her comic counterpart. Michonne's knowledge of laws, acting to construct governing laws in the communities, her techniques when interrogating new survivors, her familiarity with prison tattoos as noted with Magna's , and her pre-apocalypse affluent lifestyle that could be afforded by being a lawyer all allude to that being her profession. Even though Michonne and Rick never got married, Angela Kang revealed in an interview \"They were a committed couple to each other but were not officially married and they were both OK with that. For all intents and purposes, she was Rick's wife. That's kind of our thinking about it.\" Rick ends up actually proposing to Michonne in \" Become \". Michonne has caused the most amputations out of all other characters. Michonne has killed the eighth largest amount of living characters with a total of at least 43 victims, Morgan has the seventh largest with at least 45, The Governor has the sixth largest with at least 62, Rick has the fifth largest with at least 68, Daryl has the fourth largest with at least 78, Carol has the third largest with at least 102, Simon has the second largest with at least 172, and Negan has the largest with at least 225. Michonne is the third longest living female character in the TV Series, the second longest being Maggie and the longest being Carol. Michonne is one of the six TV Universe characters to appear in The Ones Who Live , the others being Rick Grimes , Anne , Aiden , Bailey , and Gabriel Stokes . Michonne is one of the twelve characters in the TV universe to be pregnant during the events of the apocalypse. The others being Maggie Rhee , Lori Grimes , Eileen , Ava , Vida , an unnamed Sanctuary Worker , an unnamed Kingdommer , Jane Carroll , Rosita Espinosa , Nabila , Grace Mukherjee , and Rachel . It has been confirmed that Season 10 is going to be Danai Gurira's final season, appearing only in a handful of episodes. This is proven true, as she appeared in five episodes and her final episode is \" What We Become \". However, she made a surprise return in \" Rest in Peace \". In Season 9 , Michonne, like Daryl, bares a X shaped scar on her back. \" Scars \" reveals she was branded this scar by Winnie , on Jocelyn 's orders. Michonne is the fifth most-appearing character, having appeared in 95 episodes. Michonne's last name was confirmed to be Hawthorne in The Walking Dead: Onslaught . It is interesting to note that the last name has not been used in credits or on the show nor has it been mentioned by any of the cast and crew in interviews and other media. The surname Hawthorne is solely referenced to in The Walking Dead: Onslaught . However, Angela Kang later confirmed on Twitter that Michonne's surname was indeed Hawthorne. Unlike her comic counterpart, it's her maiden name rather than her married name. [2] Michonne is a playable character in other media such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Mobile , Magic: The Gathering , Brawlhalla , and recently Fortnite where she and Daryl Dixon were simply abducted by John Jones . In \" A Certain Doom \", Michonne is mentioned by Daryl as he sets traps with Carol as they talk about her mission to find Rick. Michonne appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of \" Lockdown \", \" A New Deal \", \" Variant \" and \" Outpost 22 \" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins. Michonne has been captured eight times. She was temporarily captured in the episode \" This Sorrowful Life \" by Merle . She was temporarily captured second time in the episode \" Dead Weight \" by Philip alongside Hershel . She was captured in the episode \" A \" by Gareth at Terminus . She was captured again in the episode \" East \" by Saviors led by Dwight . In a flashback, she was captured in the episode \" Scars \" by Jocelyn's group . She was captured years later in the episode \" The Calm Before \" by Whisperers alongside Daryl, Carol and Yumiko . She was captured in the episode \" What We Become \" by Virgil . She was captured by the CRM in \" Gone \" of The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live . However, it was Rick who captured her, and it was a part of a plan between Rick and Michonne. Michonne is one of twelve characters to survive the TV Series who also survive in the Comic Series , the others being Maggie Rhee , Eugene Porter , Aaron , Hershel Rhee , Negan Smith , Magna , Yumiko Okumura , Lydia , Juanita Sanchez , Michael Mercer , and Pamela Milton . Michonne and Maggie Rhee are the only characters introduced in Season 2 that are confirmed to be alive. Michonne, Maggie, and Nate are the only characters introduced in Season 2 to not die in the TV Series . It's possible that Michonne's fake name she uses in the Civic Republic, Dana Bethune, is a reference to her actress Danai Gurira and to civil rights activist Mary Bethune . In \" Bye \", broke a previous record number of 68 walker kills at the Harvest Point culling facility as mentioned in \" What We \". This record presumably refers to the number of kills gotten in a single day, not the number of kills total. The previous holder of this record was Rick. According to Danai Gurira, the moment Michonne started falling in love with Rick, albeit subconsciously, was when he bit out Joe 's jugular in \" A \". [11]",
