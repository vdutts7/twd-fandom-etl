        "Overview[]": "Max is a plucky and kind individual. She is first heard when she makes contact with Eugene over a radio, going by the alias Stephanie. The two begin to bond and after finding out their communities are not far apart, they make plans to meet each other. However, after Eugene and his group arrive at the Commonwealth , another person impersonates Max to get information on his community . Fearing she would endanger Eugene, she stays back to not interfere with his happiness. After fake Stephanie's true identity is revealed, she reveals that she is the real Stephanie. Max appears to be quite intelligent, shown when she was able to make her radio out of parts found in the trash. She is shown to be somewhat nerdy, similar to Eugene, with the two bonding over things like comets and a novel Eugene plans on writing. Max soon becomes aware of the corruption within the Commonwealth. When Tyler Davis confronts Pamela and takes Max hostage she whispers to him, \"I'm like you.\" After she finds out about Sebastian 's heist, she angrily confronts her brother, Michael , who knew about it. She begins to rebel against Pamela and makes her own investigations and eventually finds a list with many more names of people who were sacrificed. Soon Max becomes a key player in the downfall of the Miltons, as she is able to trick Sebastian in exposing himself and his mother by secretly recording him.",

One of the residents, former President William Milton , converted the city into a civilization aimed at restoring the old world. By allying themselves with communities in the Midwestern and Southern regions, it became known as the Commonwealth . Michael, due to being a West Point graduate and U.S. Marine, was appointed General of the Commonwealth Army . Through Michael's connections, Max became an executive assistant to Milton's daughter, Pamela , for over ten years. After William's death, he was succeeded by Pamela.

        "Trivia[]": "Shortly after the promo photos for \"Out of the Ashes\" were released, AMC re-credited this character as Max (rather than Stephanie) in an attempt to avoid giving away any plotline spoilers and hide her true identity. However, in a slight subversion from the comics, it ended up being revealed that her name actually is \"Max\". Max is one of the fourteen TV Series characters whose comic counterparts lack a known last name. The others being Amy Harrison , Andrea Harrison , Dale Horvath , Carol Peletier , Sophia Peletier , Tyreese Williams , Eric Raleigh , Negan Smith , Lucille Smith , Ezekiel Sutton , Yumiko Okumura , Luke Abrams , and Kayla Brand . Max is also the first character of the TV Series whose first name was changed differently compared to her comic counterpart. That being said, she does fill out a similar role to that of Maxwell Hawkins with being Pamela 's personal assistant and sharing a similar forename. Max is the only main character left in Season 11C who is credited under \"Also Starring\". Max is the twelfth main character to outlive her comic book counterpart , with the first being Shane Walsh , the second being Carol Peletier , the third being Tyreese Williams , the fourth being Beth Greene , the fifth being Judith Grimes , the sixth being Morgan Jones , the seventh being Abraham Ford , the eighth being Rosita Espinosa , the tenth being Alpha , and the eleventh being Gabriel Stokes . Max is shown killing a walker for the first time during the fight in the streets in \" Rest in Peace \" just before Jules is bitten. Max is shown to be married to Eugene in the one year time skip. It's possible she changed her surname to \"Porter\". Max is one of six characters to survive the TV Series who died in the Comic Series , the others being Rick Grimes , Carol Peletier , Judith Grimes , Gabriel Stokes , and Ezekiel Sutton .",
