        "Cyndie": "",
        "Overview[]": "Cyndie is a compassionate, brave, idealistic, and helpful young woman. Unlike many in Oceanside who have become ruthless and brutal after the Saviors killed all the males above the age of 10, Cyndie is merciful towards outsiders and often goes against protocol to kill on sight. This is shown when she prevents Rachel and the other Oceansiders from killing Tara , even helping her escape as long as she swears not to reveal Oceanside's location. Though she is hurt when Tara breaks this promise, Cyndie is among the few to consider joining Rick 's group in the fight against the Saviors, but is forbidden by her grandmother, Natania , to do so. After Enid kills Natania, Cyndie is forced to step up as the leader of Oceanside. Despite having killed her grandmother, Cyndie allows Enid along with Aaron to leave. However, it seems that she has taken on her grandmother's mindset and now refuses to join the war against the Saviors. Aaron stays at Oceanside and continues to try to convince her to join the fight. She initially ignores him, but later hears him out. He tells them that the Saviors are the reason they constantly live in fear and begs them to join the fight. During the final battle against the Saviors, it's revealed that Cyndie had listened to Aaron and finally decided to join the war. Just as the Saviors arrive to slaughter the people at Hilltop , Cyndie and the Oceansiders throw Molotov cocktails and save the town. Now with the Saviors defeated, Cyndie lets go of the untrusting ways Oceanside carried for so long and integrated her community with the others. However, Cyndie and the other Oceansiders still harbor resentment towards the Saviors that had raided their home and killed all the men. After seeing Maggie execute Gregory for his crimes, Cyndie becomes inspired to get revenge on the Saviors that had killed their own. They kill Justin , who murdered Beatrice 's husband and then Arat who killed Cyndie's brother with no remorse. In Season 10 , Cyndie helps with the war against the Whisperers and allowed training on the Oceanside beaches, which is in contrast to back when the group was fighting the Saviors. Though Cyndie noticeably doesn't appear that often, when she does she helps out whenever she can. In Season 11 , Cyndie is largely absent throughout the season due to setting out on an expedition at sea in the passing four months. But is known to have shared her leadership responsibilities with Rachel Ward , during her extended absence.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Nothing is known about Cyndie's life prior to or as the outbreak began, except that she had a mother, brother, and was close with her grandmother . At one point, she attended the county fair where she once fought with her brother on a canoe ride.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Cyndie, her mother, younger brother, and grandmother survived the early stages of the outbreak and eventually formed a community of survivors situated at Hollowbranch where they enjoyed a peaceful existence. Unfortunately, her group would be discovered by a large, hostile organization of survivors led by Simon (who later became Negan Smith 's ruthless and sadistic second-in-command) and under his orders, Cyndie and her people were forced to gather and provide supplies for them under threat of death. Eventually, under her grandmother's orders, the group initiated a rebellion to fight back against their oppressors. However, due to being outgunned and outnumbered, their group was defeated and suffered many casualties, with Cyndie's mother being among them. As punishment for their defiance and to deter any further resistance, Simon had his group murder every male survivor above the age of 10. Despite her pleas, Cyndie's 11-year-old brother was personally and sadistically murdered by a woman named Arat , earning Cyndie's hatred. Following this and being unwilling to continue working for Simon and his group, Cyndie and her group, consisting mainly of females now, fled their community and established a new home at a location called Oceanside and reestablished their community hidden from them. In order to prevent Simon and his group from finding them again, Natania ordered any survivor who happened upon the community to be immediately killed in order to maintain the secrecy of their new home.",
        "Killed Victims[]": "This list shows the victims Cyndie has killed: Wade (Possibly) Arat At least 18 unnamed Saviors (Alongside her fellow Oceansiders) Possibly a few unnamed Whisperers Numerous counts of zombies and unnamed people",
        "Appearances[]": "",
        "Trivia[]": "The casting call for this character used the name Jennie . [2] Cyndie was described as \"Kind, with a world-weary toughness. Great with a weapon, but doesn't want to use them if she doesn't have to. She has survived the loss of most of her loved ones and makes an active choice to maintain a level of idealism and hope in the face of grief and trauma.\" Cyndie and Rachel Ward are the youngest community leaders in the TV Series, only being in their late teens. They along with Marlon , Violet , and Clementine are the youngest community leaders ever introduced in the The Walking Dead franchise. Sydney Park was unable to film for the episode \" The Calm Before \" due to scheduling conflicts. Had Cyndie appeared in this episode, Cyndie would've followed the ongoing trend of her appearing in the fifteenth episode of every season since her first appearance. In \" A New Deal \", Cyndie is mentioned by Aaron as they plan to deliver aid to Oceanside and update them on events with the Commonwealth , confirming that, before Lance Hornsby 's occupation of the community, she was still active in Oceanside and apparently sharing leadership with Rachel Ward , despite not appearing on-screen since \" The World Before \". Angela Kang believes that Cyndie's absence throughout the Final Season was due to being out on a sailing expedition to explore and scavenge. [3] According to The Walking Dead Universe Roleplaying Game , after Cyndie left on her expedition, her boat was caught in a storm and sunk. She wandered west and ended up in the Atlanta area, joining a local group of survivors who inhabited three old tour boats on Lake Lanier. Unfortunately, everyone in the group (except Cyndie) was killed by a virulent disease. Cyndie is the only character from Oceanside, to not make an appearance in the Final Season . Cyndie appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode \" Rest in Peace \". Cyndie is one of eight characters introduced in Season 7 that are confirmed to be alive, the others being Ezekiel Sutton , Jerry , Dianne , Nabila , Theresa , Douglas , and Rachel Ward .",
