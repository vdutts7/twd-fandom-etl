        "Post-Apocalypse": "Rowan joined the Woodbury settlement at one point and lavished in the return to normalcy that was given to her and others. She grew increasingly close to the Governor until she eventually became his lover (albeit presumably in secret). The morning after Andrea and Michonne arrive in Woodbury, they are given a tour around town by Rowan. As they walk up the main street, she talks about how there are 73 people living in Woodbury, and the 74th is on its way, referencing to Eileen who is heavily pregnant and walks by saying hello to Rowan. Later that afternoon, she is among the townspeople to crowd around the newly-acquired military vehicles brought in by the Governor's men and listens to the leader's speech. That night, Rowan is asleep naked in the Governor's bed. Following the failed prison assault , Rowan's fate is unclear. However, she is most likely dead as it is likely she was among the Woodbury soldiers killed during the prison raid or massacred by the Governor out on the road as she was not seen with the remaining Woodburians arriving at the prison.
