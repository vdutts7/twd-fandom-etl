At the Commonwealth Tribune newspaper office, Jan is going over the next issue's spread with Connie , Kelly , and another worker. Jan informs the worker that the issue is approved for printing and as he walks away, Connie interjects, saying the issue is not done. Jan motions for the the worker to proceed as planned and has a heated discussion with Connie, who believes that they should be chasing the Tyler Davis story. Jan disagrees, stating that the doctors have diagnosed Tyler with mental health issues and there is no deeper story. She berates Connie for not doing her job and orders her to follow directions next time. Jan later assigns Connie to do a story on General Mercer and the Commonwealth Army. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Jan's fate is left unknown. It is possible she was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",
