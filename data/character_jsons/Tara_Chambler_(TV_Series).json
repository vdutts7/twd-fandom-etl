        "Tara Chambler": "Tara Chambler",
        "Overview[]": "Tara initially came off as cold and hostile upon meeting The Governor as he made his way into her family's apartment building. She was seen exhibiting varying degrees of rude behavior towards him, even when Lilly insisted it wasn't necessary. As her character continues to be explored, we see that Tara's hard exterior is only a fa√ßade, which she presumably puts on for reasons of self-preservation or insecurity. In later appearances, she demonstrates a more friendly, compassionate, and honest nature. She is shown to be playful at times, such as when she played a game of tag with Meghan , as well as when she expressed amusement at finding a yo-yo in a discarded bag with Glenn and Rosita . Tara is shown to express severe guilt for her involvement in the attack on the Prison that ultimately caused its downfall, as well as the deaths of Hershel Greene and countless other residents; even though she had little to no influence on the actual fight, she still bears the brunt of responsibility by virtue of having been there at all. This guilt eventually subsides after Tara is accepted into Rick Grimes ' group and receives forgiveness from him, as well as Glenn Rhee and Maggie Greene . Throughout the fifth season, Tara shows numerous signs of developing emotional maturity and inner strength, often shown through her growing friendship with Eugene Porter . The strength and determination she exhibits later gives Eugene the courage to display those same traits, saving Tara's life after she herself is seriously wounded and rendered unconscious during a supply run for the Alexandria Safe Zone . By the eighth season, Tara has grown much more cold and vengeful, especially towards the Saviors , and she has a strong desire to kill them all, except for the workers and prisoners, to avenge her girlfriend, Denise Cloyd , and her friends, Glenn, Abraham Ford , and Olivia . This shows that she is perfectly willing to eliminate human threats, just like most of the rest of her group. She was particularly hostile towards Dwight , who was responsible for Denise's death, wanting to kill him despite his decision to switch sides and help them and conspiring with Daryl , who likewise wanted all of the Saviors dead regardless of whether or nor they surrendered and likewise particularly despised Dwight, to do so. She was also the only one who participated in Daryl's plot to let walkers into the Sanctuary despite knowing that innocent workers and prisoners would die if they did so, showing that like Daryl, she has allowed her hatred to blind her to what is the morally correct thing to do. However, after Dwight lures his fellow Saviors away from their location, Tara seems to soften, and remembers how she had once been one of the Governor's people, acknowledging her own hypocrisy. When she thought she had been shot with a poisoned arrow by Dwight and would die soon, she accepted this and said she thought she deserved it for the way she had behaved before, stating she may have pushed Dwight into switching sides again. After realizing he had shot her with a clean arrow and she was not dying, she seemed to finally let go of her hatred and told Daryl she would no longer aid him in his desire to kill Dwight and all the other Saviors. Following the 6-year time jump, and the deaths of Gregory and Jesus, as well as Maggie's departure, Tara has found herself as the leader of Hilltop. As a leader, she seems to be stern and pragmatic, but still kind, understanding, honest, and willing to listen to others. When Alden and Luke went missing, she wasn't willing to put an entire group of her people at risk to find them, by going out to face an unknown threat, preferring to return to Hilltop to get more information before acting. Though she appears certain in her decisions, she openly admits to Yumiko Okumura that she doesn't know if she knows what she's doing, inviting her to talk to her if she ever disagrees with one of her decisions, and is also quick to forgive Yumiko and her group for going against her orders to search for Luke, understanding their fear for the safety of their friend. In her final moments, Tara proved her bravery and strength of character, as she fought to the death against Whisperers , fighting to protect her friends until the very end.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Tara grew up in Atlanta with her father David, sister Lilly, and niece Meghan. She enrolled in the Atlanta police academy with aspirations to become a police officer. On a weekend, Tara and her girlfriend Sam were on a camping trip where Sam confessed she wasn't a lesbian as Tara had believed.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "During the onset of the outbreak, Tara's family picked her up from the academy and holed up together inside of their apartment complex. For about a year, Tara continually cleared their area of walkers. However, she was unaware that she needed to destroy the brain in order to kill one.",
        "Death[]": "Killed By Alpha (Alive, Off-Screen) In order to mark a border between the land belonging to the Whisperers and the communities, Alpha disguises herself and infiltrates the fair to kidnap several residents. Afterward, she decapitates them and then places their heads on wooden pikes to mark the border, with Tara being among them. Daryl Dixon , Carol Peletier , Michonne Grimes , or Yumiko Okumura (Zombified, Off-Screen) After finding the border, her zombified head is put down by either Daryl, Carol, Michonne, or Yumiko.",
