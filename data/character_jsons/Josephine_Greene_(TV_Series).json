She presumably helped work on the farm along with the rest of the Greene family and tend to what needed to be done (such as caring for the livestock). She dealt with Hershel's alcoholism and frequently made him sleep on the downstairs couch when he returned drunk from bars. Josephine bought back Hershel's pocket watch after he had given it away for alcohol. She returned it to him after he sobered up. She gave birth to her daughter, Maggie . Josephine died sometime around the early 1990's of an illness , leading Hershel to remarry a woman named Annette and later they have a daughter together named Beth .",
