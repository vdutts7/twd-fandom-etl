        "Overview[]": "Gregory is shown to be an arrogant, disrespectful, narcissistic, egotistical, and cowardly man. He appeared to have enjoyed being the leader of the Hilltop and having everyone under his control, and seemed to be a somewhat effective leader due to keeping many people alive during the apocalypse. Despite this, Gregory is a weak survivor who has cowered in the dark while others have risked their lives to protect him as he himself has revealed that he has killed not a single walker or human in the years since the zombie outbreak, showing that he is completely ineffective in combat. He has also allowed his people to suffer under the thumb of the Saviors, which has even cost some of his own people their lives and nearly cost him his own. Even after Negan ordered his own death, he still refuses to aid Rick and his group in fighting them and remains subservient to them fully, showing that he is completely ignorant to the cruelty of the Saviors. Gregory is shown to be completely selfish and treacherous as well and is only concerned about survival for himself as he leaves Gabriel behind following the attack on the Sanctuary even after the latter stopped and came back to rescue him. He's also an excellent liar: deceptive, unpredictable and deeply manipulative. By the start of Season 9 , Gregory is shown to be angered at losing his leadership over the Hilltop and is shown to have become even more unscrupulous and cruel as he attempts to use the grieving Earl to assassinate Maggie in order to reclaim his leadership position - claiming Maggie is a terrible leader who does not care for the people who die while attempting to fill out Rick's demands, ironically paralleling his own actions while leader of the Hilltop when attempting to fill out demands for Negan; this further exemplifies Gregory's arrogance and hypocrisy, which unfortunately proves to be his undoing when his assassination attempt fails miserably. He dies a selfish, horrible coward and meets a humiliating death at the hands of the woman who stripped him of the power he never deserved to hold over the Hilltop.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Not much is known about Gregory's life before the apocalypse except he was a business owner in Culpeper, Virginia. He once visited the Barrington House to attend a meeting for the Chamber of Commerce. During the meeting, Gregory admired the Barrington House and its artwork, wishing to own it someday.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point after the outbreak, Gregory journeyed to the Barrington House, as it was established a safe-zone put up by FEMA. However, due to Operation Cobalt , the safe-zone was abandoned. The survivors were left with the Barrington House and the trailers from FEMA. Gregory then took charge of the area and used the lumber and tools from a nearby mill to create the walls for what the people would later call their camp the Hilltop Colony . Immediately after the community's walls had been constructed, a ruthless group named \" The Saviors \" arrived upon and subdued the Hilltop, and they decided to prove that they were dangerous 'right off the bat' by killing a 16-year-old boy called Rory . Then, Gregory was personally interrogated by the invaders, which Gregory soon learned had been dispatched on behalf of their leader, an individual only known as \" Negan \". Gregory was forcibly subdued into allowing half of the Hilltop's supplies to be taken in exchange for leaving the community unscathed. However, the Saviors would often kill Hilltop's food deliveries in order to pressure Gregory into sending more supplies.",
        "Death[]": "Killed By Himself (Indirectly Caused) Earl Sutton (Indirectly Caused) Maggie Rhee (Caused) After Gregory tries to have Maggie killed by Earl Sutton and then himself, Maggie decides to execute him as punishment in order to prevent this from happening again. Daryl Dixon Despite Gregory's pleas, he is strung up to a newly-built gallows with a horse under him keeping him aloft. On Maggie's order, Daryl sends the horse away, hanging Gregory to death. He is put down before he can reanimate afterwards by Daryl as he was the one to cut him down.",
        "Killed Victims[]": "This list shows the victims Gregory has killed: Himself (Indirectly Caused)",

        "Trivia[]": "The casting call for this character used the name Rich . Gregory was described as \"50s to 60s. Narcissistic, egotistical, quick to braggadocio and anger, his own skin is his principal concern. He feeds off the superiority of being in control, but he plays it off with Senator-like charm. He's vibrant, and has the charisma of a car salesman.\" \"Rich\" is one of the names Gregory mistakes Rick for. Gregory also mistakes Maggie 's names in a few occasions, similarly to his graphic novel counterpart , who also had problems remembering people's names. Robert Kirkman commented on this saying it was a way to show that Gregory ultimately doesn't care about anyone other than himself, not even bothering learning people's names. Gregory is the second character to go from being a group leader to an antagonist, the first being Shane Walsh . It is revealed in \" Something They Need \" that Gregory hasn't killed a single walker or human throughout the apocalypse's duration and has to be saved by Maggie from a walker when he gets the chance to kill one. Ultimately, the only death he causes is his own. Gregory's last name was said to be \"Monroe\" on the official Skybound website. This was most likely an error, given that his last name has never been mentioned in the show or comics and there is already a Monroe family in the series that resides in Alexandria . [1] Gregory didn't appear in any season finales during his time on the show. He is the second main character on the show to not appear in three consecutive finales. The first being Merle Dixon . Gregory is the second main character to die in a season premiere. The first being Glenn Rhee . Abraham Ford technically doesn't count as his death occurred, off-screen, in the Season 6 finale . Gregory is the seventh series regular to die while being credited under \"Also Starring\", the first being Gareth , the second being Bob Stookey , the third being Deanna Monroe , the fourth being Jessie Anderson , the fifth being Spencer Monroe , the sixth being Simon , the eighth being Siddiq , and the ninth being Leah Shaw . Gregory is the sixth main character to later become an antagonist. The first being Shane Walsh , the second being Dwight , the third being Spencer Monroe , the fourth being Eugene Porter , the fifth being Anne , the seventh being Leah Shaw , the eighth being Lance Hornsby , and the ninth being Pamela Milton . Gregory is the tenth main character to be killed by another main character, the first being Dale Horvath , the second being Shane Walsh , the third being Merle Dixon , the fourth being Hershel Greene , the fifth being Gareth , the sixth being Abraham Ford , the seventh being Glenn Rhee , the eighth being Spencer Monroe , the ninth being Simon , the eleventh being Enid , the twelfth being Tara Chambler , the thirteenth being Alpha , the fourteenth being Leah Shaw , and the fifteenth being Lance Hornsby . Gregory and Jessie are the only two main characters that never appear after their death episodes in any capacity. Gregory is one of five Hilltop residents to be an antagonist, the others being Ethan , Andy , Earl Sutton , and Gage . Of these, Gregory and Ethan are the only two to not renounce their antagonistic ways. Gregory's death is ironic. The first episode he was introduced was titled \" Knots Untie \". His death consisted of him being hanged with a rope that was tied with a knot.",
