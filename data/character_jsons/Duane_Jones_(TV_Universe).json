        "Duane Jones": "Duane Jones",
        "Overview": "Duane is a kind, respectful, and humorous boy. He is shown to be very mature and obedient for his age, always listening to his father . He is very polite when talking with Rick , referring to him as \"sir.\" He remains optimistic when Rick believes his family is alive, saying they could be at Atlanta . He's also quite light-hearted, such as singing and dancing in the shower. Duane's mother had died in the early stages of the outbreak and is greatly saddened by her death. At some point after Rick and Morgan go their separate ways, Duane is confronted by a zombified Jenny and is unable to put her down. Morgan finally puts down Jenny, but not before Duane is bitten and eventually turns. Duane's death ends up haunting Morgan for the rest of his life, with his death being the main cause of his descent into madness. Years after his death, Morgan still thinks about Duane and mentions him on a few occasions. It's shown that Morgan's guilt over not being able to put Duane down still consumes him even over a decade later and impacts Morgan's ability to be a father to his adoptive daughter Mo to the point that Morgan struggles to even enter the house where Duane had died. However, when faced with a zombified Duane, Morgan is finally able to shoot his son and lay him to rest which appears to finally give Morgan peace on the loss of his family.",

However, due to the chaos and horrendous events which transpired around them, the family was reluctantly forced to take refuge and heavily barricade themselves within a nearby house. At an unknown point, Jenny was bitten and succumbed to the infection. Morgan was unable to put her down and released her into the outside. Following this tragic event, Duane was firmly overprotected by Morgan who created a sense of normalcy for Duane including correcting his grammar as well as engaging in mealtime prayers.",

        "Trivia": "The character's name is a reference to the 1968 film, Night of the Living Dead , which starred Duane Jones, an African-American actor who portrayed the lead character in the film, Ben. Duane is the second member of his family to die and turn into a walker. Duane is one of 9 survivors to still be listed as undead as of the end of the TV Series; the other 8 being Jim , Callaway , Pete Dolgen , Eric Raleigh , Winslow , Matias , Clara , and her husband Eddie . After the events of Fear the Walking Dead 's \" King County \", he is no longer zombified, having finally been put down by his father. In Fear the Walking Dead 's \" Skidmark \", Morgan tells Alicia Clark that his wife \"was\" Jenny and that his son \"is\" Duane, suggesting that Morgan never put him down. This is confirmed in \" King County \", when Morgan returns to finally put Duane down for good. Jenny and Duane are mentioned by Morgan in \" Alaska \" as he speaks to Rachel about staying healthy as a new mother. He mentions that Jenny had trouble keeping on weight to feed Duane, no matter how much Chinese food takeout Morgan brought home for them to eat. In \" One More \", Gabriel and Aaron drink the \"Duane Jones Bourbon\" which sold for $2000 a bottle, similar to the real Pappy Van Winkle's . The name could also be a reference to him or the real life actor he was named after. On the walls of Morgan's Houseboat in \" Remember What They Took From You \" is written \"Duane, Jenny, you were supposed to...\" and King County, Georgia . This is a reference to Morgan's lost family who died in King County. Duane spent the longest amount of time as a character zombified that was eventually put down, with twelve years between his living death and his undead death. He is one of two known characters to have lived longer as a walker than he did as a human. The other being Aimée , although she has yet to be put down. In an Instagram post , Lennie James reveals that the zombified Duane was played once again by Adrian Kali Turner in \" King County \". Despite being undead for over 12 years, Duane is shown to be relatively still intact. This is most likely due to him being in a closed environment and not out in the elements. Duane is one of the nine TV Universe characters to appear in Fear the Walking Dead , the others being Morgan Jones , Paul Rovia , Carol Peletier , Rick Grimes , Dwight , Sherry , Jenny Jones , and Negan Smith .",
