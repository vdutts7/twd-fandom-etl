        "Overview[]": "Kent, like many others in Alexandria , started as a weak survivor due to living safely inside the walls. When times get tough after the Wolves , he gets desperate and raids the food pantry with many others. However, he eventually learns to become a true survivor and when a huge herd of walkers get into Alexandria, he is among those to go out and help clear the herd. From there, he goes onto be a brave man, helping to fight back against the Saviors until his demise.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Nothing is known about Kent's life prior to or as the outbreak began.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point in the apocalypse, Kent joined a community called the Alexandria Safe Zone . Kent attends Deanna 's welcoming party for the new arrivals and socializes with the other residents and the new arrivals. As newcomer Rick and Jessie talk, he laughs while having a conversation with Barbara . Kent is among the townspeople present at the community forum to discuss Rick's fate. He is seated next to Barbara and listens to his fellow residents as they speak. Kent and the other residents are shocked when Rick suddenly arrives with the corpse of a walker as Tobin was speaking. He also witnesses the murder of Reg Monroe , which he is horrified at, and the subsequent execution of Pete Anderson . Having survived the assault made on the community by the Wolves , Kent is one of the many townspeople by the front gate, listening to the growing horde gathering outside the walls. He appears to be very concerned about the situation and listens to Rick and Aaron as they address the crowd. Afterwards, Kent along with several other residents attempt to raid the food of the pantry despite Olivia 's pleas until they are eventually calmed down by Spencer . Kent is among the Alexandrians that assists at Rosita 's machete lesson to learn how to defend themselves against walkers. He listens uncomfortably as Rosita talks to Eugene about death and how much harder it is to witness others dying around you versus dying yourself. Later that day, Kent attends Gabriel 's prayer circle with Bob , Barbara, Kyle , and several other Alexandrians when they witness Enid and Glenn 's green balloons floating in the sky, just before the wall is brought down by the collapsing church steeple, allowing the herd to invade Alexandria. Kent takes shelter inside one of the houses when the herd invades the community. That night, he witnesses Rick and other residents slaughtering walkers in the streets and is inspired to join the group where they battle the entire herd for hours until dawn when all the walkers are finally killed. Kent is present at the meeting in the church, listening to Rick's speech about the danger of the Saviors . When Rick asks if anyone objects to the idea of attacking the Saviors for supplies from the Hilltop Colony , he remains silent. Kent stands outside with Tobin and Francine watching the Saviors enter Alexandria to raid the community. Later that day, he is among the residents present at the church and is seated next to Barbara when Rick informs them that he is no longer in charge and that all guns need to be turned over to the Saviors. Kent walks by the Grimes' house, where he is greeted by Negan , who is holding Judith and talking to Carl . Kent is among the Alexandrians armed and ready to battle the Saviors alongside the Scavengers . He is stationed in the front of a house with several Alexandrians and Scavengers when suddenly, the Scavenger leader Jadis and her people turn their guns onto the Alexandrians. Kent and his fellow militia surrender but quickly open fire on the Scavengers when Carl ignites a shootout. However, Kent was ultimately among the Alexandrians killed in the battle against the Saviors and Scavengers. [1]",

        "Trivia[]": "Kent was credited in \" Start to Finish \" but did not appear in the episode. While David filmed for \" The First Day of the Rest of Your Life \", the majority of his scenes were cut, except for the quick shot of him before the Scavengers' betrayal, which is why the producers did not credit him for the episode.",
