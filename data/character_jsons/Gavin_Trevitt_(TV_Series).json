        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Dr. Gavin Trevitt was found after he fell from a first floor apartment building trying to get away from walkers. Dawn Lerner wanted Gavin alive at all costs, as he was a doctor. However, Dr. Steven Edwards thought he couldn't save him, as he had internal bleeding and a collapsed lung. Beth Greene (under orders from Steven) injects Gavin with 75mg of clozapine , causing him to seize and then flat-line. Gavin is then put down by Dawn before he can turn. Beth later finds out that Gavin was a colleague of Steven's and he purposely made her inject Gavin with the wrong medicine so that he could remain the only doctor at the hospital, ensuring that he didn't become disposable to Dawn and the other officers.",
