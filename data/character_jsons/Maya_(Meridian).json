The trio are joined by Gus and Ainsley , two other members of Maggie's group. Maya explains that the place they were staying in was set on fire, and that Jen and Billy didn't make it out, while Matty was killed by something in the woods. She didn't see who did it, but Gus is certain the Reapers are responsible. The group runs for cover as the unknown assailant takes shots at them. As Daryl and Maggie sneak through the woods, they hear another shot and a woman groan. Ainsley has been shot in the stomach. Unfortunately Daryl and Maggie can't help her, as they both agree that it's a trap. Maya, however, takes the bait, and is promptly shot in the chest. Before she dies, Maya points to a direction, which Maggie takes as a sign that she saw Hershel.",
