        "Merle Dixon": "Merle Dixon",
        "Overview[]": "A seemingly stereotypical Southern redneck, Merle is boorish, surly, abrasive, combustible, violent, racist, misogynistic, volatile, extremely ill-tempered, and quick to express his beliefs. However, Merle is also extremely humorous in nature and is a thrill seeker, who gets joy by mentally and emotionally toying with others. Much like his younger brother, Merle is an expert tracker and hunter. He is deadly with firearms, and in the third season, his hand-blade attachment proves to be one of his deadliest weapons. He is an experienced bruiser, showcased in the first season when he dominated T-Dog in a fist-fight, and at the same time was able to fend off Rick Grimes , Morales , and Glenn Rhee simultaneously. He also showed his fighting abilities when he took down Martinez in the brutal battle-royal event in Woodbury , and was able to fend off Michonne 's sword attacks with his hand-blade. After being left behind in Atlanta, Merle was found by the Governor and eventually became his right-hand man and a key member of the Woodbury Army. During this time he devolved into a ruthless killer who followed the Governor's lead without question, all the while striving to find his brother and take vengeance on Rick and T-Dog, who left him for dead on the roof in Atlanta . Though the Governor and Merle were allies, it seemed that Merle feared him to an extent and no doubt had issues with his authority looming over him at all times. While he was staying in Woodbury, Merle read many books, including the Bible, and even memorized verses of the Bible, showing that he is intelligent, and also possibly religious. When he later comes across Glenn and Maggie Greene and kidnaps and takes them back to Woodbury as prisoners, his crueler side is shown as he brutally interrogates Glenn and almost kills him for information on the location of his brother and their camp. However, Merle was still not completely incapable of empathy, as he offered his condolences to Andrea over the death of her sister, Amy . After the prison group came to the rescue of Glenn and Maggie, Merle was then branded as a traitor and a terrorist by the Governor for lying about killing Michonne which cost the Governor his eye and zombified daughter, and became an enemy of Woodbury. Merle escaped Woodbury alongside Daryl with aid from Rick and Maggie. It became apparent that between the Governor and Daryl, Merle was always loyal to his brother and knowingly discarded any chance of becoming a part of Woodbury again when he saw a chance to reunite himself with Daryl. After joining the prison group, his personality began to slightly change, appearing to lose some of his violent and racist tendencies. Merle realized that he had to coexist with the prison group and that not doing so would damage his relationship with Daryl. This causes Merle to examine his past mistakes and reevaluate himself. He is even shown to be searching for some forgiveness from those of the group who he had once wronged such as Michonne. He later attempts to fulfill the potential deal made by the Governor and Rick, which was an exchange of Michonne for peace between the two groups. However, he has a change of heart and releases her, instead opting to take on the group of Woodbury soldiers who had been planning an ambush. This would be his biggest and final act of redemption, as after taking down eight Woodbury soldiers, he is killed by the Governor, reanimates and is finally put down by his own brother. To the end of his life, Merle was a flawed man with issues that he kept himself from facing, but was never truly evil. He loved his brother and it drove him to keep fighting in a world filled with despair. His final act of courage gave his brother and the rest of the prison group a fighting chance and, perhaps for the first and only time in his life, Merle truly found his place among others.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Main article: Merle Dixon (Survival Instinct) Merle grew up in the mountains of Northern Georgia alongside his younger brother Daryl, under the roof of their neglectful redneck parents, their father, an abusive alcoholic alongside their chain-smoker mother. Because of the lack of love and guidance he was given, Merle chose to act out against society, which led him to frequently be incarcerated in juvenile institutions. He became frequently absent from Daryl's life, thus making Daryl resentful of his absence and as a role model in his childhood. At a young age, the brothers lost their mother in a house fire which had been caused by a cigarette while she was asleep or presumably drunk. Over the course of several years, they were mentally and physically abused by their father, which eventually caused Merle to abandon the family and join the military, claiming he would've killed their father otherwise. Unknown to Merle, Daryl was left to suffer from the abuse which resulted in severe scars located on his back. During the late 70s and early 80s, Merle and Daryl loved watching the sitcom Mork & Mindy . [1] During his time in the army, Merle punched a sergeant, which got him dishonorably discharged. He was then court-martialed and sent to prison for sixteen months. Merle reconnected with Daryl after the latter had an altercation with their father. Daryl followed his brother's lead, and they entered into a drifter lifestyle, where the pair utilized their survival instincts. He would also become involved in the contraband of crystal meth . At one point, the pair resided in Merle's drug supplier's house where the trio watched TV and by noon had become intoxicated, a discussion turned violent where the dealer punched his older brother, where Daryl retaliated by savagely beating the man. However, the dealer then threatened to shoot Daryl, a large argument ensued, which ended with the dealer punching Daryl in the gut, causing him to vomit. Merle and the dealer laughed the incident off. However, Merle would always care for his brother and look after his only support.",

        "Death[]": "Killed By Himself (Indirectly Caused) Zombies (Caused) Caesar Martinez and a few unnamed Woodbury Soldiers (Caused) Philip Blake (Alive) Instead of handing Michonne to the Governor, Merle chooses to ambush and attempt to kill the Governor himself. During the ambush, Merle is attacked by a walker and because of this he is captured by the Woodbury soldiers and is severally beaten. The Governor then grabs him and takes him back inside the building that Merle was shooting from. The Governor beats him, bites off two of his fingers on his left hand and breaks his right arm, before fatally shooting him in the heart. Daryl Dixon (Zombified) Later, Daryl comes across a zombified Merle and begins to cry uncontrollably. A zombified Merle approaches Daryl, who pushes him back three times before stabbing him in the shoulder, knocking him to the ground and then stabbing him seven times in the face, putting him down.",

        "Trivia[]": "Merle is the first major recurring secondary antagonist in the TV Series , with the second being Simon , the third being Beta , and the fourth being Leah Shaw . Additionally, he is the only main character who served as a secondary antagonist for half a season. Merle is also the first character on the show to have an antagonistic role for over a season and join the Survivors, the second being Eugene. Merle is the only major recurring secondary antagonist confirmed to have a living relative (his brother Daryl Dixon ). Merle is the first major recurring secondary antagonist to be killed by a major recurring primary antagonist, the second being Simon. Merle is the only major recurring secondary antagonist to renounce his antagonistic ways. Merle is the first Atlanta camp survivor to later become an antagonist, the second being Ed Peletier , the third being Shane Walsh and the fourth being Morales . Merle's words in \" Tell It to the Frogs \", when he is screaming, are almost identical to his last words to the Governor ; in the sense that both times he would not beg for his life against greater odds. Also, Merle's final line \"I ain't gonna beg, I ain't begging you!\" was not directed towards the Governor but rather God as revealed by Michael Rooker . Merle is the first human antagonist encountered in the TV Series following the outbreak. Daryl Dixon 's motorcycle was previously owned by Merle, but Merle is never seen riding it. The codename \"Stoney\" was used for Merle by the writing staff as seen on the call sheet for \" This Sorrowful Life \". According to Shane Walsh , Merle was a drug dealer before the apocalypse. In Merle's bag of drugs, Blue Sky Meth can be seen, a specific nod to another AMC television series, Breaking Bad . The scene where Merle starts shooting off his gun on the roof top in Season 1 caused a little bit of real-life chaos; some people did not know they were filming and thought that the actor, Michael Rooker, was a sniper and called the police. A real SWAT team actually showed up. Fortunately, no one was arrested and filming continued as usual. Norman Reedus , Daryl's actor originally auditioned for the role of Merle. He was turned down but the creators liked his acting so much that they decided to write in the character of Daryl specifically for him. Merle is one of the many amputees in the series, having been forced to amputate his own right hand, and later having two of his fingers bitten off by the Governor. Merle also has a tendency to call others with the names he makes up himself, with a number of them being ethnic slurs he uses against people of different minorities to show his racism. Daryl Dixon : Baby Brother , Little Brother , and Darlina (in Daryl's Hallucinations) Andrea Harrison : Blondie , Sugar Tits , Rug-Muncher , and Whore Morales : Taco Bender Theodore Douglas : Spear-Chucker and Mr. Yo Caesar Martinez : Brownie Gargulio : Neil Mexican Man : Beaner Mexican Woman : Señorita Michonne Hawthorne : Mute , Black Bitch , Nubian Queen , Sweetheart , and Darling Milton Mamet : Miltie Maggie Greene : The Farmer's Daughter , Honey , Bo-Peep , and Love-Birds (alongside Glenn) Rick Grimes : The Sheriff and Sheriff Rick Glenn Rhee : Chinese Kid and Love-Birds (alongside Maggie) Hershel Greene : The Farmer Michael Rooker lost 28 pounds in order to prepare for Merle's return in Season 3 . [2] In the TV Series , Merle is the first character to have a substitute appendage on an amputated limb. He is also the first main character in the TV Series to have an amputation, the second being Hershel Greene , the third being The Governor , the fourth being Bob Stookey , the fifth being Gareth , the sixth being Tyreese Williams , the seventh being Jessie Anderson , the eighth being Carl Grimes and the ninth being Aaron . Out of all these characters however, Merle is the only one to actually amputate his own limb himself and without the assistance of another; in this case he used a hacksaw to amputate his right hand to escape from a rooftop in Atlanta after being left behind by Rick and the rest of the group . Merle is the first original main character in the TV Series to die, the second being Beth Greene , the third being Sasha Williams and the fourth being Simon . Coincidentally, Merle and Beth were both very close to Daryl and their deaths made a huge impact on him. Also, they both appeared in the second episode of a season (the Season 1 episode \" Guts \" for Merle, and the Season 2 episode \" Bloodletting \" for Beth), and they both indirectly caused their own deaths and were shot dead by their arch-enemies (The Governor for Merle, and Dawn Lerner for Beth). \" Made to Suffer \" is the first episode where Merle and Daryl are physically seen together. Prior to his final shootout, he stated that he had killed 16 people since the apocalypse began. Although Merle was usually unafraid of anyone that he was shown interacting with in the TV series, the Governor was the first and only character in the TV Series whom Merle was afraid of. As said by Greg Nicotero during his, and Laurie Holden 's Q&A Panel at Walker Stalker Con Chicago 2014, Merle's death was not planned during the initial writing for the third season, his death came up on the last minutes before the shooting for \"This Sorrowful Life\" begun. Merle was supposed to be a recurring character in Season 4 . Merle's outfit is available for purchase on the Xbox Live Avatar Marketplace for 240 Microsoft Points. Merle is one of three characters in the series to appear in a program outside of The Walking Dead ; the others are Carol Peletier and his brother Daryl. Melissa McBride and Michael Rooker went into a 2013 episode of Conan O'Brien's talk show Conan , as Carol and Merle, in which the pair disrupts O'Brien's live studio audience under the guise of \"hiding from walkers\". Norman Reedus went into a 2015 episode of Saturday Night Live as Daryl, and shot Pete Davidson in the chest with a crossbow bolt during \"Weekend update\". In Season 1, Daryl is quoted as saying \"Nobody can kill Merle but Merle\". This would prove true as Merle's death is caused by him going on a suicide mission to kill the Governor. In an interview with Michael Rooker on comicbook.com, he was asked how Merle would react to Negan and what he has done to Daryl and the group as of Season 7 . Michael responded by saying \"I don't know if Merle would actually enjoy seeing his friends being abused.\" On Talking Dead Michael was asked if Merle would have sided with Negan, to which he replied \"If Negan had something for Merle; Merle would have gone with Negan, yeah. But he wouldn't have completely stayed with Negan especially if his brother is in the prison there. That would have turned it really quickly.\" Merle is the second main character to become a walker, the first being Shane Walsh , the third being Hershel Greene , the fourth being Deanna Monroe , the fifth being Spencer Monroe , the sixth being Sasha Williams , the seventh being Simon , the eight being Enid , the ninth being Tara Chambler , the tenth being Siddiq , the eleventh being Alpha , the twelfth being Alden , and the thirteenth being Lance Hornsby . Merle is the third main character to be killed by another main character, the first being Dale Horvath , the second being Shane Walsh , the fourth being Hershel Greene , the fifth being Gareth , the sixth being Abraham Ford , the seventh being Glenn Rhee , the eighth being Spencer Monroe , the ninth being Simon , the tenth being Gregory , the eleventh being Enid , the twelfth being Tara Chambler , the thirteenth being Alpha , the fourteenth being Leah Shaw , and the fifteenth being Lance Hornsby . According to Daryl Dixon , Merle occasionally got \"the clap\", which is slang for gonorrhea. This is the reasoning behind Merle having the antibiotics in his stash in \" Bloodletting \". Merle is the second main character to receive an amputation, with the first being Hershel Greene , the third being Bob Stookey , the fourth being Tyreese Williams , the fifth being Aaron , and the sixth being Lydia . Merle is the only character to self-administer an amputation. Merle appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of \" A New Deal \" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins.
