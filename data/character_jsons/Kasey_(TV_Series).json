        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Nothing is known about Kasey's life prior to or as the outbreak began.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point during the outbreak, Kasey joined a community in Ohio and became a florist, owning and operating Kasey's Kaleidoscope, including a stand in Union Square. Kasey tends to his shop cart in the town square as other residents come and go visiting his floral arrangements. Later that day, he is seen in a change of clothes tending to business within the Union Station building. Kasey walks around the main floor inside Union Station. Kasey is among the crowd of angry citizens gathered in Union Square demanding Sebastian be brought to justice. When the city is placed on lockdown, he reluctantly leaves the square with the crowd. Kasey attends the Founders' Day celebrations in Union Square with many other city residents. Later, he is among the excited festival attendees watching the wrestling match until a zombie outbreak caused mass panic in the square. As chaos enveloped the square, Kasey fled to safety. In the aftermath of the undead attack on the Founders' Day festivities, Kasey attempts to flee Union Square among the dozens of other civilians running and screaming. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Kasey's fate is left unknown. It is possible he was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",
