        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Sherry experienced an average childhood where she grew up in Virginia alongside her younger sister, Tina . During her youth, Sherry developed a fondness for looking after children and later became employed as a local babysitter, where she used to babysit Carla and Delly with the help of her sister, who later became diagnosed with diabetes and required insulin in order to help with her condition. As a young adult, Sherry met and befriended a local blue-collar worker named Dwight , where the pair soon fell in love and got married where the two lived together in a house somewhere in rural Virginia. Over time, they aspired to start a family of their own and thus would attempt to conceive a child together, however, their attempts ultimately proved futile.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "During the onset of the outbreak, Sherry was present alongside Dwight when the initial chaos and devastation occurred. The pair were forced to flee into a nearby forest which had become infested with a large herd of walkers. In an act of desperation, the pair utilized a large truck through opening the vehicle's valve in order to spread a trail of leaked gas water throughout the forest which they managed to ignite, creating a massive wildfire engulfing the pursuing walkers. After this event, Dwight and Sherry travel to Washington, D.C. and rescue Tina. At some point later, the trio somehow came into contact with a group of survivors known as \" the Saviors \", whom they subsequently joined and settled into a compound known as the Sanctuary , where they worked together to earn \"points\" in exchange for supplies. Over time, however, they grew to become fearful of the community leader, Negan , due to his violent sociopathic actions. Eventually, Tina fell behind on points and became unable to purchase the insulin which she so desperately required. Negan offered to marry her in exchange for no longer operating in a point capacity and therefore always having access to medication. However, acting on impulse, Dwight personally stole the medication and escaped from the compound with Sherry and Tina. At some point later, the three managed to take temporary refuge in the forest which they had previously inhabited. Shortly after, Negan discovered the trio had fled with the medicine and sent several Saviors after them.",
