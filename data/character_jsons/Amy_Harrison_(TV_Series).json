        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Amy was born in 1986, twelve years younger than Andrea and that caused no small amount of tension between the sisters. However, she was resentful of Andrea leaving her behind at home when she went to college and not coming back often enough to visit on her birthdays. She often went on many fishing trips with her father during her childhood. She was living in Atlanta where she was attending college and lived in a dorm room.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "During the onset of the outbreak, Amy and Andrea were heading back to Amy's college after their trip when they were stranded in Atlanta . As the city was overrun, they were rescued by Dale Horvath . Sometime later, they encountered and joined a campsite of survivors outside the outskirts of the city.",
        "Death[]": "Killed By Zombies (Alive) Amy exits Dale's RV bathroom to ask where the toilet paper is, when a walker comes out from behind and bites her in her arm. With Amy screaming in pain, the bent-over walker bites her collarbone, ripping out a small chunk. Andrea comes to her aid, but can't do anything as Amy dies from blood loss. Andrea Harrison (Zombified) After Amy succumbs to the infection and reanimates, a devastated Andrea apologizes for not being there for her before mercifully shooting her in the head, ending her suffering.",

        "Trivia[]": "Amy is the only recurring character to have a promotional poster in Season 1 . Amy is the first character to appear in every episode before her death. Amy is one of four characters to have their birthday acknowledged and celebrated after the apocalypse. The other three are Felix Carlucci , Gladys Cruz , and Mike Palmer . Ironically, Amy died the night before her birthday. In the original teleplay script for \" Days Gone Bye \", Amy's character was given the name Rachel (though her role remained otherwise unchanged). The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct implies her last name is \"Harrison\". Amy's surname was confirmed during a special commercial during the series finale which starred Laurie Holden as Andrea, listing her full name as Andrea Harrison . This makes her one of the fourteen TV Series characters whose comic counterparts initially lacked a known last name. The others being Andrea Harrison , Dale Horvath , Carol Peletier , Sophia Peletier , Tyreese Williams , Eric Raleigh , Negan Smith , Lucille Smith , Ezekiel Sutton , Yumiko Okumura , Luke Abrams , Maxxine Mercer , and Kayla Brand . Amy is the first named character killed by Andrea in the TV Series , albeit zombified."
