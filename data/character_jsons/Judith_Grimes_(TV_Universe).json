        "Overview[]": "Judith appears to be a kind, intelligent and caring young girl, mature beyond her years who is more than willing to protect others from harm, as shown when she protects Magna 's group from a horde of walkers . Even in her young age, Judith appears to already be very adapt with weapons and fighting against walkers, most likely having been taught how to use them by Michonne Grimes , as she is seen carrying a katana . According to Negan , Judith is just as much of a badass as her brother and is able to tell when someone is lying to her to the point that Negan never even tries. Due to Michonne's attempts at sheltering her, Judith has developed a bond with Negan who shares stories and helps her with her homework. Judith tells Michonne that while she knows that Negan is not her friend, she is sympathetic with his lonely situation while Negan affords Judith a great deal of respect in return. Judith has Michonne's fiery spirit and determination and as pointed out by Negan, hates taking things lying down just as much as Michonne does. Like Negan, she has a sarcastic sense of humor.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Judith Grimes is the second child born to Lori Grimes and is the first infant depicted having been born during the apocalypse. Her parents express hope that she will not live in constant fear as they do, and they wish that she will accept the post-apocalyptic world as the way things are without referencing the way things used to be. From the moment Lori discovers that she is pregnant with Judith, questions arise as to who the baby's biological father is. Lori has an affair with Shane , Rick's best friend, prior to her discovering that Rick is still alive. Rick later revealed that he knows that Judith is not his biological daughter, but he loves her regardless and is willing to protect her at all costs. Judith was born on June 20, 2011 in the West Georgia Correctional Facility . She was not immediately named upon her birth, and it took the group several days to decide on one. Carl suggested they name her \"Sophia\", after his late friend Sophia Peletier , and is nicknamed \"Lil' Ass Kicker\" by Daryl Dixon . Carl ultimately decided to name Judith after his third grade teacher, Judith Mueller .",

        "Trivia[]": "Robert Kirkman stated: \"If you've watched this show, it's definitely much more likely that it is Shane's baby, but you never really know.\" [2] Andrew Lincoln in a 2018 interview even claimed that Judith is not Rick's biological daughter but that he considers her his own. Even further this is confirmed on the show during Rick's dream as Shane asks Rick \"How's my little baby girl doing?\" As of Carl's death in \" Honor \", Judith has no known surviving blood relatives. Judith is the first of thirteen known children in the TV Series to be born into the apocalypse, the others being two unnamed infants living at the Kingdom , her best friend Gracie , Hershel Rhee , her brother R.J. , Ezra , Aliyah , Mariam , Adam Sutton , Socorro Espinosa , Celeste , and Rosie Porter . Out of them, Judith is the only one whose birth was shown on screen. Judith is, so far, one of the only seven known characters to be played by several different actors and actresses, the others being Michonne , Hannah , Mike , Terry , Paula and Hershel . However, she's the only one to be portrayed by multiple actresses at the same time. On Talking Dead , it is revealed Judith has 6 different sets of twin actors, plus a stunt doll for when the scenes were considered too unsafe for her actress. As of \" What Comes After \", Judith has been portrayed by 8 different sets of twin actors and 2 child actresses. This means she has 18 actors, the most of any character. The last set of twins, Chloe & Sophia Garcia-Frizzi , are the first ones to make it an entire season. She is the youngest character to have killed someone, in this case Lori Grimes , at the age of barely a few seconds old; albeit indirectly caused. Judith is the first recurring female character in the TV Series to both appear in and survive three or more seasons without ever being added to the main cast. Judith's first word was said in \" The First Day of the Rest of Your Life \", being \"Mama\".

As of the episode \" Honor \", she is the current owner of Rick's hat , following the death of her half-brother Carl Grimes . As of the episode \" What Comes After \", she is the current owner of Rick Grimes ' Colt Python revolver. Aside from a Colt Python, Judith also uses a Katana as a weapon of choice. Judith sees members of Rick's group as family members to her, such as seeing Maggie , Carol and Rosita as her \"aunts\" while Daryl and Aaron as her \"uncles\". Judith is one of two characters, the other being Paula , who has been portrayed by more than one actress in the same episode. In this case, the episodes were \" Mercy \", where she was portrayed by Kinsley Isla Dillon and Chloe & Sophia Garcia-Frizzi , and \" What Comes After \" and \" Scars \", where she was portrayed by Cailey Fleming and Chloe & Sophia Garcia-Frizzi. Judith and R.J. are the first adoptive siblings to appear in the TV Series . Judith is seventh most-appearing character on the TV Series, having appeared in 88 episodes so far.

Judith shares many similarities with Clementine from The Telltale Series : Both are/were nine years old during the apocalypse. Both lost their parents (Judith's biological father was killed by her future adoptive father while her biological mother passed away during her birth; Clementine's parents died in Savannah, Georgia shortly after the outbreak). Both were mature far beyond their years. Both were efficient in using firearms at a young age. Both owned walkie-talkies to talk to their loved ones. Both killed their first human in an act of self-defense and were emotionally affected by it (Judith killed a Whisperer during the assault on the Hilltop while Clementine killed the Stranger (Determinant) to protect herself and Lee ). Both were deeply traumatized when they had to put someone they knew out of their misery (Judith killed Earl Sutton after he turned while Clementine killed Lee (Determinant) to prevent reanimation). Both kept their father's former hat in a way to honor them. Both are/were taking care of a young boys named after fathers: Judith takes care of her adoptive brother named Rick Jr. (R.J. for short) when Clementine was taking care of a boy named Alvin Jr. (A.J. for short). Also both R.J. and A.J. look alike and have many similarities. Both were shot in the left shoulder. Both have dark brown hair and brown eyes. She is one of thirteen characters known to speak Spanish in the TV Series . The others are Rosita Espinosa , Juanita Sanchez , Morales , Dante , Gabriel Stokes , Miguel , Felipe , Guillermo , Abuela , Vazquez , and the Mexi can Family . Of the twelve, she and Gabriel are the only two of no known Hispanic descent. In an interview, Cailey Fleming confirms that Gracie is Judith's best friend. [3] Judith's codename is \"Shoto\" which is Japanese for short sword. Judith holds the longest lifespan of any child in the TV Series, lasting 155 episodes for nine seasons. Her brother Carl held the previous longest lifespan with 108 episodes. She surpassed him in \" The Storm \". Judith is one of six characters to survive the TV Series who died in the Comic Series , the others being Rick Grimes , Carol Peletier , Gabriel Stokes , Ezekiel Sutton , and Maxxine Mercer . During her final scene in the series, Judith is the same age that her brother Carl was in his very first scene in the series. Judith is one of four main characters in Season 11 who appears in all eight episodes of part three. The others three are Negan Smith , Daryl Dixon , and Ezekiel Sutton . However, her appearances in \" Variant \", \" What's Been Lost \", and \" Outpost 22 \" are voices only appearances and in \" Faith \" is archive footage only. Judith has the last line in the TV series and the first line in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon . In \" Deux Amours \" of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon , Daryl lists Judith as one of his friends that he misses in America when Laurent asks Daryl about his friends. Laurent later names Judith in his prayers since Daryl doesn't pray.
