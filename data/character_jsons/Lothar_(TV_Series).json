        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point during the outbreak, Lothar joined a community in Ohio. An announcer says to the crowd that the main event of the fair is about to begin: a wrestling match, which in truth is a staged fight between Captain Commonwealth versus him and Attila . Throughout the fight, the crowd cheers for Captain Commonwealth and boos whenever he and Attila gain the upper hand. Eventually, Captain beats the two and celebrates with the crowd. Later, when chaos ensues and walkers enter the square, Lothar flees to safety. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Lothar's fate is left unknown. It is possible he was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",
