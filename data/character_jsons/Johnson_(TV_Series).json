        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point during the outbreak, Johnson joined a community in Ohio. Johnson is present at the \"Kill House\" along with her fellow trainees. She is ordered to team up with Quintana by Mercer . Johnson attends the Founders' Day celebrations in Union Square with many other city residents. Later, she is among the excited festival attendees watching the wrestling match until a zombie outbreak caused mass panic in the square. As chaos enveloped the square, Johnson fled to safety. Johnson is among the city residents to attend the trial being held in Union Station regarding Eugene's role in the death of Sebastian Milton on Founders' Day. She and the other residents watch intently as the faux trial leans in Pamela's favor and murmurs displeasure and doubt when Pamela testifies that the lottery is about opportunity for all. She and the other citizens voice their agreement when Yumiko begins questioning Pamela and the lies her son revealed in the recording. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Johnson's fate is left unknown. It is possible she was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",
