        "Rachel Ward": "",
        "Overview[]": "Rachel is introduced as a cunning, somewhat cruel and formidable girl who is a very strong and determined survivor. Like a majority of her fellow Oceanside survivors following their enslavement and punishment at the hands of the Saviors , Rachel has become a battle hardened survivor willing to do whatever it takes in order to protect herself and those she cares about from harm. She is shown to be very capable of cold blooded murder as she suggested killing both Tara and Aaron and appears to be very enthusiastic about removing anything she perceives as a threat and is very untrustworthy towards strangers to her group. Even at an early age she is very formidable and effective in combat, being able to take walkers down herself and also helping to kill an entire group of Saviors with Molotov cocktails. She is somewhat rude as well, as she spits at Tara's feet while the latter was being escorted out of Oceanside. Even after the end of the war against the Saviors, Rachel is still shown to be bloodthirsty and fully agrees with her group members taking revenge against members of the Saviors, notably Justin and Arat , who were responsible for slaughtering their people following their failed rebellion. She even tried to help Maggie take her revenge on Negan by lying to Rick about passing along a message forbidding Maggie from entering Alexandria. 6 years later, Rachel is shown to have matured into an intelligent young woman and an effective group leader. She does not appear to be as bloodthirsty anymore due to the Saviors being completely disbanded though she is still willing to provide combat training to help fight back against the Whisperers. She aims to maintain strong relationships with her allies and work together closely again in order to ensure a prosperous future.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Nothing is known about Rachel's life prior to or as the outbreak began.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "Rachel survived the early stages of the outbreak and eventually found herself as a member of a large group of survivors led by a woman named Natania . Unfortunately, her group would be discovered by a large, hostile organization of survivors led by Simon (who later became Negan Smith 's ruthless and sadistic second-in-command) and under his orders, Rachel and her people were forced to gather and provide supplies for them under threat of death. Eventually, under Natiana's orders, the group initiated a rebellion to fight back against their oppressors. However, due to being outgunned and outnumbered, their group was defeated. As punishment for their defiance and to deter any further resistance, Simon had his group murder every male survivor above the age of 10 in Rachel's group. It is unknown if any of Rachel's family were among the casualties of the rebellion or subsequent massacre. Following this and being unwilling to continue working for Simon and his group, Rachel and her group, consisting mainly of females now, fled their community and established a new home at a location called Oceanside and reestablished their community hidden from them. In order to prevent Simon and his group from finding them again, Natania ordered any survivor who happened upon the community to be immediately killed in order to maintain the secrecy of their new home. Rachel overtime developed into a bloodthirsty killer willing to slaughter any outside survivor of her group.",
        "Killed Victims[]": "This list shows the victims Rachel has killed: Wade (Possibly) At least 18 unnamed Saviors (Alongside her fellow Oceansiders) 1 unnamed Whisperer (Alongside Coalition Archers) Possibly a few unnamed Commonwealth soldiers Numerous counts of zombies",

        "Trivia[]": "Rachel's last name, Ward , was not revealed until \"The Calm Before\" as she signed the community charter. She shares her name with the English-Australian actress of the same name Rachel Ward . Whether if this was intentional or not is unknown. With the death of Gage in \" Acheron: Part II \"\" and the disappearance of Alice , Rachel is now one of only two surviving named teenage characters, the other being Lydia . She also is one of eight characters introduced in Season 7 that are confirmed to be alive, the others being Ezekiel Sutton , Jerry , Dianne , Nabila , Theresa , Douglas , and Cyndie . Rachel Ward and Cyndie are the youngest community leaders in the TV Series, only being in their late teens. They along with Marlon , Violet , and Clementine are the youngest community leaders ever introduced in the The Walking Dead franchise. In \" A New Deal \", Rachel is mentioned by Aaron as they plan to deliver aid to Oceanside and update them on events with the Commonwealth. Angela Kang confirmed that originally Rachel and Oceanside were going to appear in the finale, but they were forced to cut it due to unforeseen circumstances. [2] Rachel appears in the final flashbacks of the last episode \" Rest in Peace \".",
