After finding out they were killed, Nate wants to get revenge on Rick's group, while Sean and Randall just want to leave. Though Rick tries to reason with them, Nate shoots at them and a gunfight ensues. Nate is even shown to be willing to leave his own group members behind, such as when Randall who injures himself, Nate drives off, though he is apologetic for this action. Ironically, Nate, who was the person who wanted a fight, was the only member of his group to make it out alive.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Nothing is known about Nate's life prior to or as the outbreak began.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point following the outbreak Nate joined a large group of survivors known as the Living . Nate is the third member of the group that came searching for Dave and Tony in the town. He, along with Randall and Sean , began firing at Rick Grimes , Glenn Rhee , and Hershel Greene when they discovered that Rick's group had killed Dave and Tony. During the stand-off, the sound of the firearms lured the walkers towards the bar . Realizing the town was becoming overrun with more and more Walkers, he decided to get the vehicle and prepared to escape. Finding Sean bitten and being devoured by the walkers, he drove the truck up to Steve's Pharmacy to allow Randall to jump down. When Randall missed, Nate didn't want to take any more chances and left, driving out of the town alone. His fate is still currently unknown since he drove off, although it can be assumed that he returned to his camp and informed the group about the deaths of Tony , Dave , Sean, and most likely Randall.",

Though, it's possible they are separate characters."
