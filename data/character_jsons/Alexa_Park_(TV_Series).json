        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point during the outbreak, Alexa was found injured in the wilderness and joined a community in Ohio. Starting in February 2021, she spent nine months painting a portrait of Pamela Milton 's father . Alexa is among the members of the Commonwealth's high society to attend the masquerade ball held at Union Station. She is praised by Pamela Milton during her speech and the unveiling of a beautiful painting of Pamela's father, a former US President. Pamela mentions that Alexa is one of the many people who sustained serious injuries out in the wasteland as a result of the apocalypse and was able to find home in the Commonwealth. Alexa is horrified when Tyler Davis takes a woman hostage and destroys her painting with a knife, but is relieved when she is freed. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Alexa's fate is left unknown. It is possible she was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",
