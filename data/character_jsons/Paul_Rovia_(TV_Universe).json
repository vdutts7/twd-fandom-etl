        "Paul Rovia": "Paul Rovia",
        "Overview": "Jesus is described as smart, friendly, and charming with a puckish sense of humor. It is stated that he can be a thief, but he'll only steal half of what someone has, and only if he knows it won't cause any permanent damage. He's generally shown to be a beloved guy and pretty much makes friends with everyone he meets. Jesus won't hesitate to kill in order to protect his friends, but he seems to show mercy to innocent people and the surrendering. This can be seen in \" The Damned \", when he prevents Tara Chambler from killing Dean , a Savior who claims to be a worker from the Sanctuary forced from his family. Later, he also prevents Morgan Jones from killing Jared stating that this isn't what they do. Jesus' ultimate plan is to let the Saviors live peacefully among the Hilltopers, after the war against Negan is over, believing they can redeem themselves. In \" Wrath \", Jesus' plan seems to become a reality after Rick Grimes has a change of heart because of his son 's death and he decides to let the Saviors live in order for all the communities to live in peace and rebuild civilization. Also, Maggie Rhee later agrees that Jesus was right about not killing all the Saviors, believing there are some people that can indeed change; an example being Alden and his group even though they were members of the Saviors. However, Maggie strongly disagrees with Rick and Michonne Hawthorne 's decision to let Negan live and she, as well as Jesus and Daryl Dixon , decide to show Rick that he's wrong. In \" Season 9 \", Jesus is now one of Maggie's closest friends and followers, always offering her advice. Six years after Rick's presumed death, Maggie leaves Hilltop with her son, leaving the leadership to Jesus. However, Jesus still feels that he isn't fit to be the leader and feels more comfortable exploring in the wilderness. Despite Alexandria being isolationist from the other communities, Jesus sees Aaron and talks with him so they don't lose full communication, showing that Jesus wants everyone to be united like they once were. When the group is surrounded by several walkers on a foggy graveyard, Jesus decides to stay behind and to give the group some time to escape, however, this heroic action would unknowingly cost him his own life. In the end, Jesus died a brave man willing to give his life to save his friends and despite not accepting it, he found his own place in the new world as a figure one could follow.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse": "Jesus grew up as an orphan in a group home in Virginia . For most of his life, Jesus grew up around a large number of children, which he became accustomed to, although he generally struggled in forming connections with other people. Openly gay, he still found difficulty in relationships with boyfriends. [2] As an adult, he managed to gather several friends. From them, he received the nickname \"Jesus\" due to his stereotypical Western resemblance to the religious figure Jesus Christ . Jesus trained in martial arts and became a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and learned the art of pick-pocketing and escapology. [3]",
        "Post-Apocalypse": "At some point after the outbreak, Jesus journeyed to a safe zone named the Hilltop Colony upon where he settled into and thus became effectively integrated with the fellow residents of the community. Jesus quickly befriended the community leader Gregory and the two developed a working partnership and thus he proved to become an invaluable member of the farming community. Benefitting from his abilities and experience, Jesus was appointed as the community's recruiter where he was assigned to scavenge for supplies as well as to locate other communities and settlements to trade with in order to establish a network to help contribute towards the Hilltop Colony in order to help maintain and prosper throughout the apocalypse. Jesus was present at the time of the arrival of a notorious group named \" The Saviors \" who operated on behalf of a man named Negan . During a meeting conducted by Gregory alongside a dispatched squadron, The Saviors demanded half of the Hilltop Colony's supplies in exchange for leaving the farming community unscathed. Though initially reluctant to agree, they eventually complied after witnessing the public execution of Rory , a 16-year-old resident of the community. Following this event, the Hilltop Colony entered into a period of dread and subjugation and thus were forced to comply under Negan's corrupt rule, as a result of their limited resources and manpower they were unable to rebel against their save oppressors. Throughout the following months, Jesus alongside the other residents begrudgingly worked to gather supplies in their desperate struggle in order to compensate with Negan's demands.",
        "Death": "Killed By Unnamed Whisperer As Jesus swings his sword to kill a \"walker\", it dodges and stabs him from behind through his chest. As he dies, the \"walker\" whispers in his ear, before throwing him on the ground. Aaron (Before Reanimation) Later, as the group prepares to leave the cemetery, Aaron stabs Jesus in the head to prevent reanimation.",
        "Killed Victims": "This list shows the victims Jesus has killed: Sasha Williams (Caused, Zombified) Kurt (Caused, Zombified) Lance (Alongside his fellow Militia members) 3 unnamed Saviors Numerous counts of zombies and possibly unnamed people",

        "Trivia": "The casting call for this character used the name Jason . Jesus was described as \"Late 20s to 30s. Caucasian/Latino. Smart, friendly, and charming with a puckish sense of humor. He can be a thief, but he'll only steal half of what you have, and only if he knows it won't cause any permanent damage. He's generally a benevolent guy who makes friends with everyone he meets.\" Unlike his comic book counterpart , Paul does not possess the surname \"Monroe\". That was probably done due to not make him erroneously accredited to the Monroe family. Paul prefers the nickname, \"Jesus\", as his friends at the Hilltop Colony call him that. This is due to his uncanny resemblance of Jesus Christ not only in appearance, but in behavior. Richard is the first character to refer to Jesus as Paul. Tom Payne on Jesus possibly being gay on the show : \"What I find interesting from the comics is that it's not a big deal. He just is who he is. And I enjoy the fact that in the show, they want to do right by the characters. So, um... you'll find out! What I will say is that the showrunners and everyone who works at the show respect the vision of the characters. We haven't gotten to that aspect of the character, but I think everyone will be happy.\" Robert Kirkman confirmed in Letterhacks #164 that Jesus is indeed gay on the show. This makes him the sixth LGBT character alongside Tara , Alisha , Aaron , Eric , and Denise being the third known gay male. Kari Skogland , the director of \" The Next World \", wanted a take of Jesus looking a naked Rick up and down and smiling. In addition, Tom Payne believes that Jesus was not unconscious in the car ride to Alexandria and intentionally fell onto Daryl's arm, indicating his attractions to Rick and Daryl. It was officially confirmed in \" The Other Side \" that he had trouble getting close to most people, including boyfriends. In the original script for \" A New Beginning \", Jesus was set to have a boyfriend. However, this was not included in the final version of the episode. It is unknown who his boyfriend was, or if the show intended to establish a character or select a Hilltop background extra to fulfill the role of the boyfriend. [4] In the original script of \" The Next World \", Jesus drops down into a horse stance, but the writers decided that they shouldn't give up that he's a super capable fighter. They instead worked on evasion techniques.

Besides the nickname of 'Jesus', Rovia's name is Biblically significant in several other ways 'Paul' was, of course, an Apostle, and 'Rovia' (presuming a middle initial of 'S') could be rearranged to spell 'Savior'.
