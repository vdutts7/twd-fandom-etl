        "Carol Peletier": "Carol Peletier",
        "Overview[]": "At the outset of the series, Carol is introverted and soft-spoken, though often meek and defenseless, particularly when it comes to facing her abusive husband, Ed . She remains fiercely protective over her daughter Sophia , attempting to shield her from the various dangers of their surroundings. After Ed is beaten half to death, Carol rebels against her husband's wishes for Sophia to spend time with him and begins to participate in group activities alone with their daughter. Due to Ed's loss, Carol slowly begins to empower herself. After Sophia's death, she begins to stand up for herself and gains more independence, while strengthening her bonds with the group. She is shown during the second season to be a devout Christian , frequently praying for the well-being of herself and Sophia. She fervently holds onto her Beliefs even after Sophia's death, insisting that her daughter is in heaven. Starting in the third season and more prominently in the fourth season, Carol later obtains a proactive and pragmatic stance when she secretly kills two sick members of the group in an attempt to prevent a deadly disease from spreading and shows little remorse over the deed, claiming that it was necessary. Rick deems Carol's actions morally questionable and exiles her. When Lizzie 's psychotic tendencies escalate to the extent of killing her younger sister, Mika , Carol feels obligated to kill her in order to protect her group: herself, Tyreese Williams , and Rick's daughter Judith . Later, Carol confesses to Tyreese, the boyfriend of Karen (one of the two ill members she kills) that she is responsible for the deaths and gains Tyreese's forgiveness. The difficult choices Carol makes to stay alive leave her emotionally wounded as a result. In the fifth season, her resourcefulness is exemplified when she wipes out of the cannibalistic death compound, Terminus , where the other survivors are held captive, saving them all from potential death. Doing so, she regains the respect and praise of Rick. Despite her initial hesitation to rejoin the newly established group permanently, she eventually welcomes the idea, she and is seen as a leader during the group's separation on their journey to Washington, D.C. Carol is revealed to be agnostic by the fifth season, revealing that she is no longer sure if she believes in God or an afterlife. Carol's development has revealed her to be highly intelligent, cunning, objective, and resourceful, serving as a reliable confidant and counselor to Rick, typically advising the most cerebral and analytical approach. She is not afraid to take matters into her own hands and is shown to be prepared to kill anyone whom she views as a threat. She is also a brilliant liar, as she is able to convince the entire town of Alexandria that she is a meek, incompetent older lady in an attempt to mask her much more savvy and skeptical personality. She still retains her sanity and her emotions of sympathy, but Carol will always take the logical route at any cost. Carol is occasionally shown to be extremely cold and cruel, as shown when she threatens to leave Sam for the Walkers if he tells of her presence in the gun gallery and coldly telling him to move on after his abusive father 's death. She also threatens and attempts to kill fellow group member Morgan Jones for getting in her way of killing Owen , the leader of the Wolves , despite the latter being confined and restrained. Carol is shown to be similar to Rick in the sense that both are unwilling to take chances when it comes to dealing with human threats and show an enthusiastic desire to kill them without hesitation. Starting in the back half of the sixth season, it is shown that she does feel remorse for killing people, writing down a list of the peoples she has killed as she begins to feel the weight of her actions since the apocalypse began. Deep down Carol desperately wants to believe what Morgan believes, but the facts haven't lined up like that for her. She's a hardened combat veteran but born out of necessity and reluctance. Around this time, she also confesses to considering herself the \"mother\" to all of the survivors and is able to do terrible things while maintaining her motherly side, to protect them. Her motherly side is shown in her threatening Pete Anderson for harming his family, as well as her refusal to let Maggie do anything dangerous, such as help in the assault on the Saviors while she is pregnant, going such lengths as to stick around to make sure Maggie doesn't slip away to protect her. Despite her remorse in killing other survivors, Carol is still very much capable of committing murder to keep herself and those she cares about safe from danger as shown when she kills an entire group of Saviors that kidnapped herself and Maggie and coldly guns down a member that nearly slashed the pregnant Maggie in the stomach with a knife. Following this, Carol chooses to exile herself from her group claiming she can no longer kill any more human threats. Carol, however, has not weakened in any way as she single-handedly takes down another small group of Saviors herself after they refused to surrender. In the season six finale, it seems like Carol is accepting her fate just like when she is nearly killed by the Savior who had survived her attack. After being rescued by Morgan and allowing herself to recover from her wounds at the Kingdom, Carol is still adamant about isolating herself from the world and hence leaves to live in a small house on the Kingdom's outskirts. Morgan and leader of the Kingdom, Ezekiel occasionally check up on her much to her annoyance. In her solitary life, Carol continues to believe in avoiding involvement in violent confrontation as she immediately rejected Richard's - Ezekiel's head of security - plea to incite war with the Saviors. However, after hearing from Morgan about the deaths of Glenn Rhee and Abraham Ford at the hands of Negan Smith , Carol returns to the Kingdom and tells Ezekiel they need to get ready to fight against The Saviors, which was shown when she gunned down members of the Scavengers and the Saviors without hesitation when helping to save Alexandria. By Season 10, Carol is shown to be utterly devastated over the death of her adopted son Henry and as a result is shown to be consumed by anger, rage and a desire for vengeance and also shows signs of mental instability. She wants to personally kill Alpha, her son's killer at all costs and exterminate the Whisperers completely and is angered and disgusted at her group's unwillingness to fight back and their desire to respect Alpha's territorial boundaries to avoid further conflict. She appears to not be concerned at the potential consequences of her actions as seen when she recklessly attempts to shoot Alpha after the latter mocks her over Henry's death, appearing not to realize or care that the Whisperers could unleash their mega-horde of Walkers upon all the communities in an instant and appears to just want Alpha dead regardless. She is dedicated to learning of the Whisperer's horde's location to remove their chief weapon and give the communities a chance to fight back and personally and brutally tortures a captured Whisperer to learn it, exemplifying her desperation to kill Alpha. Her desire for vengeance also causes her to put personal relationships she has in jeopardy to benefit her mission of killing Alpha, namely with Lydia whom she lies to and attempts to use to turn the Whisperers against Alpha (due to her lying to her people that she murdered Lydia). This greatly upsets Lydia after Mary , Alpha's third-in-command, learns of her survival and she calls Carol out for using her. For this, Lydia claims Carol is just like Alpha herself, much to her shock. However, the two women eventually reconcile. Despite Daryl's best attempts to convince Carol to let go of her vendetta against Alpha, it is apparent Carol's desire for revenge has completely overclouded her common sense and adept strategic thinking as she is lured into a trap by Alpha alongside many of her allies in a cave containing the Whisperer's mega-horde, supposedly making Alpha the first adversary to be capable of outsmarting her. However, Carol is shown to have had a secret plan in the works the whole time, having secretly formed an alliance with Negan whom she had released from prison so that Negan could infiltrate the Whisperers and kill Alpha. After Negan kills Alpha and delivers Carol her foe's severed zombified head, Carol is shown to be satisfied with her revenge despite having not killed Alpha personally, which causes her friendship with Daryl to strain, as he blames her for Connie getting trapped in the cave. He tells her to run and that he won't stop her this time. Carol shows remorse for how far she went to get revenge, but Connie's sister Kelly forgives Carol, believing that Connie is still alive out there somewhere and expresses understanding for Carol's actions. In \" The Tower \", Kelly realizes that Carol thinks that the way that she is is a weakness. However, Kelly has heard the stories of Carol's actions in the old days, \"that you... you'd just go off. And do the thing that only you can do. Lone wolf.\" Rather than considering it to be a weakness, Kelly calls it Carol's superpower, like Kelly's own growing hearing loss, and she tells Carol that Carol can't give up everything about herself just because bad things happen. By Season 11, Carol is no longer consumed by anger, hatred or rage and even shows great remorse for her actions as she begs Aaron not to journey down the vengeful path she followed during the Whisperer War after Henry was killed, as killing Alpha did not bring her peace. Carol even acknowledges her reckless actions, like getting Connie and her friends hurt, something that is shown to haunt her. As a result, she helped Aaron alternatively choose forgiveness with Keith , that choice resulted in a way to fix the damage her original mistake caused, since Keith provided Carol with Connie’s last known location. After helping to rescue Connie from the Ferals , Carol is shown to be relieved and pleased by Connie's apparent lack of anger towards her with Connie even volunteering to help Carol during a bad storm . After moving to the Commonwealth , Carol is shown to enjoy a simpler life, although she makes a deal with Lance Hornsby to help him in his shadier activities in exchange for Lance getting Ezekiel treatment for his cancer. Carol also appears to have patched things up with Daryl following Connie's rescue, even affectionately teasing him over the visible attraction between Daryl and Connie and planning to have lunch with him before Sebastian 's actions interrupt their plans. During this time, Carol grows closer with her ex-husband Ezekiel again, although it's currently unclear if they will resume a romantic relationship.",
        "Pre-Apocalypse[]": "Carol lives in the outskirts of Atlanta, where she eventually met a man named Ed Peletier . He was initially charming enough for her to date and eventually marry. However, his true abusive nature would be revealed throughout the course of their marriage. She was a housewife, and she fiercely looked after their daughter, Sophia , by nurturing and providing her with comfort while Ed consistently neglected her. Throughout their marriage, Carol and her daughter were victims of verbal and physical abuse. Because of her restrained independence, she remained hesitant to inform any outsiders of the situation. Despite the abuse, Carol chose to stay married because she used to think that her idea of happiness was not being alone. An intoxicated Ed would hit her often, where several times would end with her shoulder dislocated. She learned how to heal it via the internet, due to being too embarrassed of having to return to the hospital, only to make the excuse that she had fallen down the stairs. One day, Carol decided to cut off all of her hair because when she tried to run away from Ed, he would grab her hair and slam her head against the wall. She once took Sophia to a shelter in Atlanta in an attempt to get away from Ed, but after a day and a half, they went back to him. After they went back, Ed beat them both severely.",
        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "During the onset of the outbreak, Carol and her family traveled towards a supposedly safe zone in Atlanta. On the way, they got caught in a traffic jam and befriended Shane , Lori , and Carl . While on the road, Carol tried to give some food to Carl, but Ed stopped her, saying that they would not have enough for themselves. Sometime after the city was napalmed by the military, they formed a campsite outside the outskirts of Atlanta, along with other survivors.",
