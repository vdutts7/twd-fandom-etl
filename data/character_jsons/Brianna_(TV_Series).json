Following the disappearance of a crate of Oceanside fish from the root cellar in the middle of the night, Brianna informs Yumiko about the missing food and that they were stolen during Magna 's shift. The Hilltop Colony was attacked by the Whisperers with their weaponized horde and flaming arrows, the latter of which caused the fire that quickly engulfed the settlement. Ultimately, it can be assumed that Brianna was killed by the Whisperers or the zombies that continued to push into the burning Hilltop, as she was not seen among the several survivor groups to escape Hilltop, and was never seen at any point afterwards again.",
