        "Overview[]": "Luke is a fatigued survivor who understands there is safety in numbers. He values what is beautiful and hopeful and makes people uniquely human. He’s more on the artist’s spectrum of personality, preaching the love of music as a necessity to maintain humanity during chaotic times. Among his group, he is the most jovial and friendly. As he and his group are interviewed, he is shown to be quite humble, believing he's not sure what he did to deserve to still be alive, saying he just got lucky. He acts as a voice of reason for the group, convincing Magna to not attack Alexandria , reasoning that they have kids. As a music teacher, Luke is shown to be very knowledgeable and intelligent. He cherishes his instruments and the history behind them, something his group often teases him about. At one point, Michonne sees Luke holding something and believes it to be a weapon. However, it's actually revealed to be a Stradivarius, which Michonne slices in half, something Luke becomes distraught over. Luke quickly forgives Michonne for this act. Unlike many who have become hardened survivors, Luke is very upbeat and optimistic, something quite rare this far into the apocalypse. As his group discusses whether they should join Michonne's group or take their chances on their own, Luke is the most vocal on joining believing in strength in numbers. Luke quickly becomes an accepted member of the group, volunteering to join a search party. Luke is very humorous, personable, and witty when interacting with others. He forms a friendship with Alden with the two bonding over music. Later, Luke manages to convince Alden to sing at the fair. In Season 10 , Luke becomes a member of the Coalition , helping whenever he is needed. He develops feelings for Jules , an Oceanside resident. He greatly care for her well-being, joining Michonne on her trip to Oceanside to see if she's okay after Whisperer activity is spotted. He still retains his optimistic nature, defending Virgil , since he had saved his life earlier and has photos of his family.

Using music to lure the walkers off a cliff, his plan ends up being successful.",
