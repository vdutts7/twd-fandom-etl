        "Post-Apocalypse[]": "At some point during the outbreak, Kathleen joined a community in Ohio. Kathleen sits on a couch in Pamela Milton 's office as a group of upper class citizens express their concerns and thanks to the Governor. When Yumiko barges into the office and punches one of Pamela's bodyguards, Kathleen is shocked at the incident. She and the other citizens leave the office at Pamela's request but later returns to discuss details of the press conference later that day. In the evening, Kathleen stands on the stage in the lobby of the train station alongside the press secretary and listens as Yumiko addresses the crowd. She is shocked when Yumiko announces her intent to defend Eugene and go against Governor Milton. With the city breached and many civilians killed as reported by Colonel Vickers and the screams heard throughout the invasion, Kathleen's fate is left unknown. It is possible she was let into the Estates with the crowd of terrified citizens or was rescued later on elsewhere in the city, or was killed by the undead.",
