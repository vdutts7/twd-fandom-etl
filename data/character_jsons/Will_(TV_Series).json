During a supply run in an abandoned town, the scouting party was attacked by walkers while Will was left behind by Aiden and Nicholas out of cowardice. Over time, a partially devoured Will reanimated and, due to being pinned and immobilized under a car, gradually deteriorated. When Glenn and Nicholas head out into the abandoned town to set fire to a feed store to lure walkers away, the two come across the zombified Will still pinned under a car. Feeling guilty and responsible for having caused his death, Nicholas stabs him in the head to put him down.",
