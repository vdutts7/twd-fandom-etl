        "Hershel Rhee": "Hershel Rhee",
        "Overview[]": "Hershel is an intelligent and mature boy despite his age. Unlike the other kids, Judith , Gracie , and R.J. , who have lived inside the walls of their communities, Hershel has spent a lot of his time on the road. Because of this, he appears to be a lot more experienced and accustomed to the harsh outside world. This is shown when the other kids are reluctant to eat horsemeat, while Hershel is completely fine with it and also mentions how he has eaten spiders before. He still retains some childlike innocence and gets along with the other kids and is shown to love his mother very much. Though he never met his father , he is greatly saddened by his death. When he correctly deduces that Negan is the man who killed him, he holds him at gunpoint but lowers it after some convincing. After this, Hershel greatly resents Negan. When Negan helps Hershel out of the underground hole, Hershel shoves Negan away in anger. Now a teenager in Dead City , Hershel appears to have become surly and rebellious, blowing off his weapons' training and purposefully doing the opposite of what his mother tells him to do and backtalking her. However, Hershel is also courageous, taking up a shovel and a brick to fight off the Burazi despite it being useless and defiantly refusing to give the Croat any information on Negan . He has also developed an interest in the guitar and drawing, but has abandoned his previous love of wearing hats, rejecting one that his mother offers to him as a gift after Hershel's rescue. It's later revealed that Hershel has grown angry and resentful towards his mother for her obsession with Negan, feeling that Maggie doesn't see him and is only constantly looking over his shoulder for Negan. Tired of the life that he's living, Hershel admits that he had felt safer in Manhattan than at the Bricks where he's just waiting for the next threat to come around and he believes that Maggie only came after him for her revenge upon Negan rather than to save her son. Hershel's harsh words cause Maggie to explain her reasons and to promise him that she will find a way to put everything with Negan behind her once and for all so that she can finally find peace, something that pleases Hershel. During his time in Manhattan, the Dama gained Hershel's trust and he told her about his father 's murder and Negan's role in it, although the Dama later cut off Hershel's right pinky toe. Negan continues to carry a great deal of affection for Hershel, risking his life to help Maggie on a rescue mission for the boy despite Hershel's hatred of him. During their brief reunion, Negan warmly greets Hershel who is mainly angry about his mother's continuing obsession with Negan and doesn't respond. The Dama, after having heard the story of Glenn's murder from Hershel, later notes that she could sense that Negan feels remorseful and responsible for the boy whose family he had destroyed, something that Hershel himself couldn't sense. As a result, the Dama is able to threaten Negan into compliance by using Hershel as leverage against him, even after Hershel has been released.",

With Marco 's death, Hershel, Papa Bear , and Douglas are the only named Hilltop residents confirmed to be alive. Of the three, Hershel is the only one credited throughout his appearances. Hershel appears in the archival footage shown at the beginning of \" Lockdown \" as Judith narrates past events of the show to the audience before the episode's story begins. Hershel is present in the scene in \" A New Deal \" where Pamela addresses the Commonwealth residents and blames Lance for the deaths of the many residents, however his entire body is obstructed by Mercer's body armor in the foreground due to the camera angles used, making it appear as if he is absent.
